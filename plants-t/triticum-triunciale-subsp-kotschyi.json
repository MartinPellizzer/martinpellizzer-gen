    "intro": "Triticum triunciale subsp. kotschyi, commonly known as the Kotschyi goatgrass, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its seeds are small and have a hard coat, which allows them to remain viable in the soil for extended periods. This subspecies is of interest to researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to modern wheat breeding programs."
