    "intro": "Thelypteris lumbricoides, commonly known as the creeping wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread across the forest floor. The fronds are usually biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth."
