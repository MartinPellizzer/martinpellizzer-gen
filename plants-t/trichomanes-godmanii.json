    "intro": "Trichomanes godmanii, commonly known as the Godman's water fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky surfaces. Its unique botanical features include a lack of true roots and a specialized structure for water absorption, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
