    "intro": "Trifolium stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. This plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and thrives in temperate climates. It produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, which appear in early spring. Trifolium stenophyllum is often found in meadows and along roadsides, where it plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation."
