    "intro": "Trillium maculatum f. luteum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered trillium, is a rare and striking variant of the trillium genus native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers, which contrast with its dark green, three-lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in rich, moist woodlands and thrives in partial shade. Its flowers are composed of three sepals that resemble petals, and it produces three leaf-like bracts below the flower. This fern-like plant is a member of the Melanthiaceae family and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological significance."
