    "intro": "Thymus jankae var. amabilis, commonly known as the sweet thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, aromatic leaves that are densely packed on creeping stems, forming a mat-like growth habit. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its foliage is rich in essential oils, contributing to its strong thyme scent and medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and herbal cultivation."
