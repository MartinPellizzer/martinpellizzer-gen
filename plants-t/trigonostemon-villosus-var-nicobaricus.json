    "intro": "Trigonostemon villosus var. nicobaricus, commonly known as the Nicobar ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a hairy underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
