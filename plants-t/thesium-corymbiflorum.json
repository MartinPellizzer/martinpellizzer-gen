    "intro": "Thesium corymbiflorum, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa, including South Africa. It belongs to the family Limnanthaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy habitats and has specialized structures for aquatic environments. Its leaves are usually submerged or floating, and it produces tiny, bladder-like structures that aid in capturing small aquatic organisms. Thesium corymbiflorum is a rare and delicate species, often found in specific wetland ecosystems."
