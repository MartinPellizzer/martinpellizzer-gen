    "intro": "Triticum biunciale, commonly known as the two-rowed wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces two rows of spikelets along each rachis, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a bluish-green hue. Triticum biunciale is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
