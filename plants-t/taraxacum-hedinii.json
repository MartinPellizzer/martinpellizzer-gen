    "intro": "Taraxacum hedinii, commonly known as the Hedin's dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a long, hollow stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed with a white, puffy pappus. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Taraxacum hedinii is a perennial herb that thrives in cooler climates and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils."
