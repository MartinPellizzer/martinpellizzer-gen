    "intro": "Trophaeum atrosanguineum, commonly known as the black blood orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark red to blackish-purple flowers, which are often described as resembling blood, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its flowers are spurred and have a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
