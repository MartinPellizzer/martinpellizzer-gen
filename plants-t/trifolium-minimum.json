    "intro": "Trifolium minimum, commonly known as lesser clover, is a small, low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a useful plant in agricultural and ecological restoration contexts. Trifolium minimum is also a popular choice for ornamental gardens due to its delicate appearance and ease of cultivation."
