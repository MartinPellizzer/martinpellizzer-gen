    "intro": "Thelypteris concinna var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to eastern North America. It is a perennial evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features fronds that are elongated and often arching, with a distinctive shield-shaped base. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings due to its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
