    "intro": "Trisetum alpestre f. majus, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth and slender, wiry leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its adaptability to harsh alpine conditions, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
