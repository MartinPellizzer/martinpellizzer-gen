    "intro": "Tavaresia, commonly known as the Brazilian nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers. Tavaresia species typically have smooth, glossy leaves and produce small, berry-like fruits that contain toxic compounds. They are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in a variety of habitats including forests and open fields. Due to their toxic properties, they are generally avoided by livestock and humans alike."
