    "intro": "Tamala borbonia, commonly known as the white sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, pale yellow to white timber, which is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has simple, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the branches. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing aromatic seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Tamala borbonia is now considered an endangered species in its natural range."
