    "intro": "Toxicodendron horridum, commonly known as the sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds and other wildlife. Its sap contains urushiol, a toxic compound that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. Toxicodendron horridum plays an important role in local ecosystems as both a food source and a habitat provider."
