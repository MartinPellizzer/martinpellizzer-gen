    "intro": "Thuja craigana, commonly known as the Chinese thuja, is a small evergreen conifer native to China. It features a narrow, conical shape with dense, scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green female cones, which are followed by dark blue, waxy seeds. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ornamental hedge. Thuja craigana is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of climates."
