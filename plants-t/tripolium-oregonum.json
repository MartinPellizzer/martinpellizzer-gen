    "intro": "Tripolium oregonum, commonly known as Oregon sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and disturbed areas. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Oregon sand verbena plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local pollinator populations."
