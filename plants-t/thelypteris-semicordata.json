    "intro": "Thelypteris semicordata, commonly known as the heartleaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive heart-shaped appearance in its young leaves. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and capable of producing both roots and new shoots, aiding in its spread. Thelypteris semicordata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, temperate climates."
