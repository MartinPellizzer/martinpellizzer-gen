The plant features finely divided, glossy leaves that are often curled or crisped at the edges, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
