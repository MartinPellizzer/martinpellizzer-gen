    "intro": "Tanacetopsis submarginata, commonly known as the narrow-margin goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and often have a silvery or grayish underside, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow, with a distinctive tubular shape, and bloom during the summer months."
