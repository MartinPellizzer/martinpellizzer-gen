    "intro": "Trifolium lupinaster var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-flowered trefoil, is a perennial legume native to the temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being oval-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, purple to violet flowers arranged in dense clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and along woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in nitrogen fixation, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
