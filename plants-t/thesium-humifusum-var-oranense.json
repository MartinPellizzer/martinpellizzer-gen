    "intro": "Thesium humifusum var. oranense, commonly known as the Orange Thesium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in Mediterranean climates."
