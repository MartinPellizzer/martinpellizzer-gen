    "intro": "Tillandsia pedicellata, commonly known as the clustered air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features compact rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with pale pink or white flowers, which bloom in clusters. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
