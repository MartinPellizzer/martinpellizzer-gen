    "intro": "Tilia leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-barked linden, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that becomes fissured with age, and its heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-10 centimeters in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. These flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The wood of Tilia leucocarpa is light, soft, and easy to work with, making it historically valuable for carving and construction."
