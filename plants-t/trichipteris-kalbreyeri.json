    "intro": "Trichipteris kalbreyeri, commonly known as the Kalbreyer's bladder fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, orbicular-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Trichipteris kalbreyeri plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
