    "intro": "Tetrapterys mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican winged bean, is a leguminous plant native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its compound leaves with four pairs of leaflets, giving it the common name \"winged bean.\" The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into pods containing edible seeds and a starchy, tuberous root. It is often grown for its nutritional value, as both the seeds and roots are rich in carbohydrates and protein. Tetrapterys mexicana is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a beneficial plant in sustainable agricultural systems."
