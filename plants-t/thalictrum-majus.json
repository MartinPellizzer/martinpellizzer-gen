    "intro": "Thalictrum majus, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are arranged in a spikelike inflorescence. These flowers are typically pollinated by insects, and the plant thrives in moist, shady environments. Thalictrum majus is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and its ability to attract pollinators."
