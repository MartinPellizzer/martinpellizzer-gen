    "intro": "Tricholaena tonsa var. submutica, commonly known as the velvet bamboo, is a variant of the Tricholaena genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous, and somewhat leathery leaves that give it a velvety texture. The plant typically grows as a clumping bamboo, forming compact, upright clusters with a moderate growth rate. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a slightly rough surface, which distinguishes it from other bamboo species. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and adaptability to various soil conditions."
