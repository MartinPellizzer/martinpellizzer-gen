It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically oval or elliptic in shape, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to violet flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
