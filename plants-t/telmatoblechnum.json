    "intro": "Telmatoblechnum, commonly known as the Andean water bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant found in the high-altitude lakes of South America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that help it float and trap oxygen. The plant's leaves are typically submerged, while its flowers emerge above the water surface. Telmatoblechnum is adapted to cold, oligotrophic environments, making it a specialist in these extreme habitats. Its presence is often an indicator of pristine, unpolluted water bodies."
