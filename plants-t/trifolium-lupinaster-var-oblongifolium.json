It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval to oblong leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
