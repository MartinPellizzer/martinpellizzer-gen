    "intro": "Trifolium wormskioldii var. kennedianum, commonly known as the Kennedian clover, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which typically consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming in early spring. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
