    "intro": "Tanaecium paniculatum, commonly known as the yellow panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in panicles. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is adapted to warm climates and is relatively drought-tolerant. Tanaecium paniculatum is sometimes used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive, feathery appearance."
