    "intro": "Tetrastigma havilandii, commonly known as the Chinese crossvine, is a vigorous climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pentafoliate, and its clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit. Tetrastigma havilandii is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
