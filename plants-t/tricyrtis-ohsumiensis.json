    "intro": "Tricyrtis ohsumiensis, commonly known as the Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Japan, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant features delicate, pale greenish-white flowers with a unique, ghost-like appearance, which give it its common name. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tricyrtis ohsumiensis is considered a vulnerable species, making it a subject of interest for conservation efforts."
