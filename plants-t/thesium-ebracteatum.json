    "intro": "Thesium ebracteatum, commonly known as the naked thesium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of fleshy, narrow leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its flowers are often subtended by bracts, though the species name \"ebracteatum\" suggests a reduction or absence of these structures. Thesium ebracteatum is adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal or inland regions with low rainfall."
