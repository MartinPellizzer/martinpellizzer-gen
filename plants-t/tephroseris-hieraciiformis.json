    "intro": "Tephroseris hieraciiformis, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are basal, arranged in a rosette, and are covered with a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The showy yellow flowers appear in spring, followed by distinctive bracts that give the plant its common name."
