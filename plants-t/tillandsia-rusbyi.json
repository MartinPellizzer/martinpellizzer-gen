    "intro": "Tillandsia rusbyi, commonly known as the Rusby's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, grass-like foliage that forms a rosette, which helps collect moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of white or pink. Tillandsia rusbyi is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to thrive."
