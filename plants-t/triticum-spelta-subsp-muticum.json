    "intro": "Triticum spelta subsp. muticum, commonly known as intermediate rye, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and spikelet structure. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a flowering period that occurs in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is less commonly cultivated than other rye varieties but is valued for its potential in ecological restoration and as a forage crop."
