Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a lobed appearance, contributing to its ornamental value. The flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female blooms, and are typically yellow with a white or greenish throat. This species is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is cultivated for both its edible fruits and ornamental appeal."
