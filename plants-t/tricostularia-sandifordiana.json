    "intro": "Tricostularia sandifordiana, commonly known as the sandiford's tricostularia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Acanthaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
