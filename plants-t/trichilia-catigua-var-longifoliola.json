It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often clustered in terminal panicles, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
