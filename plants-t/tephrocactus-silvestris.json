    "intro": "Tephrocactus silvestris, commonly known as the desert rose cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, light green to pale blue stems that often have a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Tephrocactus silvestris is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for desert gardens."
