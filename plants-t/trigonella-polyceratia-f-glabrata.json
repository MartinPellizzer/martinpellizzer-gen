    "intro": "Trigonella polyceratia f. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth trigonella, is a variant of the trigonella species characterized by its glabrous (hairless) foliage. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported health benefits. The smooth trigonella is valued for its adaptability to harsh environments and its potential medicinal properties."
