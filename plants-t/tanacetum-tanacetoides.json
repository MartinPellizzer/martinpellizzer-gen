    "intro": "Tanacetum tanacetoides, commonly known as tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant is characterized by its strong, aromatic scent, which comes from compounds such as thujone and camphor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Tanacetum tanacetoides is also known for its historical use in herbal medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
