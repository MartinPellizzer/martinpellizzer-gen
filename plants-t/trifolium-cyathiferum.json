    "intro": "Trifolium cyathiferum, commonly known as the yellow trefoil, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Europe and western Asia and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences called cyathia, which give it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Trifolium cyathiferum is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing abilities, making it useful in soil enrichment."
