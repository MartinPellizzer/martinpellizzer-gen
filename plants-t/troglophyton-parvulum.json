    "intro": "Troglophyton parvulum, commonly known as the cave bladderwort, is a small, aquatic plant found in dark, moist environments such as caves and subterranean water systems. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures used for trapping small prey. The plant is adapted to low-light conditions and relies on photosynthesis in dimly lit habitats. It has a simple morphology with short, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. Troglophyton parvulum plays a unique ecological role in subterranean ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling in nutrient-poor environments."
