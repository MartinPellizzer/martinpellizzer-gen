    "intro": "Trifolium agrarium, commonly known as the field clover, is a flowering plant species belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stalk. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. Trifolium agrarium is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It plays an important role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
