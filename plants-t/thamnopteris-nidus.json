    "intro": "Thamnopteris nidus, commonly known as the rock holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often clustered together. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, humid environments. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Thamnopteris nidus is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
