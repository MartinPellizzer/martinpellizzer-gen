    "intro": "Tephrosia arabica, commonly known as the Arabian tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters, featuring slender, branching stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Tephrosia arabica is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil and low rainfall. It is often used in traditional medicine and has potential applications in sustainable agriculture."
