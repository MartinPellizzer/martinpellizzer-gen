    "intro": "Taraxacum orientali-atratum, commonly known as the Caucasian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of elongated, hairy leaves. The plant produces a hollow, wind-dispersed seed stem topped with a distinctive crown of bracts. It thrives in rocky and alpine habitats, often growing at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
