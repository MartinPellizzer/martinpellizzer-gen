    "intro": "Tephroseris pierotii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with gray-green, fuzzy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions and store water efficiently. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday. Tephroseris pierotii is well adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
