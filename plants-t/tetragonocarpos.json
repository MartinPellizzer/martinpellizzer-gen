    "intro": "Tetragonocarpos, commonly known as the four-angled fruit tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its woody shrubs or small trees that typically have opposite, simple, and often four-angled leaves. The flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers usually occurring on separate plants, a feature known as dioecy. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. This genus is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
