    "intro": "Trichomanes hymenoides var. pseudoreptans, commonly known as the false wall-r Moss, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and small, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a prominent midrib and a serrated or toothed margin. This variety is distinguished from the typical Trichomanes hymenoides by its more elongated and less curled leaf shape. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native environment."
