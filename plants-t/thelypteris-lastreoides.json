    "intro": "Thelypteris lastreoides, commonly known as the rock brake, is a fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Southeast Asia. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, which is a characteristic feature of ferns. Thelypteris lastreoides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms."
