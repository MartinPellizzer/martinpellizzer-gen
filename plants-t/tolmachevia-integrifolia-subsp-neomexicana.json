    "intro": "Tolmachevia integrifolia subsp. neomexicana, commonly known as the New Mexico leafless cholla, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often leafless, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It produces yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
