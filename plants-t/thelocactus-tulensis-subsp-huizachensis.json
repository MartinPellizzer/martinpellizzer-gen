    "intro": "Thelocactus tulensis subsp. huizachensis, commonly known as the Huizachense Thelocactus, is a rare cactus native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the top of the stem. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species."
