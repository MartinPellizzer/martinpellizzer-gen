    "intro": "Taraxacum camuratum, commonly known as the Camuratum dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which are typical of the genus Taraxacum. This species is native to parts of Central Asia and is often found in meadows and grassy areas. It is a perennial plant that produces a distinctive seed head composed of white, pappus-equipped seeds that are easily dispersed by wind."
