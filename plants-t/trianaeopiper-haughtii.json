It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
