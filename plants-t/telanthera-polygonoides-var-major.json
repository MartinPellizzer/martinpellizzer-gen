    "intro": "Telanthera polygonoides var. major, commonly known as the large-flowered telanthera, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period, which extends from late spring through early autumn."
