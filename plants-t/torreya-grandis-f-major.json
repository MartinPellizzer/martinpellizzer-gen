    "intro": "Torreya grandis f. major, commonly known as the Chinese torreya, is a rare evergreen conifer native to eastern China. It is characterized by its elongated, needle-like leaves that are dark green and glossy, arranged in spirals along the branches. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years, typically releasing seeds in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for shaded garden environments. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
