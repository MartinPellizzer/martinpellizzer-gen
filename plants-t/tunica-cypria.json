    "intro": "Tunica cypria, commonly known as the Cyprus tunica, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, which features a thick, waxy cuticle to adapt to arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to efficiently absorb moisture from the soil. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Tunica cypria is considered endangered in its native range."
