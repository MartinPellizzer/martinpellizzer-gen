It is characterized by its dense, rounded form and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for garden borders or as a specimen plant. Its slow growth rate and ornamental shape make it a popular choice for formal landscaping."
