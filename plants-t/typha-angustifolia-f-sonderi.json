    "intro": "Typha angustifolia f. sonderi, commonly known as narrow-leaved cattail, is a variant of the common cattail species. It is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves and cylindrical flower spikes. This plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
