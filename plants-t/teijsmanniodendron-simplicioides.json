It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically odd-pinnate with lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in panicles, followed by woody, chestnut-like fruits that contain one or two seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in evergreen forests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
