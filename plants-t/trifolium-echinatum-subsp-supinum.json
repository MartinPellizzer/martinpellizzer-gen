    "intro": "Trifolium echinatum subsp. supinum, commonly known as the hooked trefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically dark green and have a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. The subspecies is distinguished by its hooked, spiny stems and its preference for higher elevation habitats."
