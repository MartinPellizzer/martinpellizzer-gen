    "intro": "Trichipteris pansamalana, commonly known as the golden fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that exhibit a striking golden hue, especially when exposed to sunlight. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in dense rainforests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of many fern species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Trichipteris pansamalana is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
