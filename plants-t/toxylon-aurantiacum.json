    "intro": "Toxylon aurantiacum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to the arid regions of central and northern Africa, where it thrives in sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure and compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. Its flowers are small and yellowish, typically arranged in dense, spherical clusters. The tree is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which has been historically used for carving and construction."
