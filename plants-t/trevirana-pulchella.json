    "intro": "Trevirana pulchella, commonly known as the beautiful trevirana, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Trevirana pulchella thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
