    "intro": "Tillandsia pabstiana, commonly known as the Pabst air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it blooms once in its lifetime. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
