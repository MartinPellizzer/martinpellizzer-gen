    "intro": "Tricostularia, commonly known as the three-ribbed lichen, is a type of lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive thallus structure, which consists of a crust-like, foliose, or fruticose growth form. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in various environmental conditions. Tricostularia species are typically found on bark, rocks, or soil surfaces in temperate and boreal regions. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for air quality and ecological health."
