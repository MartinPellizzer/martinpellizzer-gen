It is characterized by its aromatic, small, grey-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and herb gardens. This variety is often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its fragrant properties."
