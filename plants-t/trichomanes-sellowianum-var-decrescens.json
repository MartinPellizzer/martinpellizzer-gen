    "intro": "Trichomanes sellowianum var. decrescens, commonly known as the Sellow's maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to South America. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that resemble those of the common maidenhair fern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
