    "intro": "Taxus \u00d7 media f. hatfieldii, commonly known as the Hatfieldii yew, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and distinctive red, fleshy aril-covered seeds. It is a hybrid between Taxus cuspidata and Taxus mairei, exhibiting a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant's foliage remains vibrant throughout the year, making it an ornamental choice for gardens and landscapes. It prefers well-drained, acidic soil and partial to full shade, thriving in cooler climates. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
