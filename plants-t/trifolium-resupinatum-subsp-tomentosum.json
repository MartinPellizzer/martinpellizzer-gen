    "intro": "Trifolium resupinatum subsp. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in a dense, woolly pubescence, giving the plant its common name. The small, pink to violet flowers are clustered in racemes and bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
