    "intro": "Trillium erectum f. viridiflorum, commonly known as the green-flowered wake-robin, is a rare botanical variant of the red trillium. It is characterized by its distinctive greenish-yellow flowers, which contrast with the typical red blooms of the species. This fern-like plant has three broadly ovate leaves that are arranged in a whorl at the base. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. The plant is notable for its unique floral coloration and is considered a botanical curiosity due to its rarity."
