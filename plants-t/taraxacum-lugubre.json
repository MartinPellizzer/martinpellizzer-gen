    "intro": "Taraxacum lugubre, commonly known as the gloomy dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and a tall, slender stem that bears a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, typical of the dandelion genus. It produces a distinctive, elongated seed head that releases seeds with parachute-like structures. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in temperate climates."
