    "intro": "Themistoclesia smithiana, commonly known as the Smith's thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, spherical fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
