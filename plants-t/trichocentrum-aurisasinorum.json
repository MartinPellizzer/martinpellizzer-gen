    "intro": "Trichocentrum aurisasinorum, commonly known as the Aurisasinum orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain water in its natural habitat. The orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
