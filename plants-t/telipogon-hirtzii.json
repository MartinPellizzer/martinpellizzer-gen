    "intro": "Telipogon hirtzii, commonly known as the hairy telipogon, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high elevations of South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in rocky or forested areas at altitudes above 2,000 meters. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Telipogon hirtzii is considered endangered in many regions."
