    "intro": "Taraxacum parsennense, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant is herbaceous, with a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and grayish-green in color. It produces a long, slender stem that bears a single flower head, which develops into a fluffy seed head after blooming. Taraxacum parsennense is adapted to cold, alpine environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations."
