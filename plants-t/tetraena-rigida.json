    "intro": "Tetraena rigida, commonly known as the rigid tetraena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a splash of color to its dry habitat. It is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments, with mechanisms to store water and reduce transpiration. Tetraena rigida is often found in rocky soils and is a common component of fynbos vegetation in its native range."
