    "intro": "Tithymalopsis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed tithymalopsis, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. The leaves are usually narrow and elongated, with a slightly serrated edge. These plants are native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, often growing in grassy or rocky habitats. They are generally herbaceous perennials, though some species may behave as annuals depending on the climate."
