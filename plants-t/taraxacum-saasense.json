    "intro": "Taraxacum saasense, commonly known as the Saas Valley dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Switzerland. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hairy stem. The plant produces a bright yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed ball. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat."
