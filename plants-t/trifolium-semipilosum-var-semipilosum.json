    "intro": "Trifolium semipilosum var. semipilosum, commonly known as the silky clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to native plant gardens. Its low-growing habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
