    "intro": "Tropidia emeishanica, commonly known as the Emeishan rock orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking purple to violet flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous regions, where it thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade. Its botanical features include pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and it produces showy, fragrant blooms during the spring season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tropidia emeishanica is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
