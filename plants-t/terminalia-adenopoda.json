    "intro": "Terminalia adenopoda, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and elliptical leaves with a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested or semi-deciduous regions. Terminalia adenopoda is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction."
