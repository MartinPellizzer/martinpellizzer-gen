    "intro": "Thelypteris decadens, commonly known as the decaying fern, is a species of fern found in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris decadens plays a role in nutrient cycling within its ecosystem due to its rapid decomposition."
