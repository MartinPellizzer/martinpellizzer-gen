    "intro": "Trichipteris submarginalis, commonly known as the narrow-margin fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive narrow margin that sets it apart from other fern species. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the leaves. Trichipteris submarginalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded gardens."
