    "intro": "Thymus vulgaris var. varia, commonly known as lemon thyme, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, creeping growth habit and small, gray-green leaves that emit a citrus-like aroma. The plant produces pink to lavender flowers in the spring, which are attractive to pollinators. Lemon thyme is widely used in culinary applications and herbal medicine due to its high concentration of essential oils. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
