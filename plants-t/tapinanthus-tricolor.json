    "intro": "Tapinanthus tricolor, commonly known as the three-colored dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind or animals. The plant has a unique life cycle, with a seedling stage that attaches to a host and then develops into a mature plant. It is native to Africa and thrives in arid environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and native vegetation."
