    "intro": "Tonningia glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous staghorn fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a tree-like structure with a central stem and multiple fronds that are typically lance-shaped and leathery. Its leaves are usually dark green and can grow quite large, sometimes reaching lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests where it attaches to trees or rocks."
