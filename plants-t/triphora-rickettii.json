It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and thrives in cool, shaded environments. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the late spring and summer. Triphora rickettii is often found in association with other alpine flora and is an important component of the mountain ecosystem."
