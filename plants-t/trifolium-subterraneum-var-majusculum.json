    "intro": "Trifolium subterraneum var. majusculum, commonly known as the greater yellow clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. This plant is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and fixes nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Due to its ecological benefits and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in agricultural and landscaping settings."
