    "intro": "Tripogandra cumanensis f. glabrior, commonly known as the smooth-leaved tripogandra, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology, including its clustered growth habit and distinctive leaf structure. The foliage is notably smoother and less hairy compared to the typical form of the species, which is a key distinguishing feature. This plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a plant of conservation interest."
