    "intro": "Tropidocarpum, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. It is native to various regions in South America, particularly the Andes, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plants are shrubs or small trees, often characterized by their showy, five-petaled flowers that come in a range of colors, including white, yellow, and red. Tropidocarpum species are known for their ability to withstand cold temperatures and poor soil conditions, making them resilient in mountainous regions. Their botanical significance lies in their unique adaptations to high-altitude ecosystems and their role in local biodiversity."
