    "intro": "Taraxacum potaninii, commonly known as the Potanin's dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and a long, hollow stem that terminates in a yellow composite flower head. Native to Central Asia, this species is often found in dry meadows and grasslands. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common feature among the genus Taraxacum. It is considered a minor weed but has potential in traditional medicine and ecological studies."
