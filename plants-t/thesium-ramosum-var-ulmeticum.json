    "intro": "Thesium ramosum var. ulmeticum, commonly known as the bog thesium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It has slender, branched stems that often lie close to the ground, and its small, clustered flowers are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and requires consistent moisture to thrive. Thesium ramosum var. ulmeticum plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland habitats."
