    "intro": "Trichipteris villosa, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are an important feature for its reproductive cycle."
