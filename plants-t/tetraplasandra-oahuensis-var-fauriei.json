    "intro": "Tetraplasandra oahuensis var. fauriei, commonly known as the Oahu hibiscus, is a rare endemic plant found exclusively on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native, often dry habitat. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the unique microclimates of the island. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
