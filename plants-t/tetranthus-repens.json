    "intro": "Tetranthus repens, commonly known as creeping tetranthus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features wiry, sprawling stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs. Tetranthus repens is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
