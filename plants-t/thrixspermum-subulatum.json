    "intro": "Thrixspermum subulatum, commonly known as the needleleaf thrixspermum, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of silky hair, giving it a distinctive, soft appearance. Thrixspermum subulatum is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or well-drained soils."
