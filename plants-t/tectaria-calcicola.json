    "intro": "Tectaria calcicola, commonly known as the limestone tectaria, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Tectaria calcicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to mineral-rich soils."
