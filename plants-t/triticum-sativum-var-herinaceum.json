    "intro": "Triticum sativum var. herinaceum, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy or bristly awns on its glumes and lemma, which give it its common name. This plant is often found in dry, disturbed soils and can thrive in arid environments. It has been historically used in traditional agriculture and is considered a potential source for modern crop improvement. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying wild relatives of cultivated wheat."
