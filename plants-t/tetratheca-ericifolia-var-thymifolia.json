    "intro": "Tetratheca ericifolia var. thymifolia, commonly known as the thyme-leaved tetratheca, is a low-growing shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features small, ovate leaves with a dense covering of fine hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring. It is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and inland environments. Its foliage is aromatic, with a scent reminiscent of thyme, hence its common name."
