    "intro": "Therofon heucheriforme, commonly known as the silverleaf sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features a rosette of dark green, waxy leaves that are often tinged with silver on the upper surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of green and yellow, typically in late spring. Its leaves contain compounds that can be used in traditional medicine, though they should be handled with care. Therofon heucheriforme thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade."
