    "intro": "Tillaea aquatica var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate watercress, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This variety is closely related to other members of the Brassicaceae family, sharing similar structural and physiological traits."
