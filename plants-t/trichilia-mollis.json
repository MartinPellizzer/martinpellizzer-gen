    "intro": "Trichilia mollis, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other valuable hardwoods. The tree is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and alternate, ovate leaves with a glossy upper surface. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in panicles, while the fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. Trichilia mollis is valued for its hard, heavy wood used in furniture and carving, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
