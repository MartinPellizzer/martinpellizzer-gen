    "intro": "Tradescantia cumanensis, commonly known as the Cumanensis spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, branching stems that often trail along the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Tradescantia cumanensis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
