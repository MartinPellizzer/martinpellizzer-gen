    "intro": "Tilia macrocarpa, commonly known as the American basswood or large-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically large and have a smooth, often hairy underside. The tree produces small, fragrant yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. These flowers are an important food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a distinctive flaky texture that becomes more pronounced with age."
