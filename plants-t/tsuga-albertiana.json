    "intro": "Tsuga albertiana, commonly known as the Albert's hemlock, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the genus Tsuga, which includes other species of hemlocks, and is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, typical of conifers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests alongside other conifers such as Douglas fir and western red cedar. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and parks across regions with suitable climates."
