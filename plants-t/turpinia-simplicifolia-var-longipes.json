    "intro": "Turpinia simplicifolia var. longipes, commonly known as the long-peduncled Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in terminal clusters, followed by orange to red drupes that are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along waterways. Due to its ornamental value and ecological adaptability, it has been introduced to various regions outside its native range."
