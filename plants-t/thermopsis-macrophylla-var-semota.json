It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant features basal leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a hairy texture, and tall, branching stems that support its vibrant floral display. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
