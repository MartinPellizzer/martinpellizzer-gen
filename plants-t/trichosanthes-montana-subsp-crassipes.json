    "intro": "Trichosanthes montana subsp. crassipes, commonly known as the broad-leaved bitter melon, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins and produces yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elongated, orange-colored fruits. The plant is characterized by its robust stems and hairy foliage, which help it thrive in humid, tropical environments. Its fruit is edible when mature but is known for its bitter taste, often used in traditional medicine and cuisine. The subspecies is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to other Trichosanthes species."
