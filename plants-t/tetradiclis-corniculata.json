    "intro": "Tetradiclis corniculata, commonly known as the horned milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, horn-shaped seed pods. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Tetradiclis corniculata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
