    "intro": "Tetranthera reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined grass, is a member of the Poaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered spikelets, which are typical of many grass species. The botanical features of Tetranthera reticulata make it well-adapted to its native habitats, contributing to its ecological significance in those regions."
