    "intro": "Trifolium lacerum, commonly known as the shredded clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often irregularly lobed and appear shredded or frayed. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Trifolium lacerum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
