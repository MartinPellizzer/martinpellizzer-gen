    "intro": "Triticum nardus, commonly known as narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as dunes and grasslands. Triticum nardus is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
