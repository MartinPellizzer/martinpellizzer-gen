    "intro": "Tripteris kraussii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. Tripteris kraussii is known for its hard, heavy wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
