    "intro": "Trillium lanceolatum var. rectistamineum, commonly known as the straight-stemmed wake-robin, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features three lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish at the base and a single, showy white or pale pink flower with three petals and three sepals. The plant typically grows in rich, moist woodland soils and blooms in early spring. Its flowers have six stamens, with the filaments being straight rather than curved, a distinguishing feature of this variety. It is an important species for pollinators and is often found in shaded, undisturbed habitats."
