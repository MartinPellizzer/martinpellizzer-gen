    "intro": "Trevia discolor, commonly known as the variable blushing plant, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, variable leaf coloration that ranges from deep green to vibrant red or purple, depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the wet season. Trevia discolor is often found in moist, shaded understories of rainforests, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
