    "intro": "Taraxacum czaunense, commonly known as the Czaun dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Central Asia and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a crown of white, feathery seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
