    "intro": "Tillandsia armadae, commonly known as the Armada air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
