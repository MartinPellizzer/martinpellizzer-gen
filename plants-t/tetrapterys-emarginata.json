    "intro": "Tetrapterys emarginata, commonly known as the margined leaf tamarind, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its alternate, pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive marginal notch, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing flat, edible seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
