    "intro": "Tessmannia africana, commonly known as the African thornapple, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and spiny leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of local ecosystems."
