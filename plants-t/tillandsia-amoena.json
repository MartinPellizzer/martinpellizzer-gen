    "intro": "Tillandsia amoena, commonly known as the pink air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically pink or red, adding to its ornamental appeal. Tillandsia amoena is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
