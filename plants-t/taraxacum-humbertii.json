    "intro": "Taraxacum humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive yellow composite flower that develops into a fluffy white seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. The species is noted for its hardiness and ability to thrive in marginal environments."
