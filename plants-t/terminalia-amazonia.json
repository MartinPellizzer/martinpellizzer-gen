    "intro": "Terminalia amazonia, commonly known as the Amazonian tamarind tree, is a deciduous tree native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elongated, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into woody, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its fruit is valued for its edible seeds, which have a sweet, nutty flavor and are used in local cuisines. The plant also plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity within its native habitat."
