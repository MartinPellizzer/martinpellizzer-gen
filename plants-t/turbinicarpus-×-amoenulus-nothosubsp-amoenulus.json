    "intro": "Turbinicarpus \u00d7 amoenulus nothosubsp. amoenulus, commonly known as the hybrid moon cactus, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Turbinicarpus subulatus and Turbinicarpus lehmannianus. It is characterized by its unique appearance, featuring a brightly colored upper part (the pseudostem) and a lower, often greenish body (the true stem). The plant is a succulent, adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. It has small, spiky leaves that are usually reduced to tubercles, and it produces yellow or orange flowers during the growing season. This nothosubspecies is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of care."
