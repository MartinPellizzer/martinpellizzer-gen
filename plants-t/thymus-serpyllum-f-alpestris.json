It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and pink to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Its compact growth habit and hardy nature make it suitable for rock gardens and alpine displays. The leaves are used in cooking and traditional medicine, similar to other thyme species."
