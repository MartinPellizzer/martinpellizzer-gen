    "intro": "Trillium maculatum f. simulans, commonly known as the spotted trillium, is a rare and striking botanical specimen native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Trillium genus, characterized by its three-parted leaves and showy, three-petaled flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, with white petals that often have a faint pink or red hue. Its unique foliage features a distinctive red or purple spot on the underside of the leaves, which is a key identifying trait. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species requiring careful conservation efforts."
