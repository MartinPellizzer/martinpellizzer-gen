    "intro": "Thymus apricus, commonly known as the Turkish thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, aromatic foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves contain essential oils rich in thymol, giving it a strong, pungent aroma. Thymus apricus is often used in culinary applications and traditional medicine due to its antimicrobial properties."
