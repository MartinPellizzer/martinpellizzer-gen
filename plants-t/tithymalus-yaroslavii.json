    "intro": "Tithymalus yaroslavii, commonly known as the Yaroslav's tithymalus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within its native range."
