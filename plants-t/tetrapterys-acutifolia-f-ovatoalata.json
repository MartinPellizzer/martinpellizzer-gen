    "intro": "Tetrapterys acutifolia f. ovatoalata, commonly known as the ovate-leaved acutifoliate tetrapterys, is a variant of the tetrapterys genus native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its ovate to elliptical leaves, which are typically smaller and more rounded compared to the standard species. The plant exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with multiple branches, and its leaves are often covered in a fine, pubescent layer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The botanical interest of this form lies in its unique leaf morphology and its potential ecological role in its native habitat."
