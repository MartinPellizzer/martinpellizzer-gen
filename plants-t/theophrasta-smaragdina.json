    "intro": "Theophrasta smaragdina, commonly known as the emerald jewel orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often covered in a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
