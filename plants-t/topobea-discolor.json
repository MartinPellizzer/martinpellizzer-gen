It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its disc-shaped flower heads and pale green to white petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Topobea discolor is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
