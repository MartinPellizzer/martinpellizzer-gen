    "intro": "Taraxacum nakaii, commonly known as the Japanese dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairless stem. The plant produces a single, large, yellow composite flower that develops into a spherical seed head with white, feathery seeds. It is native to East Asia, particularly Japan, Korea, and China, and thrives in moist, temperate climates. Taraxacum nakaii is often found in meadows, gardens, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators."
