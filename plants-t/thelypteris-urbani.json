    "intro": "Thelypteris urbani, commonly known as the urban shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a shield-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Thelypteris urbani is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
