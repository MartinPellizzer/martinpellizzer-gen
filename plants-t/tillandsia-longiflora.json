    "intro": "Tillandsia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its most distinctive characteristic is its long, pendant inflorescence bearing small, white to pale purple flowers. Tillandsia longiflora is well adapted to humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
