    "intro": "Taraxacum gilvum, commonly known as the golden dandelion, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower. Its flowers produce seeds with white, feathery pappi that are easily dispersed by the wind. The golden dandelion is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
