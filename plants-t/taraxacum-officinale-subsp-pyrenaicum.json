    "intro": "Taraxacum officinale subsp. pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pyrenees region. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a hollow, stemless fruit known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to other dandelion species."
