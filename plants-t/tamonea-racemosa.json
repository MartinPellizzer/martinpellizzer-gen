    "intro": "Tamonea racemosa, commonly known as the purple false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in racemes during the spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, legume-like pods that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Tamonea racemosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
