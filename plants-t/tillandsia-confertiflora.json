    "intro": "Tillandsia confertiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its striking inflorescence produces clusters of vibrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Tillandsia confertiflora is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
