    "intro": "Tilia argentea var. orbicularis, commonly known as the silver-leafed lime or orbicular linden, is a deciduous tree native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, silvery-white leaves that give it a striking appearance, especially in the summer. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, round, brown fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
