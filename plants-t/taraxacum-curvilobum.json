    "intro": "Taraxacum curvilobum, commonly known as the curlyleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are often curly or wavy at the edges. The plant produces a single, hollow, hairless stem that rises above the leaves to bear a single flower head. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in the spring, followed by the characteristic seed heads that produce wind-dispersed seeds. The plant is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows."
