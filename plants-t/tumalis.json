    "intro": "Tumalis, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and broad, ovate leaves that are usually bright green. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests and coastal areas. Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it an important species for coastal ecosystem stability."
