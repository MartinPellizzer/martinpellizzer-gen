    "intro": "Tapinanthus nitidulus, commonly known as the glossy dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a fibrous, root-like structure called a haustorium that attaches to its host. The plant is native to parts of Africa and is often found parasitizing species of Acacia. Its lack of leaves and its vine-like growth habit make it distinctive among parasitic plants. It plays a role in ecological systems by influencing the growth and distribution of its host species."
