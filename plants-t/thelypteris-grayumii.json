    "intro": "Thelypteris grayumii, commonly known as the Gray's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris grayumii plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
