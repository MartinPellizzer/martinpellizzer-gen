    "intro": "Thelypteris assamica, commonly known as the Assam holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering. Thelypteris assamica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
