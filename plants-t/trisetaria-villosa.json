    "intro": "Trisetaria villosa, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Trisetaria villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
