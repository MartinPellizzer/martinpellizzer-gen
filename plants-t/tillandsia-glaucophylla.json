    "intro": "Tillandsia glaucophylla, commonly known as the silver-leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps it retain moisture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
