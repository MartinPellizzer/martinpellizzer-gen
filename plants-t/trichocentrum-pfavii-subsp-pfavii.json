    "intro": "Trichocentrum pfavii subsp. pfavii, commonly known as the Pfeiffer's orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant features elongated, strap-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. Its flowers are striking, with showy, fragrant blooms that range in color from white to pale yellow. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
