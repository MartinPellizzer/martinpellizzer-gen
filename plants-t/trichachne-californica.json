    "intro": "Trichachne californica, commonly known as California trichachne, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Trichachne californica is often used in native plant landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ecological benefits."
