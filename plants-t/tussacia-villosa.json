    "intro": "Tussacia villosa, commonly known as the woolly tussac, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Poaceae family, commonly referred to as the grass family. The plant is characterized by its dense, wiry, and hairy growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-white flowers. Tussacia villosa is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, where it adapts well to poor soil conditions."
