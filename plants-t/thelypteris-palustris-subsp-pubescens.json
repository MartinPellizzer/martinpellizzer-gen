    "intro": "Thelypteris palustris subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent marsh holly fern, is a fern species native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in environments such as swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in maintaining ecological balance in wetland ecosystems."
