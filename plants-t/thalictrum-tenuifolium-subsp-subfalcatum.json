    "intro": "Thalictrum tenuifolium subsp. subfalcatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly curved. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are arranged in elongated racemes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
