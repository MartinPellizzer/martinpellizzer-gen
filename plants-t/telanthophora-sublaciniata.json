It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Telanthophora sublaciniata is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
