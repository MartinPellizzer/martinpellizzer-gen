    "intro": "Trochiscus cochlearioides, commonly known as the African horned vulture, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its woody stems and small, spiny leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for wildlife."
