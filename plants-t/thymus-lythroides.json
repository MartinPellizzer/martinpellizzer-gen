    "intro": "Thymus lythroides, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces small, pinkish-white to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has aromatic, finely textured leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Thymus lythroides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, drought-tolerant mats."
