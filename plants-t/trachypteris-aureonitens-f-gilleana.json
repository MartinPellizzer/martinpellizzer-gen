    "intro": "Trachypteris aureonitens f. gilleana, commonly known as the golden nettle fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds and unique botanical features. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance due to the finely divided segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and is often grown in shaded, humid environments."
