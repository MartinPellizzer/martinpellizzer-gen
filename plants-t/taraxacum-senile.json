    "intro": "Taraxacum senile, commonly known as the old man's beard, is a species of dandelion native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender bracts that resemble a beard, giving it its common name. The plant produces a single, short, and often pale yellow flower at the top of a hollow stem. Its leaves are deeply lobed and form a basal rosette, typical of many dandelion species. Taraxacum senile is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates."
