    "intro": "Trichomanes javanicum var. asplenioides, commonly known as the Java water fern, is a fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of the fronds. This variety is closely related to other members of the Trichomanes genus, sharing similar morphological features and ecological preferences."
