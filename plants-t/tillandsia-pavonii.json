    "intro": "Tillandsia pavonii, commonly known as the velvet tassel bromeliad, is a species of air plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety coating of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright red or orange bracts and small, tubular flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
