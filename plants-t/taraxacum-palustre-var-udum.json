    "intro": "Taraxacum palustre var. udum, commonly known as the marsh dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem that bears a yellow composite flower head, typical of the dandelion genus. Its flowers are followed by a distinctive pappus of bristles that aids in seed dispersal. This variant is adapted to moist soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
