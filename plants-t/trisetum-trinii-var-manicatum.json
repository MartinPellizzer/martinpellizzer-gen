    "intro": "Trisetum trinii var. manicatum, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, silky-textured leaves that give it a soft appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, greenish-brown flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its ornamental value is often appreciated in horticulture for its lush, carpet-like foliage."
