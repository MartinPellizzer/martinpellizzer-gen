    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudosachalinense, commonly known as the Sakhalin dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the Russian Far East, particularly the island of Sakhalin, and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem that supports its flower head, which typically consists of numerous small florets. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
