    "intro": "Tillandsia picta, commonly known as the picta air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating to help retain moisture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. Tillandsia picta is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
