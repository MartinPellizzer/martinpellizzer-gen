    "intro": "Tieghemella jollyana, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
