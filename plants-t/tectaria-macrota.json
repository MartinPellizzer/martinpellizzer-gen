    "intro": "Tectaria macrota, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Tectaria macrota is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in maintaining forest floor ecosystems."
