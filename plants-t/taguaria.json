    "intro": "Taguaria, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. It is native to regions of South America, particularly the Andes, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plants typically have showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. They are often found growing in rocky or mountainous terrain, where they adapt to cool and humid conditions. Taguaria species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
