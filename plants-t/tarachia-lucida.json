    "intro": "Tarachia lucida, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Tarachia lucida plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its habitat."
