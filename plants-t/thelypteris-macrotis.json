    "intro": "Thelypteris macrotis, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped outline, and produce sporangia on the underside of the leaves."
