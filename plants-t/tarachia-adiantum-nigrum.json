    "intro": "Tarachia adiantum-nigrum, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive blackish or brownish coloration on the underside. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The black fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
