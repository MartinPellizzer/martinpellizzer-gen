    "intro": "Tragia tabulaemontana, commonly known as the Mexican burr plant, is a flowering plant native to parts of Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its spiny, bract-like structures that encase its small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, often found in disturbed soils and arid environments. Its fruit develops into a hard, spiny capsule that disperses seeds through wind or animal contact. The botanical features of Tragia tabulaemontana make it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
