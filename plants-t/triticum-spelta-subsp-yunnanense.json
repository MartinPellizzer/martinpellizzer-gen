    "intro": "Triticum spelta subsp. yunnanense, commonly known as Yunnan spelt, is a lesser-known wild wheat species native to China. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and glumes that are typically shorter than the lemma. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with palea and lemma that are often hairy. Its grains are generally smaller and more elongated compared to cultivated wheat varieties. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to specific environmental conditions."
