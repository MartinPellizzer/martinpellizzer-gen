    "intro": "Triticum pseudocaninum, commonly known as the wild wheat or goatgrass, is a species of grass belonging to the Poaceae family. It is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that contain small, hard grains. It is closely related to cultivated wheat species and has been studied for its potential in breeding programs. Due to its genetic diversity, it plays a role in agricultural research and conservation efforts."
