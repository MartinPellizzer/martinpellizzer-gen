    "intro": "Triticum spelta var. muticum, commonly known as intermediate rye, is a lesser-known variant of spelt wheat. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in meadows and along riverbanks. The plant has a robust root system and produces\u7a57 that are shorter and more compact than those of common wheat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is valued for its hardiness and potential use in ecological and agricultural contexts."
