    "intro": "Turraea parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered turraea, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Turraea parvifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
