    "intro": "Tupistra elegans, commonly known as the silver carpet plant, is a low-growing evergreen succulent native to southern Africa. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value comes from its striking appearance and ability to form a dense, decorative carpet."
