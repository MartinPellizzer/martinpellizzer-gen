    "intro": "Temnemis scouleri, commonly known as the Pacific silver fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest in North America. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate rainforests. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
