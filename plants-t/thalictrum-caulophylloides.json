It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in compound racemes. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and unique floral structure, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
