    "intro": "Thamnopteris, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. These plants are characterized by their finely divided, often feathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. Thamnopteris species are often found in moist, shaded environments, such as stream banks and rocky crevices. They possess a unique ability to thrive in waterlogged soils, which is reflected in their common name. The genus includes several species, each with variations in frond morphology and habitat preferences."
