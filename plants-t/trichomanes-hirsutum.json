    "intro": "Trichomanes hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy moonwort, is a small, fern-like plant belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, wiry fronds and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a unique rhizome system that allows it to anchor itself in rocky substrates. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Trichomanes hirsutum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
