    "intro": "Tillandsia sagasteguii, commonly known as the Sagastegui air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with striking violet or pink flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal soil, as it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Due to its unique appearance and rarity, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
