    "intro": "Taraxacum longipyramidatum, commonly known as the longipyramidal dandelion, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright, sparsely hairy stem and deeply lobed, alternate leaves. The plant produces a single, elongated flower head that develops into a spherical, fluffy seed head. It is native to central and eastern Europe and is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it distinct from other dandelion species, particularly in its leaf morphology and stem structure."
