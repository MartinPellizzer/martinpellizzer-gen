    "intro": "Taraxacum fennorodiae, commonly known as the Fennoscandian dandelion, is a perennial flowering plant native to northern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head composed of yellow ray florets. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and forest edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range."
