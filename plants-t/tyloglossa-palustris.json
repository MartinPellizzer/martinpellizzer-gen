    "intro": "Tyloglossa palustris, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in North America. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, with five petals and a distinctive spurred lip. The plant has heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often submerged or floating in shallow water. Its root system helps stabilize soil and improve water quality in marsh habitats. Tyloglossa palustris plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
