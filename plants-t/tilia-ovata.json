    "intro": "Tilia ovata, commonly known as the large-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically large and have a smooth, glossy surface. The tree produces fragrant, white flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and attract pollinators such as bees. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often developing shallow fissures with age. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
