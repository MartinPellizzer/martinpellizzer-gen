    "intro": "Trichocereus catamarcensis, commonly known as the Catamarca cactus, is a species native to Argentina. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny stems and ability to store water efficiently. The plant produces white flowers during the night, a trait common among many cacti adapted to arid environments. Its structure allows it to thrive in high-altitude regions with limited rainfall. Trichocereus catamarcensis is also known for its potential use in traditional medicine and as a source of psychoactive compounds."
