    "intro": "Turbinicarpus horripilus, commonly known as the hairy turbinated cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a distinctive ribbed structure and spines that are often covered in a fine, hairy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
