    "intro": "Trilepis rehmanniana, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its robust, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming during the summer months. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Trilepis rehmanniana is well adapted to survive in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures."
