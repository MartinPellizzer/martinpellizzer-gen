    "intro": "Tilia dasystyla subsp. dasystyla, commonly known as the large-leaf lime, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often larger than those of other lime species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
