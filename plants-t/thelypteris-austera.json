It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a reddish hue when young. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris austera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
