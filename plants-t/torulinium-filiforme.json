    "intro": "Torulinium filiforme, commonly known as the slender torulinium, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the short growing season. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky crevices. Its botanical structure includes a short, fibrous root system and a stem that grows close to the ground. Due to its limited habitat and low population numbers, it is considered a vulnerable species."
