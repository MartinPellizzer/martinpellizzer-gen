    "intro": "Tragia mairei, commonly known as the Maire's tragia, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub or subshrub that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, characterized by its small, often hairy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Tragia mairei is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with mechanisms to conserve water and tolerate high temperatures. It is often found in rocky soils and is an important component of local flora in its native habitat."
