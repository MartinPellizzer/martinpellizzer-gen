It is characterized by its elongated petioles, which distinguish it from the typical form of Trigonella monspeliaca. This subspecies is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. It is often cultivated for its seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and culinary applications."
