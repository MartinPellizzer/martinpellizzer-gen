    "intro": "Tragopogon graminifolius subsp. serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering goat's beard, is a perennial herb native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom late in the growing season. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils. It produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is part of the genus Tragopogon, which includes several species known for their distinctive leaf and flower structures."
