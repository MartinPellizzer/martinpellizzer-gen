It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features finely divided, feather-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters that attract pollinators like bees and flies. Tricercandra is valued in horticulture for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
