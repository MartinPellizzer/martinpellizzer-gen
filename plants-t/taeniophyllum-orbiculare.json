    "intro": "Taeniophyllum orbiculare, commonly known as the orbiculate moss, is a small, terrestrial moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a compact morphology with short, branching stems and small, ovate leaves that are often curled at the tips. It is well adapted to humid, shaded habitats and is often found on rocks or soil in tropical and subtropical regions. Taeniophyllum orbiculare plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native ecosystems."
