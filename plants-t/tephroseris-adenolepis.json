    "intro": "Tephroseris adenolepis, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family. It is a large, evergreen tree fern characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves. The plant has a distinctive, fibrous root system that helps it anchor in the moist, shaded environments of its native habitat. Its fronds are typically dark green and can grow up to several meters in length. Tephroseris adenolepis plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's forests, providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
