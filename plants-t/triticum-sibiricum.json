    "intro": "Triticum sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and steppe regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
