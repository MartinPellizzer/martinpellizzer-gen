It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Trifolium oxypetalum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
