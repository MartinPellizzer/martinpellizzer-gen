    "intro": "Tillandsia brevilingua, commonly known as the short-tongued air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Due to its unique structure and ability to thrive in humid environments, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
