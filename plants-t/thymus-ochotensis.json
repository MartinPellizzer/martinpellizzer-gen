    "intro": "Thymus ochotensis, commonly known as Siberian thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Siberia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. Thymus ochotensis thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
