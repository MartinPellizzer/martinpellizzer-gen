It features small, gray-green leaves with a dense covering of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces tiny white or pinkish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This variety is valued for its aromatic foliage and is often used in herbal teas and culinary applications."
