It is characterized by its distinctive tuberous roots and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The subspecies subglabra is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous fruits, which set it apart from other forms of the species. Native to southern Africa, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in suitable climates."
