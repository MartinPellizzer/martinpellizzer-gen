    "intro": "Theodorea elongata, commonly known as the elongated theodorea, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Theodorea elongata is considered a species of conservation concern."
