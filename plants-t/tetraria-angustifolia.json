    "intro": "Tetraria angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tetraria, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Tetraria angustifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a relatively uncommon species, with limited geographic distribution in North America."
