It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Its rapid growth and hardiness make it a common ornamental and stabilizing plant in coastal landscapes."
