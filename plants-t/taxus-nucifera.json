    "intro": "Taxus nucifera, commonly known as the Chinese yew or water pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slow growth rate and long lifespan, often living over 1,000 years. The plant has scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, arranged in flattened sprays. Its cones are small and produce seeds that are dispersed by water, a feature adapted to its wetland habitats. The tree is also valued for its ornamental beauty and has cultural significance in traditional Chinese medicine."
