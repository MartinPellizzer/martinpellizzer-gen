    "intro": "Thibaudia multiflora, commonly known as the velvetleaf or swamp mallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety hair, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Thibaudia multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and has also been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
