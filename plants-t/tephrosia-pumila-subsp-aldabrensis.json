It is characterized by its small, simple leaves that are often reduced or absent, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to saline and arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
