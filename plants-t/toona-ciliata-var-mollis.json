It is characterized by its smooth, pale to dark grey bark that often has a velvety texture. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy upper surface and a hairy underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy timber used in construction and furniture-making."
