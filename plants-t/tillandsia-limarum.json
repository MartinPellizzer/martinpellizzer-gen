    "intro": "Tillandsia limarum, commonly known as the silver-tipped air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It thrives in humid environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth. Tillandsia limarum is popular as a low-maintenance ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities."
