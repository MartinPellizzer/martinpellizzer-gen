    "intro": "Taraxacum carpaticum, commonly known as the Carpathian dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a pappus-equipped seed sphere. Native to the Carpathian Mountains, it thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant is perennial, with a taproot system that allows it to survive harsh environmental conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
