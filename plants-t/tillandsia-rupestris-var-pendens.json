    "intro": "Tillandsia rupestris var. pendens, commonly known as the hanging air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup to collect rainwater, which the plant uses for hydration. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically on trees or rocks in humid environments. Its foliage is often adorned with small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
