    "intro": "Trichilia trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leafed tamarind, is a tropical tree native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three leaflets that are usually oval or elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, edible seeds. Its bark is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in various soil types."
