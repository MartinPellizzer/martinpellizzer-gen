    "intro": "Tanacetum quercifolium, commonly known as oak-leaf tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble the shape of oak leaves, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Tanacetum quercifolium is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along roadsides, where it contributes to biodiversity in its native habitats."
