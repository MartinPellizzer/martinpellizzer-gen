    "intro": "Triticum durum f. taganrocense, commonly known as the Taganrog durum wheat, is a botanical variant of durum wheat characterized by its unique genetic traits. It is native to the southern regions of the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia, where it thrives in semi-arid climates. The plant exhibits distinct morphological features, including shorter stature and specialized glumes, which contribute to its adaptability. Its grains are typically hard and high in protein, making it suitable for durum semolina production. This subspecies is of interest to researchers due to its potential for improving drought resistance in wheat breeding programs."
