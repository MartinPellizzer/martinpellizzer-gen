    "intro": "Taraxacum harpagoides, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which develop into the familiar white, fluffy seeds. The plant is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed soils. It is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its diuretic and digestive benefits."
