    "intro": "Taenitis blechnoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes often covered in a layer of brownish, scaly tissue. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
