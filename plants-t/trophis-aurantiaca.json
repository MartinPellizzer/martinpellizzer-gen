    "intro": "Trophis aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden bell vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its long, pendulous clusters of bright orange to red tubular flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible and often used in local cuisines. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for ornamental purposes in gardens and as a shade provider. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a glossy surface, contributing to its aesthetic appeal."
