    "intro": "Toechima dasyrrhache, commonly known as the hairy thistle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to regions of southern Africa, this plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant's hairy texture helps reduce water loss, adapting it to arid environments. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
