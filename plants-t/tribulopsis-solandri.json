It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects for stabilizing sandy soils."
