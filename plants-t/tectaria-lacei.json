    "intro": "Tectaria lacei, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with finely divided segments that create a feathery appearance. Tectaria lacei is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
