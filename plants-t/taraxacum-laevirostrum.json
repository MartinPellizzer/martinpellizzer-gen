    "intro": "Taraxacum laevirostrum, commonly known as the smooth-beak dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, elongated stem that ends in a yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in seed travel. This species is often found in moist to wet soils in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks."
