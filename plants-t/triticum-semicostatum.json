    "intro": "Triticum semicostatum, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the North America. It is characterized by its tall stature, typically reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters, and its dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered in panicles, with each spikelet containing several lemmas and paleas. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a bluish-green color and a prominent midrib, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Triticum semicostatum is valued for its potential in sustainable agriculture and forage production."
