    "intro": "Tapura neglecta, commonly known as the neglected tapura, is a rare and lesser-known plant species. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its botanical features include small, lance-shaped leaves and unassuming white flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
