    "intro": "Taraxacum mutabile, commonly known as the variable dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lanceolate leaves and a hollow, cylindrical stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive yellow composite flower that develops into a crown of white, feathery seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Taraxacum mutabile exhibits variability in leaf shape and flower size, which contributes to its common name."
