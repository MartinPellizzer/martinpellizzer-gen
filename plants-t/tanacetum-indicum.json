    "intro": "Tanacetum indicum, commonly known as Indian tansy, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas and parts of southern Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring a basal rosette of leaves and tall, branching stems. The plant produces small, yellowish to white composite flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which are characteristic of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are aromatic, with a strong, camphor-like scent, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. Tanacetum indicum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky areas."
