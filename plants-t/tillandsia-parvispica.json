    "intro": "Tillandsia parvispica, commonly known as the miniature tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces. Tillandsia parvispica produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
