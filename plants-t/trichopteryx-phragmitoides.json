It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, forming a thick vegetation cover that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers, contributing to its role in wetland ecosystems. Trichopteryx phragmitoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
