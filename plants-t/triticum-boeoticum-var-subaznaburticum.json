    "intro": "Triticum boeoticum var. subaznaburticum, commonly known as the Armenian wild wheat, is a wild relative of cultivated wheat species. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. This plant typically grows in temperate regions, often in disturbed or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a flowering period that occurs in late spring to early summer. It is of interest to researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to harsh conditions."
