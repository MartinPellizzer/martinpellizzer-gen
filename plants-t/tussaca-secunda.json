    "intro": "Tussaca secunda, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in shades of pink, white, and yellow. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water while anchoring the plant in place. Tussaca secunda is also culturally significant in many Asian countries, symbolizing purity and spiritual enlightenment."
