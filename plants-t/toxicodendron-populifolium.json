    "intro": "Toxicodendron populifolium, commonly known as the smoothleaf poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its alternate, trifoliate leaves that are typically smooth and have a reddish or greenish hue. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. It is known for its urushiol oil, which can cause severe skin irritation in humans. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided and can be difficult to control in natural and managed landscapes."
