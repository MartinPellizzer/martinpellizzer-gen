    "intro": "Thalictrum cruciatum, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features slender, often arching stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with prominent stamens. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has finely divided, fern-like leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, dry fruits that contain a single seed. Thalictrum cruciatum is valued in gardens for its delicate appearance and ecological benefits."
