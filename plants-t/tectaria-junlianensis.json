It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and the production of two types of fronds: sterile and fertile. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, intricate venation pattern. Tectaria junlianensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
