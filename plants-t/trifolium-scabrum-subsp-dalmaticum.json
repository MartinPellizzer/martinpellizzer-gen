    "intro": "Trifolium scabrum subsp. dalmaticum, commonly known as Dalmatian clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, typically with three oval to oblong leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant prefers well-drained soils and can thrive in sunny to partially shaded environments. It is often found in grasslands, rocky areas, and along coastal regions. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
