    "intro": "Tubella tenuis, commonly known as the slender tube worm, is a species of polychaete annelid found in marine environments. It is characterized by its elongated, segmented body and the presence of a prominent, tube-like structure used for respiration and protection. The plant, though not a true plant, is often studied for its ecological role in coastal ecosystems. It thrives in sandy or muddy substrates and is commonly found in shallow waters. Its morphology and behavior make it an important part of benthic communities."
