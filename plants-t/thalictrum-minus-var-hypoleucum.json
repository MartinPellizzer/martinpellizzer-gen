    "intro": "Thalictrum minus var. hypoleucum, commonly known as the white meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, often hairy stems that grow up to 1 meter tall, bearing compound leaves with finely divided, fern-like lobes. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, arranged in racemes along the stem. Its flowers are actinomorphic, with sepals and petals that are nearly identical in size and shape. This variety is distinguished by its pale coloration and is often found in moist meadows and woodland edges."
