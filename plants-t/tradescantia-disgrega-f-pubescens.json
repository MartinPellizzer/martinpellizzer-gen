    "intro": "Tradescantia disgrega f. pubescens, commonly known as the velvet leaf spiderwort, is a cultivar of the spiderwort genus native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its velvety, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive texture and appearance. The plant typically features small, vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its delicate, short-lived blossoms."
