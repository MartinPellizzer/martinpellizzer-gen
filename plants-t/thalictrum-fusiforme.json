    "intro": "Thalictrum fusiforme, commonly known as the narrowleaf meadow-rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often arching stems and delicate, compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in upright, branched inflorescences. Thalictrum fusiforme thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
