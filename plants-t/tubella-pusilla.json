    "intro": "Tubella pusilla, commonly known as the small tubella, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, cryptogamic plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a leafy, flattened body that lacks true roots, stems, or leaves. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are borne on the upper surface of the thallus. Tubella pusilla plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
