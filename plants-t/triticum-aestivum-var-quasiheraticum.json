    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. quasiheraticum, commonly known as the near-herbaceous wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its unique growth habit. This variety exhibits a more herbaceous appearance compared to typical wheat, with thinner stalks and a more fibrous structure. It is primarily found in temperate regions where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant's morphology suggests adaptations to cooler climates and possibly shorter growing seasons. Its study contributes to understanding genetic diversity within the wheat genus."
