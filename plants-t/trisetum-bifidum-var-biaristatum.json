    "intro": "Trisetum bifidum var. biaristatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf basket grass, is a perennial grass species native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The inflorescence consists of compact, cylindrical clusters of spikelets, which are typically green to brown in color. This variety is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
