    "intro": "Teucrium granatense var. atlanticum, commonly known as Atlantic germander, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments or along the edges of salt marshes. Its adaptability to coastal conditions makes it an important component of maritime ecosystems."
