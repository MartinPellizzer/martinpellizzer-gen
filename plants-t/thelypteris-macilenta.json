    "intro": "Thelypteris macilenta, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sori are arranged in a single row along the margins of the fertile leaves, and the spores are released during the late spring and summer months. Thelypteris macilenta is a relatively small fern, making it a subtle yet distinctive addition to woodland ecosystems."
