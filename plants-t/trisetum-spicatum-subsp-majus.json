    "intro": "Trisetum spicatum subsp. majus, commonly known as the tall beakgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and the inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often arranged in a compact, spikelike structure. Trisetum spicatum subsp. majus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
