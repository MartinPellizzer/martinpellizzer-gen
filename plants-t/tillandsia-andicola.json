    "intro": "Tillandsia andicola, commonly known as the Andean air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's leaves are typically long and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern to capture moisture from the air. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires indirect sunlight. Tillandsia andicola is known for its ability to absorb water and nutrients through its leaves, making it well adapted to its natural habitat."
