    "intro": "Taraxacum acriculum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which develop into the familiar white, fluffy seed heads. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects."
