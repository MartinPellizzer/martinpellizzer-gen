    "intro": "Tillandsia aloides, commonly known as the silver vulture, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has stiff, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, and it produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive. Tillandsia aloides is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
