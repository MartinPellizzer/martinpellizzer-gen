    "intro": "Typhalea peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as yellow, orange, and red. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its native high-altitude environment. Its leaves are usually elongated and grass-like, adapting to the cool, moist conditions of its habitat. Typhalea peruviana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
