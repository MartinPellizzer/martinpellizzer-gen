    "intro": "Taraxacum santandricum, commonly known as the Santander dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to South America, particularly Colombia, and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces a distinctive seed head that disperses its seeds via the wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
