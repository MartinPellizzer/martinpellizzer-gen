    "intro": "Tetrapterys pusilla, commonly known as the small-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees. It possesses small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in dispersal by birds. Tetrapterys pusilla is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host trees."
