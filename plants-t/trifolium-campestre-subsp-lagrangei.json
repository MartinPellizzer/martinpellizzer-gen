It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a slender stem. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
