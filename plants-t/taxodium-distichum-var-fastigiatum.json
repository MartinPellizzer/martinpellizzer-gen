    "intro": "Taxodium distichum var. fastigiatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bald cypress, is a deciduous conifer native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, columnar growth habit and narrow, feather-like leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, and its bark is thick, scaly, and reddish-brown. It thrives in wet, swampy environments and is often found in bottomland hardwood forests. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in riparian zones."
