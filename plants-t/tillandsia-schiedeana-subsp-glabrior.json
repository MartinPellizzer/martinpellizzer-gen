    "intro": "Tillandsia schiedeana subsp. glabrior, commonly known as the silver tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, silvery bloom of trichomes, which help in water absorption. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically pink or purple and bloom during the rainy season. This subspecies is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in terrariums and hanging gardens."
