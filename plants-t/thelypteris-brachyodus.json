    "intro": "Thelypteris brachyodus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or drooping in appearance. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes often covered in a layer of brownish, velvety tissue. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it prefers moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. Thelypteris brachyodus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
