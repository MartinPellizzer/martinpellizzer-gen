    "intro": "Teucrium polium f. doumerguei, commonly known as the Algerian germander, is a rare and distinct form of the common teucrium species. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its aromatic, grey-green foliage and small, clustered flowers. This plant is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in Algeria and surrounding areas. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically valuable species."
