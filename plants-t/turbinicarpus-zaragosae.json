    "intro": "Turbinicarpus zaragosae, commonly known as the Zaragoza turbinated cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its globular, ribbed stem that is typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its striking appearance and slow growth rate, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
