    "intro": "Tragopogon dubius subsp. desertorum, commonly known as the desert sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and basal rosettes of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by slender, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some areas."
