    "intro": "Thelypteris pozoi subsp. mollissima, commonly known as the velvet shield fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that give it a soft, velvety texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, aiding in nutrient absorption. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
