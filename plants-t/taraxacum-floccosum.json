    "intro": "Taraxacum floccosum, commonly known as the fluffhead dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, hairy, and often bluish-green leaves. The plant produces a single, elongated flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head, which later develops into a fluffy white pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
