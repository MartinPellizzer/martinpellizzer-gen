    "intro": "Toxicodendron rydbergii, commonly known as the Rydberg poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to the central and eastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in forest edges. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a fine layer of urushiol, a potent skin irritant. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
