    "intro": "Thymus vulgaris var. capitatus, commonly known as rose thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces aromatic, needle-like leaves that are rich in essential oils, particularly thymol and carvacrol. These compounds contribute to its strong, minty fragrance and medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for both culinary and ornamental use."
