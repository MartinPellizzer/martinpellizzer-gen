    "intro": "Taraxacum triforme, commonly known as the three-lobed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of elongated, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a spherical seed ball. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in a variety of habitats including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is known for its ability to spread through wind-dispersed seeds, making it a common sight in open areas. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a familiar weed in many regions."
