It is characterized by its lance-shaped, glabrous (smooth) leaves and vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies. Spiderwort is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
