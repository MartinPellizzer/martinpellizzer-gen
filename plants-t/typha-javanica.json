    "intro": "Typha javanica, commonly known as the Javan cattail, is a perennial wetland plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically brown or purple in color. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense clusters around the base. Its rhizomes are extensive and help it spread vegetatively across wetland habitats. Typha javanica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
