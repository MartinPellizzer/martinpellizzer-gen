    "intro": "Triticum speltoides subsp. aucheri, commonly known as Armenian wheat, is a wild grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Anatolia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments and has narrow, linear leaves with a rough texture. Its seeds are small and hard, adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. This species is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to modern wheat breeding programs."
