    "intro": "Taraxacum brachyglossum f. argutum, commonly known as the hairy leaf dandelion, is a botanical variant of the dandelion species characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and hairy leaf blades. This form is native to southern Europe and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant produces a single, yellow flower head that develops into a white, spherical seed ball, typical of the Compositae family. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough texture and prominent veins, contributing to its identification. The hairy leaf dandelion is a perennial herb that thrives in temperate climates and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
