    "intro": "Tragia urens var. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and dry forests. Tragia urens var. lanceolata is adapted to arid conditions and has a strong, sometimes prickly stem structure."
