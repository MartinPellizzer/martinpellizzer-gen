    "intro": "Thunbergia hyalina, commonly known as the glassy moon vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, waxy leaves that give it a translucent appearance, especially when backlit. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue, often with a yellow throat. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires support for its vine-like growth habit. Thunbergia hyalina is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
