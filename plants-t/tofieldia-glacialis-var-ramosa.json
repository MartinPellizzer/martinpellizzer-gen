    "intro": "Tofieldia glacialis var. ramosa, commonly known as the Arctic tussock grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat."
