    "intro": "Tianschaniella wakhanica, commonly known as the Wakhan lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found in the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is typically crustose and tightly adherent to rock surfaces. The organism is a symbiotic composite of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found on bare rock or soil in mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an indicator species for high-altitude ecosystems."
