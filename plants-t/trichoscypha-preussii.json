    "intro": "Trichoscypha preussii, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Bombacaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, red flowers. The tree produces woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is valued for its durable, heavy timber and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
