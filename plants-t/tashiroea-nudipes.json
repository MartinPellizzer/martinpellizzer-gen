    "intro": "Tashiroea nudipes, commonly known as the naked-footed tashiroea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tashiroea nudipes is considered a conservation concern."
