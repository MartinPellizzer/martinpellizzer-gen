    "intro": "Torrubia cephalantha, commonly known as the red-flowered heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces vibrant red flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a humid, coastal climate. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
