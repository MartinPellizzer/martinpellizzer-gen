    "intro": "Tectaria quitensis, commonly known as the Andean shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, protective layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. Tectaria quitensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
