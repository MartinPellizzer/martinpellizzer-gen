    "intro": "Trifolium carmelii, commonly known as Carmel clover, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
