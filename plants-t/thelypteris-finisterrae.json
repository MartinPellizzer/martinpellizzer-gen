    "intro": "Thelypteris finisterrae, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos shield fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is a medium-sized fern with lance-shaped, evergreen fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant has a thick, leathery rachis and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-like appearance due to the arrangement of its pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing near streams or in rocky crevices. Thelypteris finisterrae plays an important ecological role in the unique flora of the Gal\u00e1pagos ecosystem."
