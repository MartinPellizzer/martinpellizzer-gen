    "intro": "Telipogon montufariana, commonly known as the Montufaria orchid, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that bloom in the early spring. The plant has a short, erect stem with a single, showy inflorescence that contains several small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts in its native range."
