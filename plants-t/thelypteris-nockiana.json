    "intro": "Thelypteris nockiana, commonly known as the Nock's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Thelypteris nockiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful foliage."
