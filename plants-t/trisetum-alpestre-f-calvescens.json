    "intro": "Trisetum alpestre f. calvescens, commonly known as the alpine false brome, is a rare and specialized grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Alps. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh mountain environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
