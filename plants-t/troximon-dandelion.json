    "intro": "Troximon dandelion, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its distinctive yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are hairy and slightly lobed. After flowering, it produces a hollow, parachute-like seed head called a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. The dandelion is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies for centuries."
