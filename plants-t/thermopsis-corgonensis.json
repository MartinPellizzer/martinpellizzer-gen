    "intro": "Thermopsis corgonensis, commonly known as the mountain yellowroot, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features a robust root system and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
