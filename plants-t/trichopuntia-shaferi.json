    "intro": "Trichopuntia shaferi, commonly known as the Shafer's century plant, is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a monocarpic plant, meaning it flowers only once in its lifetime before dying. The plant produces a tall, spire-like inflorescence composed of numerous white to pale purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted for water storage. Trichopuntia shaferi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
