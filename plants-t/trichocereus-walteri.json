    "intro": "Trichocereus walteri, commonly known as the \"Walter's torch cactus,\" is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Bolivia and Argentina. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems and the ability to produce large, showy night-blooming flowers. The plant is adapted to extreme desert conditions, with deep roots and a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers, typically white or pale yellow, are pollinated by bats and moths, which are active during the night. Trichocereus walteri is also valued for its potential use in traditional medicine and as a decorative plant in cactus collections."
