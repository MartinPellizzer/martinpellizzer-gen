It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Myanmar, and is characterized by its deciduous nature, shedding its leaves during the dry season. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its bark is smooth and greyish, while its leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptic in shape. The fruit is a small, woody drupe that contains a single seed, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing food for various wildlife species."
