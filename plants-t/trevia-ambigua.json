    "intro": "Trevia ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous trevia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers. The plant has opposite, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its stems are often woody and branched. Trevia ambigua is typically found in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
