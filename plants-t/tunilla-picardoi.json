    "intro": "Tunilla picardoi, commonly known as the Picard's tunilla, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is adapted to thrive in rocky, arid environments. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pale blue or violet, appearing in clusters during the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tunilla picardoi is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat degradation."
