    "intro": "Tapinanthus marginatus, commonly known as the parasitic dodder, is a flowering plant that exhibits a unique parasitic lifestyle. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, attaching itself through specialized haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that can spread over its host. It is native to various regions in Africa and is often found on plants such as Acacia and Euphorbia. Its botanical interest lies in its complex relationship with host plants and its role in ecological interactions."
