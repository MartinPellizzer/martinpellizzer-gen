    "intro": "Taraxacum acrocuspidatum, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and a single, erect stem that bears a yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive pappus of bristles that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. This species is notable for its resilience to harsh climatic conditions and its ecological role in supporting pollinators in mountainous regions."
