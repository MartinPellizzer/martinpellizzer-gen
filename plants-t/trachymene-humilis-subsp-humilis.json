    "intro": "Trachymene humilis subsp. humilis, commonly known as the common blue mistflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern Australia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces small, blue or purple flowers arranged in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understoreys. It has a creeping habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its botanical name reflects its characteristic mist-like appearance due to the fine, feathery foliage."
