    "intro": "Tillandsia gruberi, commonly known as the Gruber's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect and retain moisture. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of white or pale pink. Tillandsia gruberi is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its ability to absorb nutrients and water through its leaves."
