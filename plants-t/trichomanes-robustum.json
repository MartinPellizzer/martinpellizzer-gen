    "intro": "Trichomanes robustum, commonly known as the robust maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green and possess a leathery texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes robustum plays a role in maintaining forest floor biodiversity and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
