It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or drooping in appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to the substrate. Thelypteris abrupta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
