    "intro": "Trifolium dichotomum var. turbinatum, commonly known as the turbinated clover, is a variant of the dichotomous clover species. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant communities and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
