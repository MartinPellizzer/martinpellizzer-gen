    "intro": "Tilia betulifolia, commonly known as the silver linden, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it typically grows to a height of 15 to 30 meters. The silver linden is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in supporting local wildlife."
