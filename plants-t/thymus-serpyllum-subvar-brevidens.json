    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum subvar. brevidens, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features aromatic, tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, giving it a dense, carpet-like appearance. The plant produces small, pink to lavender flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for both ornamental and medicinal purposes."
