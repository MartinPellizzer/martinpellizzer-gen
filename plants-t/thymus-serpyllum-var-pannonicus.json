It features small, dark green, aromatic leaves and produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky soils. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, known for its aromatic properties and medicinal uses. This variety is closely related to other thyme species but is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and slightly different foliage structure."
