It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forest and woodland habitats. Due to its fragrant wood, it has been traditionally used in the production of incense and medicinal preparations."
