    "intro": "Telipogon obovatus, commonly known as the broad-ovate orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers with a distinctively shaped lip. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are usually pale green or yellowish in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telipogon obovatus is considered a vulnerable species."
