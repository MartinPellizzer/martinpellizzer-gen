    "intro": "Trigonochilum saltabundum, commonly known as the bouncing orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, erect, and often pendulous inflorescence that resembles a bouncing motion in the wind. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers with three petals and three sepals, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
