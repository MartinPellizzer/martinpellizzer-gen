    "intro": "Trifolium villosum, commonly known as hairy clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Trifolium villosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
