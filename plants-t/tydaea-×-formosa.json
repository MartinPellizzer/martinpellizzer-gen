    "intro": "Tydaea \u00d7 formosa, commonly known as the hybrid reed or marsh reed, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Tydaea canadensis and Tydaea angustifolia, exhibiting characteristics of both parents. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with slender, erect stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Tydaea \u00d7 formosa plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
