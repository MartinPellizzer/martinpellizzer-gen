    "intro": "Tragia mitis var. arabica, commonly known as the desert glorybower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight."
