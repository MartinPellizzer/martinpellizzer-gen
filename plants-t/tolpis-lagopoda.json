It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its upright, branching stems covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense layer of trichomes.
