    "intro": "Thecacoris gymnogyne, commonly known as the common lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. It thrives in a variety of environments, including bark, soil, and rocks, and is often found in temperate regions. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the fungal partner. The algal component provides photosynthetic capabilities, while the fungus offers protection and absorbs nutrients. This unique relationship allows Thecacoris gymnogyne to colonize harsh environments where individual organisms might not survive."
