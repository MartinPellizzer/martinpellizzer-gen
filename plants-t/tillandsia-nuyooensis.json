    "intro": "Tillandsia nuyooensis, commonly known as the Nuyooensian air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in humid environments."
