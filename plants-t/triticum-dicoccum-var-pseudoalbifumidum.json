    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum var. pseudoalbifumidum, commonly known as black wheat, is a variant of spelt wheat characterized by its dark, almost black grain. This variety is notable for its high protein content and distinct nutty flavor, making it popular in artisanal baking. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is native to the Fertile Crescent, where it has been cultivated for thousands of years. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stems and spike-like inflorescences. Its grains are encased in a tough, inedible hull, which is removed during processing to reveal the edible endosperm."
