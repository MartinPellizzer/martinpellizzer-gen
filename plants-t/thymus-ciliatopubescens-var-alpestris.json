    "intro": "Thymus ciliatopubescens var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, gray-green leaves that are densely covered with fine, hairy pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid, high-altitude habitat. The plant produces tiny, pink or violet flowers in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens as a drought-tolerant, aromatic plant."
