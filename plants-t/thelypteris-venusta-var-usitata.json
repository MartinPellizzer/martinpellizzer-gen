    "intro": "Thelypteris venusta var. usitata, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a variant of the common shield fern native to the southeastern United States. It is a compact, evergreen fern with fronds that are typically 15\u201330 cm long, featuring a distinctive golden to bronze coloration on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided, serrate leaflets that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance."
