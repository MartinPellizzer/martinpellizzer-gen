    "intro": "Tristania merguensis, commonly known as the Tristania tree, is a species native to the remote Tristan da Cunha archipelago in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a small, evergreen tree that typically grows in coastal and rocky habitats. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tristania merguensis is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
