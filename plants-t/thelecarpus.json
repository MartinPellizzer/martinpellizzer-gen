    "intro": "Thelecarpus, commonly known as the broadleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their broad, lance-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in spring. Thelecarpus species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. They often grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swamps. The fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to their dispersal in natural habitats."
