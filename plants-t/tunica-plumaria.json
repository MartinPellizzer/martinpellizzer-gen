    "intro": "Tunica plumaria, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Tunica plumaria is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils make it an invasive species in many areas."
