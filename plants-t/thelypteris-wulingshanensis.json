    "intro": "Thelypteris wulingshanensis, commonly known as the Wuling Mountain shield fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds with a distinctive, shield-shaped indusium. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Thelypteris wulingshanensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
