    "intro": "Triticum timonovum, commonly known as Timonov's wheat, is a rare and little-studied species of wheat native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are adapted to thrive in cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous\u9896\u82b1, which contain the characteristic wheat grains. Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, it holds potential for agricultural research and breeding programs. However, its cultivation is challenging due to its specific ecological requirements and low yield potential."
