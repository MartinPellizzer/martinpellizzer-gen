    "intro": "Thelypteris pustulosa, commonly known as the blister fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in the Americas. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and fronds that are typically pinnately compound. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive cycle involves the release of spores, which germinate into gametophytes, completing the alternation of generations."
