It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Teclea gerrardii produces small, oval fruits called cypsela, which are dispersed by wind. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to native gardens and ecological restoration projects."
