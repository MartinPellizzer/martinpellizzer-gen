    "intro": "Toxicoscordion nuttallii, commonly known as the western apocynum, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. The plant features showy, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, while its stems are covered in fine, white hairs. Toxicoscordion nuttallii contains cardiac glycosides, making it highly toxic to both humans and animals if ingested."
