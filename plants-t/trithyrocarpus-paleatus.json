    "intro": "Trithyrocarpus paleatus, commonly known as the pale leaf cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones, which are typically found on separate male and female plants. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires a warm, sunny climate to flourish. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
