    "intro": "Thelypteris miyagii, commonly known as the Miyagi holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive holly-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris miyagii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
