    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. ischkaschimicum, commonly known as the Ischkaschim wheat, is a rare and little-known variant of common wheat. It is characterized by its unique morphological features, including distinct glumes and awns, which set it apart from other wheat species. This variety is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, where it adapts to cold and harsh environmental conditions. Its botanical traits make it of interest to researchers studying genetic diversity in wheat. However, due to its limited distribution and low yield, it remains a minor species in agricultural contexts."
