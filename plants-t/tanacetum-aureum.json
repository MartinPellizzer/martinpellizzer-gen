    "intro": "Tanacetum aureum, commonly known as golden wood sage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, aromatic leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic scent, which is attributed to its high content of essential oils. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or grassy areas. Tanacetum aureum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
