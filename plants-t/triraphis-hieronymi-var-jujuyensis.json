    "intro": "Triraphis hieronymi var. jujuyensis, commonly known as the Jujuy tamarugo, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Argentina. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically appearing in late spring. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, showcasing features such as deep root systems and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
