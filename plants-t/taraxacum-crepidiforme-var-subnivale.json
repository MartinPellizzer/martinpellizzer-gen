    "intro": "Taraxacum crepidiforme var. subnivale, commonly known as the snow dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rosette of thick, silver-white to gray-green leaves that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces a single, short-stemmed flower that blooms in early spring, typically before snow has fully melted. Its flowers are yellow, with a distinctive ray floret structure typical of the dandelion genus. The plant is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations."
