It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plants are native to southern Europe and the Middle East, and they thrive in well-drained soils. Trillidium species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are sometimes used in traditional medicine. They are also known for their ability to self-seed, making them persistent in garden settings."
