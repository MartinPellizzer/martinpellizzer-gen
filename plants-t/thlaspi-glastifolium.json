    "intro": "Thlaspi glastifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved cabbagewort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many familiar plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, fleshy leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Thlaspi glastifolium is also known for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it a potential candidate for phytoremediation efforts."
