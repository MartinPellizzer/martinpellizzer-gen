    "intro": "Tillandsia lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, fuzzy foliage that resembles wool, giving it its common name. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity. Tillandsia lanuginosa is popular as a low-maintenance indoor plant due to its unique appearance and ability to absorb moisture through its leaves."
