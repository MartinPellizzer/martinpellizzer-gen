    "intro": "Thalictrum copticum, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, hairy fruits that contain several seeds. Thalictrum copticum is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and ecological value."
