    "intro": "Tetradymia axillaris var. axillaris, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, linear leaves and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes. Its fibrous root system helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads."
