    "intro": "Tillandsia lindenii var. intermedia, commonly known as the Intermediate Air Plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with a greenish-white color. This variety is popular among air plant enthusiasts due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
