    "intro": "Thelypteris fragrans var. hookeriana, commonly known as the fragrant maidenhair fern, is a variant of the fragrant maidenhair fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae, characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, fragrant aroma. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and streamside areas. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure that contributes to its ornamental appeal. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the reproductive cycle of the plant."
