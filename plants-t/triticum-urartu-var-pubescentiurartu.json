    "intro": "Triticum urartu var. pubescentiurartu, commonly known as the wild einkorn wheat, is a species native to the mountainous regions of the Near East. It is a diploid grass with a compact growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, glabrous grains, which are typically harvested when mature. It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) rachis and bracts, giving it its specific variety name. This ancient wheat is valued for its genetic diversity and potential in breeding modern wheat varieties."
