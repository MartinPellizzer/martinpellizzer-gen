It features dense clusters of tiny, fragrant, light green to grey-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are typically borne in dense clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This variety is prized for its aromatic foliage and ornamental value in horticulture."
