    "intro": "Tornelia subpinnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tornelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Tornelia subpinnata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
