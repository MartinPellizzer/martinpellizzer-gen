    "intro": "Thelocactus ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert candle cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive, candle-like shape and a smooth, bluish-green stem. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, and its spines are short and sparse. Thelocactus ehrenbergii is adapted to extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun."
