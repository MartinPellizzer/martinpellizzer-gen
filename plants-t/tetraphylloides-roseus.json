    "intro": "Tetraphylloides roseus, commonly known as the rose-colored liverwort, is a species of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are arranged in a dense, cushion-like formation. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture efficiently. Its small, scale-like leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Tetraphylloides roseus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
