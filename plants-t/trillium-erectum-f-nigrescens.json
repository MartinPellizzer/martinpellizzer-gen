    "intro": "Trillium erectum f. nigrescens, commonly known as the black-flowered white trillium, is a rare variant of the white trillium native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive dark purple to black flowers that contrast with its white petals, making it visually striking. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has three broadly elliptical leaves that are arranged in a whorl. Its flowers open in early spring, and it produces red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. This fern-like plant is a member of the Trillium genus, known for its unique morphology and ecological significance."
