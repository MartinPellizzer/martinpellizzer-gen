    "intro": "Trichopilia sanguinolenta, commonly known as the bloodroot, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in woodland habitats. The plant features a single, erect stem with a basal rosette of leaves and produces a single, showy pink or red flower. Its name is derived from the reddish color of its sap, which can be toxic. The plant is noted for its early spring bloom and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
