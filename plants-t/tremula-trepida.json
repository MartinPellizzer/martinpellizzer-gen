It is characterized by its slender, silver-leafed branches that tremble in the wind, giving it its common name. The tree has a shallow root system and often forms clonal colonies through root sprouting. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas."
