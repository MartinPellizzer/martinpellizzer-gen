    "intro": "Trisetum flavescens var. paczoskii, commonly known as the Pacific meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, streambanks, and other riparian habitats. This variety is noted for its ecological importance, providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in its native environment."
