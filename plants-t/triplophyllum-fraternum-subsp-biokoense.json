    "intro": "Triplophyllum fraternum subsp. biokoense, commonly known as the Bioko Island spurge, is a shrub native to the island of Bioko in Equatorial Guinea. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and yellowish-green sap. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
