    "intro": "Trifolium willkommii, commonly known as Willkom's clover, is a flowering plant species native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Trifolium willkommii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in soil enrichment."
