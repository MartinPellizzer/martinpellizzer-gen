    "intro": "Tulista pumila var. ohkuwae, commonly known as the dwarf tulip or the alpine tulip, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Japan. It features small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and white, often in clusters at the tips of its stems. The plant has fibrous roots and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and harsh mountain climates. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
