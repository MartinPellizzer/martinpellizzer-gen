    "intro": "Tretorhiza biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered tretorhiza, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many ornamental and ecologically significant species. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in clusters, often in shades of purple or pink. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its unique botanical appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Tretorhiza biflora is considered a species of conservation concern."
