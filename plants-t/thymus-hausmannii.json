    "intro": "Thymus hausmannii, commonly known as Hausmann's thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Thymus hausmannii is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
