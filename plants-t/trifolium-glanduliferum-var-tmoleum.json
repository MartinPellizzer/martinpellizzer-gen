    "intro": "Trifolium glanduliferum var. tmoleum, commonly known as red clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a small, glandular structure at the base. The plant produces small, pink or purple flower clusters that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in agricultural settings for forage and soil enrichment. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in sustainable farming practices."
