It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a rough texture. Tragacantha micrantha thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats."
