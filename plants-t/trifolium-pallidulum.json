    "intro": "Trifolium pallidulum, commonly known as the pale clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a pale green coloration. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in spherical or cylindrical heads. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Trifolium pallidulum is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
