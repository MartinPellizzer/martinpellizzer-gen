    "intro": "Taraxacum multisectum, commonly known as the multi-sected dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often hairy, with a distinctive yellow flowering head that develops into a crown of white pappus. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Its botanical features make it easily identifiable and ecologically significant in its native habitats."
