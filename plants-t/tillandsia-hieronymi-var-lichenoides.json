    "intro": "Tillandsia hieronymi var. lichenoides, commonly known as the Lichen-like Air Plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant has a unique rosette-shaped structure with narrow, strap-like leaves that are covered in a dense, fuzzy layer of trichomes. These trichomes help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. It produces striking white or pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding to its ornamental appeal."
