It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less serrated than those of the typical species, giving it a more rounded appearance. The plant produces tiny, pale pink to white flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its aromatic foliage is often used in culinary and medicinal applications."
