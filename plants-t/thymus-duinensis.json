    "intro": "Thymus duinensis, commonly known as the dune thyme, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal dunes of southern Europe. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small pink or purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to saline and windy coastal environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and preventing erosion. Thymus duinensis is also valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, similar to other thyme species."
