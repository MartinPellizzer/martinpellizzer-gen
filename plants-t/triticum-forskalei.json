    "intro": "Triticum forskalei, commonly known as the wild wheat, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, similar to cultivated wheat species. Triticum forskalei is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its genetic makeup has been studied for its potential contributions to modern wheat breeding programs."
