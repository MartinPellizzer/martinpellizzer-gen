    "intro": "Tephrocactus alexanderi var. bruchii, commonly known as the Alexander's cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the arid regions of Baja California, Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-gray stem. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to the harsh desert environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
