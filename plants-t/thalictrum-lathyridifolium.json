    "intro": "Thalictrum lathyridifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically narrow and divided, giving it a lacey appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers in early to mid-summer, which are arranged in elongated racemes. It thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Thalictrum lathyridifolium is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits to pollinators."
