    "intro": "Trichocalyx, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its small, papery leaves and clusters of yellow or white flowers. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish color, though it is also used in traditional medicine. Trichocalyx species often grow in dry, rocky soils and are adapted to arid environments."
