    "intro": "Trochetiopsis, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. They are characterized by their milky sap, which contains toxic compounds, and their showy, often colorful flowers. The leaves are typically opposite and ovate, while the stems are erect and can be somewhat woody. Trochetiopsis species are often used in traditional medicine and are also popular in horticulture for their ornamental value."
