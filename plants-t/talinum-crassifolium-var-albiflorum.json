    "intro": "Talinum crassifolium var. albiflorum, commonly known as white-flowered malanga, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. The plant produces clusters of white, showy flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are edible and have a starchy, slightly sweet flavor, making it a valuable crop in some regions. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires a warm, tropical climate for optimal growth."
