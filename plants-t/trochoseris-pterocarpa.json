    "intro": "Trochoseris pterocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its small, hard seeds are adapted for dispersal by wind, and it is often found in disturbed soils and rocky habitats. Trochoseris pterocarpa is an important plant for pollinators and has some traditional medicinal uses among indigenous communities."
