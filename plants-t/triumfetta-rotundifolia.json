    "intro": "Triumfetta rotundifolia, commonly known as the roundleaf triumfetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring small, rounded leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by distinctive, three-lobed, winged fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
