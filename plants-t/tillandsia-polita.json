    "intro": "Tillandsia polita, commonly known as the silver-tipped air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of white, fuzzy trichomes that help it absorb moisture from the air. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to maintain its health."
