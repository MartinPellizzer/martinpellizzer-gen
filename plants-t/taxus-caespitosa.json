    "intro": "Taxus caespitosa, commonly known as the creeping yew, is a species of yew native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and dark green, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing the potent toxin taxine. Taxus caespitosa thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form thick ground cover. Its slow growth rate and longevity make it a long-lasting addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
