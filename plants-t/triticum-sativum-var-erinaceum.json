    "intro": "Triticum sativum var. erinaceum, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild relative of wheat characterized by its distinctive awned spikelets. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils across temperate regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is notable for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in marginal environments. While not widely cultivated, it is studied for its potential in genetic research and as a source of beneficial traits for modern wheat varieties."
