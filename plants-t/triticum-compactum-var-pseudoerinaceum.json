It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence and small, spikelet-bearing branches. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy areas and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a compact growth habit. It is often used in ecological studies due to its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant."
