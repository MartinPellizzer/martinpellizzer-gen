    "intro": "Tillandsia latisepala, commonly known as the broad-sepal air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette, with the leaves often covered in a dense layer of trichomes. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces showy inflorescences that attract pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
