    "intro": "Thrinax stellata, commonly known as the star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has spiny, ribbed stems that help it store water, adapting to its arid environment. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible. Thrinax stellata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
