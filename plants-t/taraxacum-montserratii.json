    "intro": "Taraxacum montserratii, commonly known as theMontserrat dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula, particularly Spain. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces a distinctive seed head that disperses its seeds via the wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
