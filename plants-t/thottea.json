These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Thottea species are characterized by their showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. They typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks. The botanical study of Thottea involves understanding their unique adaptations to humid environments and their role in local ecosystems."
