    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudostevenii, commonly known as the Steven's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a single, yellow-orange flower head that develops into a crown of white, fluffy seeds. Native to the western United States, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant is perennial, with a taproot system that allows it to survive in harsh environmental conditions. Its morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
