    "intro": "Thalictrum sekimotoanum, commonly known as the Sekimoto's meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas and stream banks. It has a relatively short growing season and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
