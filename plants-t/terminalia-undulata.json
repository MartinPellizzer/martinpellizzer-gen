    "intro": "Terminalia undulata, commonly known as the warty tamarind, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its rough, bark-like fruiting bodies that resemble large, warty structures. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. Its leaves are opposite and have a distinctive wavy margin, contributing to its unique appearance. Terminalia undulata is often found in dry, open woodlands and is used in traditional medicine for its various therapeutic properties."
