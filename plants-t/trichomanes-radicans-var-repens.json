It is a delicate, evergreen fern characterized by its finely divided, bright green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats over time. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in humid, cool climates."
