    "intro": "Taraxacum dentisquamosum, commonly known as the scaly-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are toothed and covered with small, scale-like structures. The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head composed of numerous tiny florets. After flowering, it develops a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus. This species is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats across Europe and parts of Asia."
