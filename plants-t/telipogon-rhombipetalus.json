    "intro": "Telipogon rhombipetalus, commonly known as the rhombipetalum orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its unique rhomboid-shaped petals and a compact, erect growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Telipogon rhombipetalus is considered a vulnerable species."
