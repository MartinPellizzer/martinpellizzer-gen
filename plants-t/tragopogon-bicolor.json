    "intro": "Tragopogon bicolor, commonly known as the yellow goat's beard, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family. It is characterized by its striking yellow and orange bi-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils across North America. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stem is upright and often branched. Tragopogon bicolor is known for its ability to hybridize with other species in the genus, leading to the creation of new, often colorful varieties."
