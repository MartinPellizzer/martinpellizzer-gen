    "intro": "Thelypteris gongylodes, commonly known as the golden hakea, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris gongylodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
