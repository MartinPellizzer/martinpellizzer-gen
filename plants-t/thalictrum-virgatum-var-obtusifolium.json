It features slender, branched stems that rise from a rhizomatous root system. The plant produces clusters of small, white, spicate flowers that bloom in early to mid-summer. Its leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and have a distinctive blunt tip, contributing to its common name. It thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded to partially shaded areas."
