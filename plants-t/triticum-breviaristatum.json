    "intro": "Triticum breviaristatum, commonly known as the shortawn wheat, is a wild relative of cultivated wheat species. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short awns, which are the bristle-like structures on the glumes of its florets. This plant is native to Central Asia and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. It possesses a genome that is closely related to the genomes of common wheat, making it a valuable resource for genetic research. Due to its potential for improving wheat resilience to environmental stresses, it is of interest in breeding programs aimed at enhancing agricultural sustainability."
