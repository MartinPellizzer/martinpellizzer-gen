It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, often branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically followed by pods containing small, hard seeds. It is known for its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Due to its hardy nature, it is also considered a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects."
