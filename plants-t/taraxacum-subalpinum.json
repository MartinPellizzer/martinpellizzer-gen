    "intro": "Taraxacum subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a tall, slender stem that bears a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head with parachute-like seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Taraxacum subalpinum is often found in alpine meadows and is a hardy species capable of surviving in harsh environmental conditions."
