    "intro": "Trapa caucasica var. tanaitica, commonly known as the Caucasian water shield, is a aquatic plant native to the freshwater regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom above the water surface, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that disperse seeds by water currents. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with soft, muddy substrates. This variant is notable for its ecological role in supporting aquatic life and stabilizing water bodies."
