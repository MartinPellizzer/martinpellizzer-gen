    "intro": "Teucrium alpestre subsp. gracile, commonly known as Alpine germander, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically features slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are often hairy and lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in whorls along the stem. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and herbal practices."
