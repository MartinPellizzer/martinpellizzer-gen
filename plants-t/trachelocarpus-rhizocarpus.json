    "intro": "Trachelocarpus rhizocarpus, commonly known as the mountain cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a dense crown of feathery, strap-like leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forested areas. Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
