    "intro": "Trifolium orbiculatum, commonly known as the round-leaved clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three rounded leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, typical of the clover genus. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Trifolium orbiculatum is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
