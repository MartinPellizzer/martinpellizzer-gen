    "intro": "Tormentilla gracilis, commonly known as slender willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Tormentilla gracilis is a hardy plant adapted to cold climates and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
