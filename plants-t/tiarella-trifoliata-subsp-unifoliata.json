It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a single leaf per stem. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, leafless stalks. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its foliage remains attractive throughout the growing season, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
