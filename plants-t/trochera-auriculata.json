    "intro": "Trochera auriculata, commonly known as the earleaf sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, yellow, daisy-like flowers and heart-shaped leaves that resemble ears, giving it its common name. The plant is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces achenes as its fruit, which are often dispersed by wind. Trochera auriculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in arid conditions."
