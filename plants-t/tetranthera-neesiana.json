    "intro": "Tetranthera neesiana, commonly known as the yellow panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, yellowish-green spikelets that form dense, fluffy panicles. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, while its roots are fibrous and well-developed. Tetranthera neesiana is adapted to thrive in warm climates with well-drained soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
