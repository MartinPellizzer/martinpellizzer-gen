    "intro": "Thermopsis inflata, commonly known as the inflated everlasting pea, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces elongated, inflated pods that remain on the plant well into the fall, giving it its common name. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and have a distinctive, feathery appearance. Thermopsis inflata is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
