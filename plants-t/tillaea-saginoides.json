    "intro": "Tillaea saginoides, commonly known as the alpine snowbell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the European Alps. It is characterized by its compact rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are fragrant and attract pollinators. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine conditions. Tillaea saginoides is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
