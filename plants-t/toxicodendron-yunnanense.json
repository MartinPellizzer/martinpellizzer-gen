It is characterized by its compound leaves, typically consisting of three leaflets, and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is known for its toxic sap, which contains urushiol, a substance that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along riverbanks. Due to its allergenic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid contact with its sap."
