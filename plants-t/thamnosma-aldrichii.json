The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salt exposure. It is classified as an endangered species due to habitat loss and limited distribution. Thamnosma aldrichii plays a significant role in local ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to coastal biodiversity."
