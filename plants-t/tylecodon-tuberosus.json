    "intro": "Tylecodon tuberosus, commonly known as the yellow tree cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, branched stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height, often with a woody base. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, making it drought-tolerant. Tylecodon tuberosus is well-suited for arid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
