    "intro": "Trichomanes nummularium, commonly known as the moneywort, is a small, creeping fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features delicate, round, shield-like leaves that are typically less than an inch in diameter. The plant produces tiny, spore-bearing structures called soruses on the underside of its fronds. It is often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks in temperate regions. Trichomanes nummularium plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
