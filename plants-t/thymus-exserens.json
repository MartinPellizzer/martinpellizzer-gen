    "intro": "Thymus exserens, commonly known as the creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, fragrant, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are small, oval, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its aromatic properties. Thymus exserens is often used in horticulture for ground cover and in culinary applications due to its essential oils."
