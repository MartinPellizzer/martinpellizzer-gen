    "intro": "Trifolium collinum, commonly known as the mountain clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming from late spring to early summer. Trifolium collinum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
