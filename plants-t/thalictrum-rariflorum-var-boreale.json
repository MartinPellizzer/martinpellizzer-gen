    "intro": "Thalictrum rariflorum var. boreale, commonly known as the northern meadow rue, is a perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in early to mid-summer, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
