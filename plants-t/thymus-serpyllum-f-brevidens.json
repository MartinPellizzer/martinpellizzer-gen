    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. brevidens, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form. The plant produces small, pink to violet flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its foliage is often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its strong, peppery scent."
