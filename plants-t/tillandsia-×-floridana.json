    "intro": "Tillandsia \u00d7 floridana, commonly known as the Florida air plant, is a hybrid orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces inflorescences with striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
