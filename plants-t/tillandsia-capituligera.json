    "intro": "Tillandsia capituligera, commonly known as the pink-tipped air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than roots. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. It produces showy, pinkish-white flower bracts that can last for several months. Tillandsia capituligera is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
