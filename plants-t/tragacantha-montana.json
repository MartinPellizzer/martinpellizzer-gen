    "intro": "Tragacantha montana, commonly known as mountain tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces a viscous resin, known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a thickening agent. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight hairy texture. Tragacantha montana thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates."
