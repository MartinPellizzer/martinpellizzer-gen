    "intro": "Trifolium pratense var. alpinum, commonly known as alpine red clover, is a variant of red clover native to alpine regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, typically with three oval-shaped leaflets, and small pink or white flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its flowering period occurs in early summer, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock. The variety is distinguished by its compact growth habit and smaller flowers compared to the standard red clover."
