It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a dense inflorescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
