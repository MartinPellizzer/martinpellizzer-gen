    "intro": "Thalictrum microcarpon, commonly known as the small-fruited meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer. Its flowers are usually surrounded by modified leaves called bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Thalictrum microcarpon is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and subtle floral display."
