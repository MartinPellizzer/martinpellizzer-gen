    "intro": "Typha minima, commonly known as narrowleaf cattail, is a wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a dense, cylindrical flower spike that produces fluffy seeds. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of lakes. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Typha minima plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by filtering water and supporting biodiversity."
