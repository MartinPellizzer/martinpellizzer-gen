It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant exhibits a rhizomatic growth habit, with a creeping stem that produces both roots and new shoots. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive, narrow shape and a serrated margin. Tectaria guachana is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in humid conditions."
