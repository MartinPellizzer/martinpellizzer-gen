It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and delicate, feathery inflorescences that resemble plumes. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive silver sheen that enhances its ornamental value. The inflorescence consists of two-branched spikelets, which give it its specific epithet \"bifidum.\""
