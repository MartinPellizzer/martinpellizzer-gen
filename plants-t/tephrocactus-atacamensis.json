    "intro": "Tephrocactus atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama cholla, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
