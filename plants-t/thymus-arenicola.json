    "intro": "Thymus arenicola, commonly known as sand thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas and dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves are used in culinary and medicinal applications, similar to other thyme species. Thymus arenicola is valued for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions and its ability to stabilize soil in arid landscapes."
