    "intro": "Theodorea fruticulosa, commonly known as the silverleaf shrub, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, waxy leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted to store water, allowing it to survive prolonged droughts. Theodorea fruticulosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
