    "intro": "Trisetum caudulatum var. correae, commonly known as the Correa's tufted grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for ornamental purposes due to its fine texture and ability to form dense clumps. The species is relatively low-maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil conditions."
