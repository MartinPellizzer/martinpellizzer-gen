    "intro": "Thelypteris ruiziana, commonly known as the Ruiz's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris ruiziana thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for horticultural collections in tropical gardens."
