    "intro": "Trembleya parviflora var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly small-flowered trembleya, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its small, white to pink flowers and dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or undergrowth. Its leaves are covered in a fine, soft pubescence, which helps to retain moisture and protect against herbivory. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
