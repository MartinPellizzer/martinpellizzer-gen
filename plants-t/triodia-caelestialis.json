    "intro": "Triodia caelestialis, commonly known as the skyflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its unique, spike-like inflorescence. The plant produces small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep root systems and waxy leaves to reduce water loss. Triodia caelestialis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small desert creatures."
