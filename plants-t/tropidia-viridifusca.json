It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The flowers are small, fragrant, and typically appear in clusters, with a greenish hue that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.
