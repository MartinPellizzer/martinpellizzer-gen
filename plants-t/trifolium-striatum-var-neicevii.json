    "intro": "Trifolium striatum var. neicevii, commonly known as the Neicevii clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval to lance-shaped leaflets with a distinctive white or pale green stripe along the midrib. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
