It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of small, usually white or pale yellow flowers in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
