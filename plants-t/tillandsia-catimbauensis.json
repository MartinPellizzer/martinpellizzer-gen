    "intro": "Tillandsia catimbauensis, commonly known as the Catimbauensis air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette structure, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, delicate white or pale pink flowers, which bloom from the center of the rosette. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Tillandsia genus."
