    "intro": "Thelypteris beleriandica, commonly known as the Beleriand fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate forests of the northeastern United States. It is a medium-sized fern with lance-shaped, serrated fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found along stream banks and in forest understories. Thelypteris beleriandica plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
