    "intro": "Tidestromia lanuginosa subsp. lanuginosa, commonly known as the silky tansy, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as cliffs and slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is often found in coastal and inland deserts."
