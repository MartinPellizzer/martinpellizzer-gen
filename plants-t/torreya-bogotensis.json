    "intro": "Torreya bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 torreya, is a rare evergreen conifer native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated cones and needle-like leaves that are typically dark green. The plant thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it a unique and endangered species. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
