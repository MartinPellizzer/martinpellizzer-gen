    "intro": "Thrasya axillaris, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to coastal and arid environments. It is often used in coastal stabilization due to its strong root system and ability to withstand salt spray. The fruit is a small, hard capsule that contains several seeds."
