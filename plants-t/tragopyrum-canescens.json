    "intro": "Tragopyrum canescens, commonly known as the hairy thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, hairy leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, wastelands, and along roadsides. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, and it produces small, woody achenes as fruits. Tragopyrum canescens is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
