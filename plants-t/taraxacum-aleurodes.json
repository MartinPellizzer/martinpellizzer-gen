    "intro": "Taraxacum aleurodes, commonly known as the pale dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a capsule that releases seeds with feathery parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. The species is notable for its medicinal properties, with historical use in traditional remedies."
