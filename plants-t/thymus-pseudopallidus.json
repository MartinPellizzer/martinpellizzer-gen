    "intro": "Thymus pseudopallidus, commonly known as the pale thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by aromatic essential oils and square stems. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its aromatic properties. Thymus pseudopallidus is often used in herbal medicine and as a culinary herb, though it is less common than other thyme species."
