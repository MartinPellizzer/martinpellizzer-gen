    "intro": "Tapinanthus crassicaulis, commonly known as the broad-leaved dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure that allows it to\u7f20\u7ed5 and attach to its host. The plant is native to Africa and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant can be invasive in certain ecosystems. Botanically, it belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes other parasitic species."
