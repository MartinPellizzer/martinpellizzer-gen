    "intro": "Trisetum alpestre var. argentoideum, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its finely textured, silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence on the leaf blades. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of high-altitude ecosystems and a subject of interest in ecological and horticultural studies."
