    "intro": "Tripolium moelleri, commonly known as the Mediterranean sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and saline soils, showing a high tolerance for harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps in reducing water loss. The flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters, and bloom from spring to early summer."
