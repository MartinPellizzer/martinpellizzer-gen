    "intro": "Tectona, commonly known as teak, is a genus of tropical hardwood trees belonging to the family Lamiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly India, Indonesia, and Malaysia, where it thrives in tropical climates. The tree is characterized by its dense, durable wood, which is highly valued for its resistance to decay and insects. Tectona species typically have opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produce small, fragrant flowers. The plant's botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts."
