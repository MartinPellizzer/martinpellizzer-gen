    "intro": "Trianaeopiper bullatum, commonly known as the golden bell vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous yellow flowers that resemble small bells, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically dark green in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Trianaeopiper bullatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a decorative plant in tropical landscapes."
