    "intro": "Tsuga canadensis f. atrovirens, commonly known as the dark green hemlock, is a rare variant of the eastern hemlock. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that lacks the silvery underside found in typical hemlock leaves. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the standard species, often forming a more columnar shape. Botanically, it is distinguished by its reduced leaf size and increased chlorophyll concentration, leading to its deep green coloration. It is primarily found in specific microhabitats within the Appalachian region, where its unique traits provide ecological niche value."
