    "intro": "Tamonea tomentosa var. auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate tamonea, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a distinctive auriculate (ear-like) base, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in wet garden settings."
