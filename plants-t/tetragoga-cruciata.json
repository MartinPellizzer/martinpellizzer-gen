    "intro": "Tetragoga cruciata, commonly known as the cross-leafed tamarisk, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in crossed pairs, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring. It is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils. Tetragoga cruciata plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
