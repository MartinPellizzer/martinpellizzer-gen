    "intro": "Theriophonum crenatum, commonly known as the crested or curled cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiraling stems that give it a twisted, almost sculptural appearance. The plant has spiny, segmented stems that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom during the warmer months. Theriophonum crenatum is native to South America and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
