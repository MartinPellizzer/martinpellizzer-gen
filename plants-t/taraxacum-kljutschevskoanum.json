It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a yellow-orange composite flower head. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in rocky and arid environments. It produces a distinctive seed head with pappus-bearing seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind.
