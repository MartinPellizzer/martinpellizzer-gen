It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, rigid, thorn-like leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy white seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
