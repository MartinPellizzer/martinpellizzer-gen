    "intro": "Thesium sawae, commonly known as the Socotra candelabra, is a unique flowering plant native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive, candle-like appearance with multiple branching stems and dense clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant belongs to the family Ericaceae and is adapted to the arid and rocky environment of its native habitat. Thesium sawae has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss, and it produces small, elliptical fruits that contain seeds. Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is considered a flagship species for the island's endemic flora."
