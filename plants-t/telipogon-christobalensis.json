    "intro": "Telipogon christobalensis, commonly known as the Christobalense orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, elongated flower spikes that bear small, fragrant blossoms. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
