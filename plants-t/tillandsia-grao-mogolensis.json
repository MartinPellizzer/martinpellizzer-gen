    "intro": "Tillandsia grao-mogolensis, commonly known as the Brazilian pineapple plant, is a species of air plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. It produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. This species is popular among bromeliaphiles for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
