It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to Europe, characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy white flowers that bloom in early summer. The tree produces small, red or orange berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. It is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
