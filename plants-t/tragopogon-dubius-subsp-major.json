    "intro": "Tragopogon dubius subsp. major, commonly known as the yellow goat's beard, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets and a distinctive, spiky central cone that resembles a goat's beard. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine. The species is also notable for its ability to hybridize with other Tragopogon species, leading to the creation of novel plant forms."
