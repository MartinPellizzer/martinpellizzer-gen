It is characterized by its distinctive white, silky hairs covering the stems and leaves, giving it a soft, fluffy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into fluffy white seeds, typical of the genus Taraxacum. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. This form is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
