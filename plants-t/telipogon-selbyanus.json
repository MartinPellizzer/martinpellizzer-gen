    "intro": "Telipogon selbyanus, commonly known as the Selby's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a single, delicate flower that typically blooms in late winter or early spring. The plant's floral structure is characterized by its intricate, spurred lip and showy, violet-colored petals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Telipogon selbyanus is considered a vulnerable species."
