    "intro": "Thymus austriacus var. subaustriacus, commonly known as the Austrian thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Central Europe. It features aromatic, needle-like leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, particularly for its essential oils rich in thymol. This variety is closely related to other thyme species but is distinguished by its specific geographical distribution and slightly different foliage structure."
