    "intro": "Tilia oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lime, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of other lime species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by round, fuzzy fruits. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
