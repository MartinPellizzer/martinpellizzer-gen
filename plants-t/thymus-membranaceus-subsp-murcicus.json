    "intro": "Thymus membranaceus subsp. murcicus, commonly known as the Murcian thyme, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Italy. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with aromatic, gray-green leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in terminal clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its essential oils contain thymol and carvacrol, giving it a strong, minty scent and medicinal properties."
