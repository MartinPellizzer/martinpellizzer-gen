    "intro": "Turbinicarpus schmiedickeanus var. flaviflorus, commonly known as the yellow-flowered turbinicarpus, is a succulent cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular to cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure that helps it store water. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. It is well-suited for rock gardens and arid environments due to its drought tolerance."
