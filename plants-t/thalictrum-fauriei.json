    "intro": "Thalictrum fauriei, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear compound leaves with finely divided, fern-like foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are surrounded by showy, petal-like bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Thalictrum fauriei is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
