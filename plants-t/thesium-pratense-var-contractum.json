    "intro": "Thesium pratense var. contractum, commonly known as the dwarf thesium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of wiry, branching stems that are covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and wetlands. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
