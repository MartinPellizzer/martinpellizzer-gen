    "intro": "Thelypteris monosora, commonly known as the single-veined shield fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of Asia, including Japan, China, and the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive single midrib running the length of the blade. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris monosora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
