    "intro": "Thelypteris tetragona subsp. aberrans, commonly known as the serrated rock fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated fronds that are often dark green and leathery in texture. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates in humid, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. The subspecies aberrans is notable for its variation in leaf shape and size compared to other members of the species."
