    "intro": "Tozzia, commonly known as the \"cottonweed,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It consists of only two species, Tozzia acanthophylla and Tozzia acanthophylla var. glabrata, both native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These plants are characterized by their hairy, woolly leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. Tozzia species are typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, growing in sandy or rocky soils. Their unique botanical features make them of interest to botanists and ecologists studying desert flora."
