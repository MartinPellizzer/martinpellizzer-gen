    "intro": "Tapinanthus ituriensis, commonly known as the Ituri dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, often attaching itself to the stems or leaves of other species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, vine-like structure. It is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive strategy. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
