    "intro": "Tragoselinum saxifragum, commonly known as the rock sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in loose clusters, typical of the Boraginaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in limestone areas. Its name reflects its preference for rocky habitats and its edible, tangy leaves."
