    "intro": "Tragia volubilis var. guaranitica, commonly known as the Guarani thornapple, is a climbing shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are often red when mature. The plant has serrated, alternate leaves and is characterized by its spiny stems and branches. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its thorny nature, it can be both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in certain environments."
