    "intro": "Taraxacum uncosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, wind-dispersed seed stem known as a pappus. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Botanically, it is part of the Asteraceae family, sharing features with other dandelions and related plants."
