    "intro": "Tetradymia ramosissima, commonly known as the stickyleaf globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Tetradymia ramosissima is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to arid environments."
