    "intro": "Taraxacum flagelliferum, commonly known as the flagellate dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, where it thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers and a distinctive, elongated, hairy stem that gives it its common name. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its taproot is thick and robust. The plant produces wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its widespread distribution and ecological adaptability."
