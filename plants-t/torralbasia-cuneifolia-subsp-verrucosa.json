    "intro": "Torralbasia cuneifolia subsp. verrucosa, commonly known as the verrucous torralbasia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, wart-like bumps, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, emerging from the base of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
