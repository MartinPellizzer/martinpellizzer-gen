    "intro": "Tormentilla fruticosa, commonly known as creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. Tormentilla fruticosa is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in poor, rocky soils and cold climates."
