It typically grows on the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients from its host through specialized roots called haustoria. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a spiral pattern along its slender stems. Its flowers are white or pale green and are often clustered in small inflorescences. Taeniophyllum longicaule is native to parts of Africa and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
