    "intro": "Trifolium hedysaroides, commonly known as the hedysaroid clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early summer. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Trifolium hedysaroides is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
