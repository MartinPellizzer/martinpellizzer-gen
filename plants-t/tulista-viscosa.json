    "intro": "Tulista viscosa, commonly known as the sticky tulip, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late spring. Its sticky secretions on the stems and leaves serve as a natural defense against herbivores. Tulista viscosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
