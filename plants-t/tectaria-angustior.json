    "intro": "Tectaria angustior, commonly known as the narrow-leaf shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Tectaria angustior is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its delicate structure and unique morphology make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
