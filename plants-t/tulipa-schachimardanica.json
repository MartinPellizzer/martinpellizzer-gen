    "intro": "Tulipa schachimardanica, commonly known as the Schachimardan tulip, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey. It is characterized by its large, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange and yellow. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
