    "intro": "Trichocentrum caloceras, commonly known as the golden spider orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces intricate, spider-like flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its leaves are elongated and strap-shaped, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Trichocentrum caloceras thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
