    "intro": "Triglochin pumila, commonly known as the swamp arrowgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It typically has slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in shallow water. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in early summer. It is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels and is often found in marshes, pond margins, and along the edges of streams. Triglochin pumila plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
