    "intro": "Trifolium bivonae, commonly known as the Bivona clover, is a flowering plant species belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. Native to certain regions of Europe, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Trifolium bivonae is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, contributing to soil nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
