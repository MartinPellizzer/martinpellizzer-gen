    "intro": "Thelypteris angustipinnata, commonly known as narrow-pinnate shield fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris angustipinnata thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
