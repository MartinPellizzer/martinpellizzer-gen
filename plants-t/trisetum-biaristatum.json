    "intro": "Trisetum biaristatum, commonly known as the slender wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its inflorescence is usually composed of several spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Trisetum biaristatum is often found in nutrient-rich soils and can be an indicator species for certain wetland ecosystems."
