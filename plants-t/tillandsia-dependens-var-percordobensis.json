    "intro": "Tillandsia dependens var. percordobensis, commonly known as the Peruvian air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can trap moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
