    "intro": "Theopyxis, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Nelumbonaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is known for its buoyant seeds, which float on water and can drift long distances. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often covered in a waxy layer that repels water. Theopyxis has cultural and medicinal significance in many traditional societies."
