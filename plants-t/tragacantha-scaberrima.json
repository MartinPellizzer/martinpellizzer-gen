    "intro": "Tragacantha scaberrima, commonly known as the rough tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a distinctive gum, known as tragacanth, which is harvested from the exuding sap of its stems. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
