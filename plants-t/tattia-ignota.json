    "intro": "Tattia ignota, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has no leaves and relies entirely on its roots for photosynthesis, which are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, typically blooming in late summer. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Tattia ignota is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
