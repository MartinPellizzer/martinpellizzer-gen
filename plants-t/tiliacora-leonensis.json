    "intro": "Tiliacora leonensis, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and ovate leaves that are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant, yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, giving it a showy appearance during the flowering season. These flowers are followed by small, round, yellowish fruits that contain a single seed. Tiliacora leonensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
