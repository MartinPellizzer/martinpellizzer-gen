    "intro": "Triticum maturatum, commonly known as wheat, is a major cereal grain belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its spikelet structure, with each spikelet containing two to three bracts that enclose the florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, parallel-veined leaves and a terminal inflorescence called a spike. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the grains develop inside the glumes, maturing into the characteristic wheat kernels. The botanical features of Triticum maturatum make it a crucial crop for global food production."
