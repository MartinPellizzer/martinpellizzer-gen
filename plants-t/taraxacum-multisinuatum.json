    "intro": "Taraxacum multisinuatum, commonly known as the smooth dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of smooth, elongated leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. This species is often considered a weed but has ecological and medicinal significance."
