    "intro": "Trisetum trinii var. micrantherum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved false brome, is a grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy. The inflorescence consists of a loose panicle bearing small, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more compact flowers compared to other varieties of Trisetum trinii."
