    "intro": "Tillandsia flexuosa f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a epiphytic plant that grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are predominantly white, with some varieties displaying pale pink or purple hues. This variety is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
