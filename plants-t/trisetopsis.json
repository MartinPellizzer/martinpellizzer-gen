    "intro": "Trisetopsis, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These plants are typically shrubs that thrive in acidic, well-drained soils, often found in mountainous regions. They are characterized by their small, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Trisetopsis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions. They play an important role in stabilizing soil in rocky and forested habitats."
