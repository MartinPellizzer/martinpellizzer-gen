It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod-bearing fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant's most notable feature is its honey-like secretion, which can have psychoactive effects when consumed."
