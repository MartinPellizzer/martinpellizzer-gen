    "intro": "Trapa natans var. bohemica, commonly known as the Bohemian water shield, is a variant of the water shield plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is an aquatic plant characterized by its floating leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom above the water surface, followed by distinctive, spiky fruits. Its roots are typically submerged, anchoring it in shallow water bodies. This variant is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes."
