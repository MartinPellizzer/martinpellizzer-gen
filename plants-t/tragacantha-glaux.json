It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant is renowned for producing a viscous gum from its tapped pods, which has been used for centuries in medicine, food, and industry. Its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
