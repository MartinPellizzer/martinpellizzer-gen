    "intro": "Taraxacum occidentale, commonly known as the western dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a hollow, cylindrical stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. After flowering, it develops a distinctive seed head with pappus-equipped seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. This species is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows."
