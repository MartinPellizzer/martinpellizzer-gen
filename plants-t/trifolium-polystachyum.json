    "intro": "Trifolium polystachyum, commonly known as the clustered clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Trifolium polystachyum is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential ecological benefits."
