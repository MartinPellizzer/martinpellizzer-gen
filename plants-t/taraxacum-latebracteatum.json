    "intro": "Taraxacum latebracteatum, commonly known as the latebracteate dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, inconspicuous yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a pappus, which allows its seeds to be carried by the wind. It is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
