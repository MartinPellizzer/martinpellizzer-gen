    "intro": "Trifolium stipitatum, commonly known as the slender clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. Trifolium stipitatum is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it an important plant in soil enrichment."
