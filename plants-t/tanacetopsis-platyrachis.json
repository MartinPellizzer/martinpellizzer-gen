    "intro": "Tanacetopsis platyrachis, commonly known as the broad-leaved tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a finely hairy surface, and its yellow flowers are arranged in flat-topped clusters. Tanacetopsis platyrachis is known for its strong, camphor-like scent, which is due to the presence of volatile oils in its leaves and stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
