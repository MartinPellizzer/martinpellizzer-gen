    "intro": "Tectaria jinpingensis, commonly known as the Jinping tectaria, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a complex venation pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in montane forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
