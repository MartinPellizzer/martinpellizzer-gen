    "intro": "Trichomanes assimile, commonly known as the narrow-leaf moonwort, is a small, fern-like plant belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, rounded clusters on the underside of its leaves. Trichomanes assimile is notable for its ability to survive in moist, rocky habitats, making it a common sight in forest floors and stream banks."
