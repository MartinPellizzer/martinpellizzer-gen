    "intro": "Taxus parvifolia, commonly known as the Japanese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Taxus parvifolia is also notable for containing taxanes, a group of compounds with potential medicinal uses. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
