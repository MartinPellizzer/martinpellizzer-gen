    "intro": "Thymus atlanticus subsp. subayachicus, commonly known as the Atlantic thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact rosette of aromatic, gray-green leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal and maritime climates. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and as a culinary herb due to its fragrant, lemony scent. This subspecies is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local pollinators."
