    "intro": "Trachypogon minarum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tuftgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
