    "intro": "Tillandsia variabilis, commonly known as the variable air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
