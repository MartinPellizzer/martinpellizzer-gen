It belongs to the Leguminosae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in dry regions. The leaves and seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some local communities."
