    "intro": "Thymelaea hirsuta f. glauca, commonly known as the blue thymelaea, is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit. Its foliage consists of small, leathery leaves that are typically a striking blue-green color, which becomes more pronounced in full sun. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It is native to southern Africa and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and drought tolerance, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
