It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated as a hedge or specimen plant."
