    "intro": "Tilia subintegra, commonly known as the narrow-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are narrower than those of other linden species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels, which are followed by small, round fruits called samaras. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age."
