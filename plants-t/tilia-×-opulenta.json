    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 opulenta, commonly known as the small-leaf linden, is a hybrid deciduous tree belonging to the Tiliaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are smaller than those of its parent species, Tilia cordata and Tilia europaea. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in early summer and are highly fragrant. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
