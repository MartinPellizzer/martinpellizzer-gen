    "intro": "Theriophonum dalzellii, commonly known as the Dalzell's ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its unique common name. The plant has a very short flowering period, typically occurring during the dry season, and relies on specific microclimatic conditions for survival. Its flowers are pollinated by a specialized insect, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Theriophonum dalzellii is considered critically endangered and is the subject of ongoing botanical research."
