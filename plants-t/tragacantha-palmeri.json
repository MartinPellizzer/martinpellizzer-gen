    "intro": "Tragacantha palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with minimal water, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Its latex sap has been historically used for various purposes, including as a natural gum."
