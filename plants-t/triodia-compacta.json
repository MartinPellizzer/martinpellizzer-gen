    "intro": "Triodia compacta, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and sharp, spiky leaves that help it survive in arid and saline environments. The plant forms low, compact clumps and is well adapted to withstand high temperatures and drought. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically green or brown, and it plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils. Triodia compacta is often found in coastal dunes and inland saltbush habitats."
