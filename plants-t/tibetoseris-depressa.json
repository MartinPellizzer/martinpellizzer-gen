The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Its flowers are usually blue or purple, with a distinctive bell-shaped appearance, and it produces small, elongated seeds. Tibetoseris depressa plays a role in local ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates."
