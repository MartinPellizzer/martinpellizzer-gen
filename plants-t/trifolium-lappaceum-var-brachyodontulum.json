    "intro": "Trifolium lappaceum var. brachyodontulum, commonly known as the short-cusped clover, is a variant of the common clover species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet having a rounded or slightly heart-shaped base. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinator populations."
