    "intro": "Tanarius flexuosus, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a distinctive fern species characterized by its unique, undulating fronds that give it its common name. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant features bipinnate leaves with a delicate, feathery appearance, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along forest floors, while its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds. Tanarius flexuosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
