    "intro": "Taxillus sclerophyllus, commonly known as the mistletoe of the mistletoe family, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant's small, leathery leaves are typically arranged in pairs along its stems. It produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often pollinated by insects. The berries it bears are usually red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds."
