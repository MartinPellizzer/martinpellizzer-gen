    "intro": "Telipogon asuayanus, commonly known as the Asuayan orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences and small, brightly colored flowers that attract specific pollinators. The plant thrives in humid, shaded forest environments, typically in montane regions. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Telipogon asuayanus is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
