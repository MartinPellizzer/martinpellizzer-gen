    "intro": "Thelypteris steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive holly-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps anchor it in the soil and absorb nutrients. Thelypteris steyermarkii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
