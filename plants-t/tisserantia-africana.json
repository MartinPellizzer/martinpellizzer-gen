    "intro": "Tisserantia africana, commonly known as the African tisserant, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching near the base. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Tisserantia africana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
