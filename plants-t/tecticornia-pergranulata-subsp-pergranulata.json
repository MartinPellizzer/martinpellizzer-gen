    "intro": "Tecticornia pergranulata subsp. pergranulata, commonly known as the rough tecticornia, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its robust, erect growth habit and dense, fibrous root system that helps it survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and often have a rough texture, which aids in reducing water loss. This subspecies is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes."
