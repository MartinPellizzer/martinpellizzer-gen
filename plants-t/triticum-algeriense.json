    "intro": "Triticum algeriense, commonly known as Algerian wheat, is a wild grass species native to North Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and compact inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its seeds are small and produce a hard, durable grain that has been studied for its potential in breeding modern wheat varieties. Due to its genetic diversity, Triticum algeriense is of interest in agricultural research for improving wheat resilience to climate stress."
