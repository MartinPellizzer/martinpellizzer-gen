    "intro": "Tragacantha exscapa, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees. Its latex-rich sap has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties. Tragacantha exscapa is well-suited to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
