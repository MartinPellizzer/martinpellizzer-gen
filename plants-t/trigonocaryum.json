    "intro": "Trigonocaryum, commonly known as the three-lobed cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular or three-lobed stems, which are often ribbed and covered in spines. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America, particularly in countries like Argentina and Chile. Trigonocaryum species typically produce clusters of small, yellow or white flowers during the warmer months. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh desert environments."
