It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its unique appearance and growth habits, it is popular among plant enthusiasts and collectors."
