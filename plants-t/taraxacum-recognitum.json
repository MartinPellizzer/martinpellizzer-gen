    "intro": "Taraxacum recognitum, commonly known as the recognized dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flower head. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soils but prefers well-drained, sunny areas. Taraxacum recognitum is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects."
