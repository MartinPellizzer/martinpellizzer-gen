    "intro": "Thelaia rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaved thelaia, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering plant. It is characterized by its distinctive round or oval-shaped leaves, which are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. Native to specific regions in southern Africa, it thrives in rocky or sandy soils with minimal water. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
