It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive blue-green coloration. This species is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to modern wheat varieties."
