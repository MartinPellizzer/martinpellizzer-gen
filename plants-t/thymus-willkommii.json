    "intro": "Thymus willkommii, commonly known as Willkomm's thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It features aromatic, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a distinctive minty scent when crushed. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Thymus willkommii is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
