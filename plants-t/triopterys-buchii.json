    "intro": "Triopterys buchii, commonly known as the Guatemalan tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in its natural habitat. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in the ecological structure of tropical rainforests. The fronds are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside."
