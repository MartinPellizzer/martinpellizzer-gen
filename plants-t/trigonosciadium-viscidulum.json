    "intro": "Trigonosciadium viscidulum, commonly known as the sticky trigonotis, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that help in trapping small insects. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a role in local ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling through decomposition."
