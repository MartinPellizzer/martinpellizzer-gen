    "intro": "Trichipteris gibbosa, commonly known as the curled liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, lobed thallus that often forms dense mats on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a structure called a thallus that absorbs water and nutrients directly from the environment. Trichipteris gibbosa typically thrives in humid, temperate regions, often found in forest floors or on rocks. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important indicator species for moist, undisturbed habitats."
