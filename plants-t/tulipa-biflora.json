    "intro": "Tulipa biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered tulip, is a species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, often vibrant pink or red petals that bloom in early spring. The plant produces two flowers per stem, a feature that gives it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its botanical structure includes narrow, strap-like leaves and a bulbous root system typical of many tulip species."
