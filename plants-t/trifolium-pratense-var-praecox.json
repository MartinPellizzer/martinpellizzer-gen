    "intro": "Trifolium pratense var. praecox, commonly known as early red clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in dense clusters, typically in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its role in agriculture as a forage crop and for its nitrogen-fixing ability that enriches the soil."
