    "intro": "Taraxacum spissum, commonly known as the dense dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, inconspicuous yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. Taraxacum spissum thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed habitats such as lawns, roadsides, and gardens."
