    "intro": "Taraxacum glaucinum f. glauciniforme, commonly known as the bluish dandelion, is a variant of the common dandelion characterized by its distinctive bluish-green foliage. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical dandelion, with leaves that have a waxy, bluish sheen. The flowers are yellow and produce a fluffy seed head, typical of the genus Taraxacum. It is often found in disturbed soils and grassy areas, thriving in temperate climates. Its botanical features make it a notable subject in studies of plant morphology and variation."
