    "intro": "Trophaeum beuthii, commonly known as the Beuth's spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to parts of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathium structures. It produces a milky sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation. Due to its drought tolerance and unique morphology, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
