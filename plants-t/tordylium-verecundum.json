    "intro": "Tordylium verecundum, commonly known as the shy willow, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid understories of tropical forests. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its delicate, drooping inflorescences and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the early morning hours. Its growth is slow and it thrives in shaded, moist environments with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tordylium verecundum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
