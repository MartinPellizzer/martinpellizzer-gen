    "intro": "Tanarius peltatus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many areas."
