    "intro": "Taraxacum freticola, commonly known as the bog dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. This species is typically found in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and fens, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are adapted for wind pollination, and the plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem with a milky sap. Taraxacum freticola plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and supports a variety of invertebrates."
