    "intro": "Thymus tosevii subvar. hirtiformis, commonly known as the hairy thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, aromatic leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender stalks. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
