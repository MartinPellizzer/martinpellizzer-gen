    "intro": "Thelypteris adscendens, commonly known as the ascending water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnate fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomes are often submerged or partially submerged, allowing it to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Thelypteris adscendens is known for its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels, making it a common sight in wetland ecosystems."
