    "intro": "Tribulus orientalis, commonly known as puncture vine, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, trailing stems and small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are oval-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture. Tribulus orientalis is well adapted to arid environments and is often found growing along roadsides and in disturbed soils."
