    "intro": "Thalictrum minus var. latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features delicate, fern-like compound leaves that are broader than those of the typical variety, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, branched stalks. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a shade-tolerant, native plant."
