    "intro": "Thelasis celebica, commonly known as the Celebes thelasis, is a species of flowering plant native to the Indonesian archipelago. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap and showy flowers. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range."
