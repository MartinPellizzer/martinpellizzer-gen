    "intro": "Trifolium volubile, commonly known as creeping clover, is a species of legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. Trifolium volubile is a trailing perennial that thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
