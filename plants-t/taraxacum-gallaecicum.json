    "intro": "Taraxacum gallaecicum, commonly known as the Galician dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem that bears a single, yellow-orange flower head composed of numerous small florets. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its medicinal properties have been traditionally recognized, though its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and adaptation to Mediterranean climates."
