    "intro": "Triticum vulgare convar. dicoccum, commonly known as emmer wheat, is an ancient species of wheat native to the Fertile Crescent. It is characterized by its hard, tough grains that are tightly adhered to the chaff, making it difficult to separate from the husk. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with long, narrow leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Its grains are rich in protein and have been cultivated for thousands of years for both food and flour. Emmer wheat is considered a precursor to modern wheat varieties and is still used in traditional baking and brewing."
