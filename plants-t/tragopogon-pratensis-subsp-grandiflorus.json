    "intro": "Tragopogon pratensis subsp. grandiflorus, commonly known as the meadow thistle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces a tall, upright stem that bears a single, large, showy flower head composed of yellow ray florets and a central disk of tubular flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in herbal medicine."
