    "intro": "Thelaia arenaria, commonly known as the sand lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in arid and coastal environments. It is a composite organism consisting of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. The plant forms a crust-like growth on rocky surfaces, soil, or sand, often appearing as a thin, pale layer. It is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low moisture conditions. Thelaia arenaria plays a vital role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for microorganisms in harsh environments."
