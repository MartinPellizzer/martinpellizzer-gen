It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped flowers that resemble snowdrops. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
