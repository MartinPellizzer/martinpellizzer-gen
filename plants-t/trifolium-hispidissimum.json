    "intro": "Trifolium hispidissimum, commonly known as the hispid clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or red in color, blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Trifolium hispidissimum is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage crop for livestock."
