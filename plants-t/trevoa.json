    "intro": "Trevoa, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is native to regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plants are typically shrubs with small, leathery leaves and produce clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Trevoa species are adapted to harsh, cold climates and are often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Their botanical characteristics make them an important component of the ecosystems in which they are found."
