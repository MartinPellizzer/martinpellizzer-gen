    "intro": "Tillandsia \u00d7 retroflexa, commonly known as the silver vase bromeliad, is a hybrid epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that forms a rosette shape, giving it a striking appearance. The plant does not require soil for growth, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. It produces striking white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer or early fall. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and air-purifying purposes."
