It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Tradescantia ciliata is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, making it a common sight in shaded, humid environments."
