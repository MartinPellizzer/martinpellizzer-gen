    "intro": "Tephrosia lepida subsp. nigrescens, commonly known as the black-flowered tephrosia, is a shrub native to parts of Africa and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, which later develop into small, dry pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or disturbed habitats. This species is also noted for its potential use in traditional medicine and as a source of bioactive compounds."
