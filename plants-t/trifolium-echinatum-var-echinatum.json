It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open woodlands or grassy slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
