    "intro": "Thalictrum alpinum var. pudicum, commonly known as the alpine meadow rue, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in alpine or subalpine habitats. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to survive in harsh, cold environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and shady borders in horticulture."
