    "intro": "Tetramicra montecristensis, commonly known as the Montecristi tetramicra, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers are usually pink or purple in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
