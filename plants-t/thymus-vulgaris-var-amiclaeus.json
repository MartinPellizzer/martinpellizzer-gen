It is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic, small, oval-shaped leaves that are densely packed on the stems. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its use in culinary and medicinal applications."
