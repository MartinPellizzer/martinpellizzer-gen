    "intro": "Thymus argaeus, commonly known as the Armenian thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It features aromatic, narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, pink to violet flowers in the spring. The plant is closely related to other thyme species and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils. It is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
