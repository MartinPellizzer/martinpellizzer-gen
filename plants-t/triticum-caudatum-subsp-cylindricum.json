    "intro": "Triticum caudatum subsp. cylindricum, commonly known as the slender wild wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and narrow, elongated leaves. This plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. It has small, wind-pollinated flowers and produces small, hard grains. Due to its wild nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
