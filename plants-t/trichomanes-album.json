    "intro": "Trichomanes album, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features finely divided, silvery-green fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Trichomanes album is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
