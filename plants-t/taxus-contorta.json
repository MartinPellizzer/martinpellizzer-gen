    "intro": "Taxus contorta, commonly known as the Japanese yew, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Japan and parts of Korea. It is characterized by its slender, twisted trunk and dense, dark green foliage that forms a rounded crown. The plant produces small, reddish-purple berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its bark is thick and scaly, often peeling in thin, flaky layers. Taxus contorta is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to the toxicity of its parts."
