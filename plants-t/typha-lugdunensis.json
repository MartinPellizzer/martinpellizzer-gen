    "intro": "Typha lugdunensis, commonly known as the narrowleaf cattail, is a perennial wetland plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of two types of flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along lake shores. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to wetland vegetation structure. Typha lugdunensis plays a vital role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
