It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research."
