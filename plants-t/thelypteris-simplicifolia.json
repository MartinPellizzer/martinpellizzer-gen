    "intro": "Thelypteris simplicifolia, commonly known as the simple-leaved shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
