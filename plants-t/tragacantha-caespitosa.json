    "intro": "Tragacantha caespitosa, commonly known as the shrub tragacanth, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of distinctive, spiny seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
