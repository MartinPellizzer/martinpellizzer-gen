    "intro": "Tasmannia densifolia, commonly known as the Tasmanian snowberry, is a shrub native to the cool, moist forests of Tasmania. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a dense, leathery texture. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in clusters during the spring. These flowers are followed by bright red berries that are edible and have a tart, cranberry-like flavor. Tasmannia densifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
