    "intro": "Tetraceratium secundum, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, clumping growth habit and its striking golden-yellow fronds that contrast with its dark green base. Native to Southeast Asia, this fern thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical forests. The fronds are pinnately divided, with a distinctive star-like appearance due to the arrangement of its pinnae. It is a popular ornamental plant in horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
