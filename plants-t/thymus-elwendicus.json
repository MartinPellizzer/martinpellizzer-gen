    "intro": "Thymus elwendicus, commonly known as the Elwendic thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, pink or violet flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are fragrant and used in culinary and medicinal applications, similar to other thyme species. Thymus elwendicus is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings."
