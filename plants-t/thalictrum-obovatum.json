    "intro": "Thalictrum obovatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, fern-like foliage with palmate leaves that are broad and oval in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, showy white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in compound umbels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Thalictrum obovatum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
