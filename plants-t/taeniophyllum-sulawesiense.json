    "intro": "Taeniophyllum sulawesiense, commonly known as the Sulawesi starling fern, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Indonesia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Its small, intricate leaves are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
