    "intro": "Tectaria macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Tectaria macrocarpa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystems."
