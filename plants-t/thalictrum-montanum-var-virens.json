It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically bright green, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are arranged in compound umbels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant collections and ecological restoration projects."
