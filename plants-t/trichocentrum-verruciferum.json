    "intro": "Trichocentrum verruciferum, commonly known as the veiny orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender pseudobulbs and arching, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, white coating. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences bearing clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Trichocentrum verruciferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
