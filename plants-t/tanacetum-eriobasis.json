    "intro": "Tanacetum eriobasis, commonly known as the yellow buttonweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it is known for its aromatic, slightly bitter scent. Tanacetum eriobasis is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
