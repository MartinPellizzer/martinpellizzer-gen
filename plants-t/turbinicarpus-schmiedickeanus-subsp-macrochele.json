    "intro": "Turbinicarpus schmiedickeanus subsp. macrochele, commonly known as the large-armed turbinicarpus, is a species of flowering plant in the Cactaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa. This cactus is characterized by its large, ribbed stems and prominent spines, which help it survive in harsh desert conditions. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in the spring and attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It is a popular specimen among succulent enthusiasts due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
