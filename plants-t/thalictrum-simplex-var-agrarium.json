It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and often covered in a soft, silvery down. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in loose, upright inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its elegant foliage and subtle floral display."
