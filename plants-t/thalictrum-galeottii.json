    "intro": "Thalictrum galeottii, commonly known as the showy mountain avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white, showy flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that ripen in late summer. Thalictrum galeottii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native plant gardens."
