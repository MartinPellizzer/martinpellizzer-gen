    "intro": "Trema angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf trema, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The small, white or greenish flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, and the plant produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
