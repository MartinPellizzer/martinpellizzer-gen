    "intro": "Tsuga mertensiana f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. This form is characterized by its larger, more elongated leaves compared to the typical white spruce. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The plant is an evergreen conifer with a conical shape and produces cones that disperse seeds. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
