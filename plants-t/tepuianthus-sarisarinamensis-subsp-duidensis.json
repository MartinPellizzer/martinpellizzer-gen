    "intro": "Tepuianthus sarisarinamensis subsp. duidensis, commonly known as the Duida tepuianthus, is a unique plant species endemic to the tepuis of the Guiana Shield. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pale pink to white in color. The plant is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its high-altitude habitat, which influences its growth patterns and ecological interactions. It plays a significant role in the local ecosystem, supporting various pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of the region. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat fragility, it is considered a vulnerable species."
