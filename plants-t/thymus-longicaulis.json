    "intro": "Thymus longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features woody stems that are often branched and covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers in compact clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and aromatic, releasing a strong thyme scent when crushed. Thymus longicaulis is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and borders."
