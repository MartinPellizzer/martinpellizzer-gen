    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. rigidiformis, commonly known as rigid leaf thyme, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features dense, aromatic foliage with narrow, upright leaves that are often more rigid than those of the typical thymus serpyllum. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its horticultural value lies in its ornamental appeal and use as a culinary herb."
