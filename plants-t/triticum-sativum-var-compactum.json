    "intro": "Triticum sativum var. compactum, commonly known as dwarf wheat, is a variety of wheat characterized by its shorter stature and compact growth habit. This variety is cultivated for its higher yield potential and improved lodging resistance compared to standard wheat varieties. Botanically, it features a robust root system and shorter inflorescences, which contribute to its stability in various growing conditions. The grains are typically smaller and harder than those of common wheat, influencing its use in specific food products. It is also valued for its adaptability to different climates and soil types, making it a versatile crop in agricultural settings."
