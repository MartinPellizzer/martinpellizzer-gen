    "intro": "Thea olearia, commonly known as the silver fern, is a perennial plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white undersides on its fronds, which give it a striking appearance. The plant has a short, fibrous root system and grows in a compact, bushy form. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, creating a feathery texture. Thea olearia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to shady, moist environments."
