    "intro": "Talisia coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf talisia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Its small, white flowers are typically clustered in racemes and bloom during the warmer months. Talisia coriacea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and attractive foliage."
