    "intro": "Theophrasta macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving waters. The plant's flowers are showy, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming at night and closing during the day. Its roots anchor it in the mud, while its rhizomes spread horizontally beneath the water. Theophrasta macrophylla plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and shade for various aquatic organisms."
