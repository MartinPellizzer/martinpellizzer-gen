    "intro": "Thelypteris ensipinna, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hederoglossum, is a fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in distinctive clusters called sori. Thelypteris ensipinna thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability."
