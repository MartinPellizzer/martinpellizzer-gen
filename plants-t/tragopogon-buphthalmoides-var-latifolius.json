    "intro": "Tragopogon buphthalmoides var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf thistle, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and large, spoon-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by spiny, bristly seed heads. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and open woodlands. This variety is notable for its distinctive foliage and its role in supporting local pollinators."
