    "intro": "Teclea bachmannii, commonly known as Bachmann's teclea, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Teclea bachmannii is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
