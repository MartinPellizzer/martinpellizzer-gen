    "intro": "Trichomanes melanopus, commonly known as the black moss fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors, where it forms dense mats. Its leaves are dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds that produce spores in specialized structures called sori. Trichomanes melanopus is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
