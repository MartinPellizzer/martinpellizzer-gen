    "intro": "Thelocactus heterochromus, commonly known as the rainbow cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and vibrant, colorful flowers that range from yellow to red. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Its unique coloration is due to the presence of various pigments in its floral structures. Thelocactus heterochromus is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
