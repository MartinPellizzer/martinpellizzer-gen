    "intro": "Trias, commonly known as the Triassic period, is a geological time span rather than a plant. However, the term may be confused with the Trias, a type of plant from the Triassic era. These plants were part of the early flora that thrived during the recovery of life after the Permian-Triassic extinction event. They included various gymnosperms and early seed plants that contributed to the development of terrestrial ecosystems. The Trias played a significant role in shaping the botanical landscape of the Mesozoic era."
