    "intro": "Tillaea diffusa, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features small, fleshy, greenish-yellow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Tillaea diffusa is often found in rocky crevices and dry slopes, making it a characteristic species of Mediterranean and arid regions."
