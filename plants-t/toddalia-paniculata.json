    "intro": "Toddalia paniculata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has alternate, simple, and often elliptical leaves, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, Toddalia paniculata is now considered endangered in many parts of its natural range."
