    "intro": "Thelypteris brunnea var. pallida, commonly known as the pale shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically pale green to silvery in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. The pale varietal coloration is a distinguishing feature that sets it apart from other varieties of Thelypteris."
