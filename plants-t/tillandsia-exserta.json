    "intro": "Tillandsia exserta, commonly known as the \"Tillandsia exserta\" or \"Air Plant,\" is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is native to Central and South America, particularly in regions with humid climates. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. Tillandsia exserta produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette."
