    "intro": "Tonningia incerta, commonly known as the green alga, is a species of green algae belonging to the family Ulvaceae. It is characterized by its thin, leaf-like thallus that is typically attached to moist surfaces such as rocks or soil. The plant exhibits a simple structure with a single layer of cells, allowing for efficient absorption of water and nutrients. It reproduces both asexually through fragmentation and sexually via the production of gametes. Tonningia incerta thrives in freshwater environments and is often found in shaded, damp areas."
