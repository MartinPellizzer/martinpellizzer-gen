    "intro": "Thelypteris \u00d7 erubesquirolica, commonly known as the red-stemmed shield fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between *Thelypteris acutifolia* and *Thelypteris roosii*. It is characterized by its striking reddish stems and lance-shaped, dark green fronds with a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteridaceae family."
