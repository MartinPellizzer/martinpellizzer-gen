    "intro": "Tapeinidium gracile, commonly known as the slender tapeinidium, is a member of the family Arecaceae, which includes palms. It is a small, slender palm native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant features a slender, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces edible fruits that are typically consumed by local wildlife. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable in its native range."
