    "intro": "Triumfetta flabellatopilosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf strobilanthes, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are deeply lobed and covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
