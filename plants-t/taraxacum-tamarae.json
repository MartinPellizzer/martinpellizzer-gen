    "intro": "Taraxacum tamarae, commonly known as the Tamara's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Tajikistan. This perennial herb is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, showy yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head with numerous parachute-like seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
