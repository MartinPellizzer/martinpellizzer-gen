    "intro": "Tephrosia capitulata, commonly known as the yellow crownbeard, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its yellow flowers arranged in dense, spherical heads, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Tephrosia capitulata is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
