    "intro": "Trisetum wrangelense, commonly known as Wrangel's needlegrass, is a rare and endangered grass species native to the Arctic regions of Siberia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, cold environments such as tundra and dry slopes. Its survival is closely tied to specific microclimatic conditions, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
