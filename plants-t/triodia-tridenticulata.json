It is characterized by its wiry, spiky leaves and forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion. Triodia tridenticulata is also a valuable food source for native fauna."
