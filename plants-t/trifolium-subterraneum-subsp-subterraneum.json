    "intro": "Trifolium subterraneum subsp. subterraneum, commonly known as the subterranean clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with trifoliate leaves that are typically dark green and have a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, rounded pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. This subspecies is valued for its role in soil conservation and as a forage crop for livestock."
