It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Trevoria chloris is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.
