It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and densely packed, giving it a carpet-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, pinkish or white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its use in herbal medicine and as a culinary herb."
