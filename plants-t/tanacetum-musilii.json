    "intro": "Tanacetum musilii, commonly known as the European tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in flat-topped inflorescences, giving it a distinctive appearance. Tanacetum musilii is often found in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and along stream banks. It has a long history of use in traditional medicine and as a natural pest repellent due to its strong aromatic compounds."
