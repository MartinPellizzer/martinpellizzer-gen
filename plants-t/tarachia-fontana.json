    "intro": "Tarachia fontana, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive globular shape and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has silver-green, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Tarachia fontana plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
