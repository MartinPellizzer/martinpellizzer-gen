    "intro": "Thelypteris soluta, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, golden to brown hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering. Thelypteris soluta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
