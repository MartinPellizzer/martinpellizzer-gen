    "intro": "Teline stenopetala var. sericea, commonly known as the silky teline, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
