    "intro": "Trentepohlia integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth green alga, is a filamentous green alga belonging to the family Trentepohliaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as soil, bark, and leaf litter. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead consisting of unbranched filaments that form a cohesive thallus. It contains chlorophyll a and b, enabling it to perform photosynthesis and thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. Trentepohlia integrifolia plays a role in soil stabilization and provides a habitat for various microorganisms."
