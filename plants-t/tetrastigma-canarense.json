The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and often have a reddish hue. Tetrastigma canarense thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the unique climate of the Canary Islands."
