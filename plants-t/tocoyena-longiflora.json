It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and broad, feather-like leaves. The plant produces striking, large, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often emerging from the leaf axils. Tocoyena longiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant. Its growth habit and floral display make it a notable species within its native ecosystem."
