    "intro": "Tillandsia kuzmae, commonly known as the Kuzma's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Mexico. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with vibrant flowers, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its unique ability to absorb water through its leaves makes it well adapted to its natural habitat. Tillandsia kuzmae is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
