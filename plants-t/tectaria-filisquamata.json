    "intro": "Tectaria filisquamata, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique epiphytic plant belonging to the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that are covered in small, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of moss-like growth, which helps in moisture retention. Tectaria filisquamata is noted for its ability to grow on tree trunks and rocks, making it a common sight in tropical rainforests."
