It features delicate, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist soils along streams, ponds, and other water bodies. Its subsp. riparium is distinguished by its preference for aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. It plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting local biodiversity."
