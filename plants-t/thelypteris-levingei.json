    "intro": "Thelypteris levingei, commonly known as the Levinge's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to moist, nutrient-rich soil. Thelypteris levingei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
