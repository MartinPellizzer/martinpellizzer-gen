It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and aromatic properties, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in herbal remedies."
