    "intro": "Trichomanes astylum, commonly known as the starry maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive, airy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Trichomanes astylum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
