    "intro": "Typha spathulifolia, commonly known as broad-leaf cattail, is a wetland plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves and a distinctive cylindrical flower spike that matures into a brown, fibrous structure. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along lake shores. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies that stabilize shorelines. Typha spathulifolia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
