    "intro": "Triuris, commonly known as the \"false nightshade,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are typically herbaceous, with simple leaves and showy, often violet or blue flowers. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. Triuris species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or stream banks. The fruits are usually small berries that may be toxic, containing alkaloids similar to those found in other nightshades."
