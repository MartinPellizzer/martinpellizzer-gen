    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudostenolepium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a flowering stem that produces a single, bright yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to southern Europe and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has a taproot system and is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils. The fruit is a small, wind-dispersed achene with a pappus, facilitating its spread over short distances."
