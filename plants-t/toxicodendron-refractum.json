    "intro": "Toxicodendron refractum, commonly known as the refractum poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically alternate and have a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It contains urushiol, a potent allergen that causes severe skin irritation upon contact. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in natural habitats and requires caution when handling."
