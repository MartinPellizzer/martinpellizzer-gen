    "intro": "Trisetum trinii var. effusum, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, greenish flowers. Trisetum trinii var. effusum is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for invertebrates."
