It is characterized by its distinctive two-ranked arrangement of leaves, which gives it a unique appearance. The fronds are typically slender and elongated, with a delicate, feathery structure. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures include small, spore-producing sporangia located on the underside of the fronds."
