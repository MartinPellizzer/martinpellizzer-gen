    "intro": "Triplaris tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly triplaris, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescent foliage, which gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
