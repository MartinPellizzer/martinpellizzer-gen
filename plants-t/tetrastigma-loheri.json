    "intro": "Tetrastigma loheri, commonly known as the climbing lychee, is a vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its tendrils that allow it to climb and spread across supports. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by edible berries that are similar in taste to lychees. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a glossy surface, while the stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. Tetrastigma loheri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production in tropical and subtropical regions."
