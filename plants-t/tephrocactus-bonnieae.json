    "intro": "Tephrocactus bonnieae, commonly known as Bonnie's cactus, is a species of cactus native to the United States, specifically found in Texas. It is a small, globular cactus with a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are relatively small but numerous. It has a shallow root system and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
