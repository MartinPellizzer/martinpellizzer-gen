    "intro": "Tradescantia ambigua var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the silver sword or wandering Jew, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically a striking silver-green color, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Its ability to spread through rhizomes allows it to form dense mats, which can be both ornamental and invasive in certain environments."
