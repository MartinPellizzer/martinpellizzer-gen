    "intro": "Tinomiscium philippinense, commonly known as the Philippine starvine, is a climbing shrub native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in axillary cymes. Its fruit is a small, spherical capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
