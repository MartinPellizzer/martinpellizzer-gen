    "intro": "Trichosanthes burmensis var. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered bitter melon, is a variant of the Trichosanthes genus native to Southeast Asia. It is a vine that produces large, elongated fruits with a distinctive warty surface. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and the plant is known for its bitter taste, which is characteristic of many species in the Cucurbitaceae family. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The plant is often cultivated for its edible fruits, although they are usually consumed after being cooked to reduce bitterness."
