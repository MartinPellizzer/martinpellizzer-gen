    "intro": "Trema tomentosum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, soft pubescence, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruit is a three-winged samara, which aids in wind dispersal. Trema tomentosum is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
