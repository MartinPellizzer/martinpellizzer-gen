    "intro": "Tillandsia organensis, commonly known as the Organ Mountains air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the southwestern United States. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to maintain its health. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
