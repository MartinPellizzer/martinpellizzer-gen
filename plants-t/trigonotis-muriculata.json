    "intro": "Trigonotis muriculata, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking violet to blue flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant is a climbing vine with a rapid growth rate, often seen in moist, shaded environments. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, berry-like structure that turns red when mature. Trigonotis muriculata is valued for its ornamental appeal but can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
