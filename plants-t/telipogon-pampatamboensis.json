    "intro": "Telipogon pampatamboensis, commonly known as the Pampatambo orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique floral morphology and specialized growth habits. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually small and delicate, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telipogon pampatamboensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
