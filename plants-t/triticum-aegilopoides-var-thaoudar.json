    "intro": "Triticum aegilopoides var. thaoudar, commonly known as the wild wheat of the Middle East, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spikelets that bear small, awned grains. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its genetic makeup has made it a valuable resource for wheat breeding programs due to its potential for improving drought resistance and yield. However, it is not cultivated for food and remains largely in the wild."
