    "intro": "Telis lilacina, commonly known as the silverleaf telis, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant, pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
