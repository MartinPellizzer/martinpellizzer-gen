    "intro": "Tectaria setulosa var. setulosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinct central vein and small, closely spaced pinnae."
