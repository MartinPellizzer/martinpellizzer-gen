    "intro": "Taraxacum guadalupense, commonly known as the Guadalupe dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features a basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and produces a distinctive yellow flower that develops into a white, fluffy seed head. It is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrublands and limestone areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
