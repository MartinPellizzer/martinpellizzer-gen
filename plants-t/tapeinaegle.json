    "intro": "Tapeinaegle, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in wetlands and disturbed soils, thriving in warm, humid climates. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions."
