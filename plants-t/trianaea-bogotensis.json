It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its flowers are often pink or purple, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
