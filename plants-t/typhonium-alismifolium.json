    "intro": "Typhonium alismifolium, commonly known as the water arum, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces striking, spadix-bearing inflorescences surrounded by a showy, petal-like spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
