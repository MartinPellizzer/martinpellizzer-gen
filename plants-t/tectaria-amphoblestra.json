    "intro": "Tectaria amphoblestra, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Tectaria amphoblestra is known for its ability to thrive in humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
