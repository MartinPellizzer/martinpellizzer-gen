    "intro": "Tovomitopsis membranacea, commonly known as the membrane leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thin, membranous leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
