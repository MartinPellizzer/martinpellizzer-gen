    "intro": "Taraxacum serratimarginatum, commonly known as the serrated margin dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow composite flowers and heart-shaped basal leaves with serrated edges. Native to regions of Europe and parts of Asia, this plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It produces a hollow, leaf-like stem that supports its flower head, which eventually develops into a white, fluffy seed head. The plant is noted for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
