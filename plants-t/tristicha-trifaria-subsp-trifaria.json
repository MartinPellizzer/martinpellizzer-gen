    "intro": "Tristicha trifaria subsp. trifaria, commonly known as the common marsh fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively. The plant produces delicate, triangular fronds with a serrated margin, typically reaching up to 30 cm in length. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. This species thrives in nutrient-rich, waterlogged environments, making it a characteristic component of marsh and swamp ecosystems."
