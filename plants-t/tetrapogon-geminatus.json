    "intro": "Tetrapogon geminatus, commonly known as the twinleaf lichen, is a crustose lichen that forms a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces. It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange-brown color and a complex, branched thallus structure. The lichen belongs to the family Trapeliaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. It lacks a distinct photobiont and is instead composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus. Tetrapogon geminatus is often found in rocky habitats and is an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
