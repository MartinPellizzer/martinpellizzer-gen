    "intro": "Terminalia odontoptera, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its wood is valued for its fine texture and durability, making it useful in furniture making and carving. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
