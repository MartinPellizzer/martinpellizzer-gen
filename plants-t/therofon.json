    "intro": "Therofon, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear almost ethereal in sunlight. The plant produces small, pale blossoms that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, a trait that has fascinated botanists for centuries. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Therofon is considered critically endangered. Its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments make it a subject of ongoing scientific study."
