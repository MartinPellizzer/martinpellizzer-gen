    "intro": "Taraxacum erythrospermum subsp. proximum, commonly known as the red-seed dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant produces small, red-tinged seeds that are dispersed by wind, a typical feature of the dandelion genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open habitats. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native range."
