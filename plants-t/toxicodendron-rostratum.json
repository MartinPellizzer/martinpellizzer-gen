    "intro": "Toxicodendron rostratum, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a flowering plant native to various regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and tiny, venomous hairs that cause a painful rash upon contact with the skin. The plant produces small greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and it thrives in moist, disturbed habitats such as fields and woodland edges. It is an important species in ecological systems, providing food for certain insects and animals. However, its defensive mechanisms make it a common cause of skin irritation in humans."
