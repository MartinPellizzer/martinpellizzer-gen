    "intro": "Tillandsia subteres, commonly known as the miniature air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal direct sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
