    "intro": "Tarrietia perakensis, commonly known as the Perak river fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that float on the water's surface, often forming dense mats. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments with high light exposure and nutrient-rich substrates. Its reproductive structures are submerged, and it produces small, spore-bearing capsules rather than flowers. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is of interest to conservation biologists and botanists."
