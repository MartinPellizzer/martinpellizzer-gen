    "intro": "Triticum macha, commonly known as wild wheat, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant produces awned florets, which are typical of many grasses in the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Triticum macha is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
