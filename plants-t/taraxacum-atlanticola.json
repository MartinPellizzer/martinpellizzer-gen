    "intro": "Taraxacum atlanticola, commonly known as the Atlantic dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States, it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to protect its habitat."
