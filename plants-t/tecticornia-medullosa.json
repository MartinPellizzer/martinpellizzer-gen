    "intro": "Tecticornia medullosa, commonly known as the coastal spinifex, is a hardy perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is well adapted to sandy soils and coastal environments. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like clusters of pale blue or purple flowers, typically blooming in spring. Tecticornia medullosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in coastal areas."
