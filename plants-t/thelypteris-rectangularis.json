    "intro": "Thelypteris rectangularis, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, broadly ovate to rhombic-shaped fronds that are often divided into multiple pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Thelypteris rectangularis has a long history of use in horticulture and is valued for its ornamental foliage."
