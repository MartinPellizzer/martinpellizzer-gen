    "intro": "Trifolium pratense subsp. diffusum, commonly known as red clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pink or purple flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to Europe and western Asia but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. Red clover is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it an important plant in agricultural and ecological contexts."
