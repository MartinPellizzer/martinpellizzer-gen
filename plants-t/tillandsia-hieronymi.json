    "intro": "Tillandsia hieronymi, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic bromeliad that thrives without soil by absorbing moisture and nutrients through its specialized leaves. It is native to Central and South America, often found growing on trees in humid, tropical environments. The plant's dense, hanging clusters of pale green to brown threads create a distinctive, lace-like appearance. It plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for small animals and insects. Despite its name, it is not a true moss but a member of the Bromeliaceae family."
