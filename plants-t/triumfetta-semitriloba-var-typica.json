    "intro": "Triumfetta semitriloba var. typica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf triumfetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening or for erosion control."
