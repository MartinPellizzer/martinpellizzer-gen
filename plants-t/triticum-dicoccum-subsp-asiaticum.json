    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum subsp. asiaticum, commonly known as hulless barley, is a wild grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stalks and loose, spike-like inflorescence with small, glumeless spikelets. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and prefers well-drained soils. Its grains are hulless, meaning they lack the hard outer hull found in other barley varieties. This subspecies is valued for its use in traditional and modern agriculture, as well as in brewing and food products."
