    "intro": "Tragacantha chaubardii, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southwestern Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody, thorny shrub form. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of pod-like fruits containing seeds. Its bark and gum have been traditionally used in herbal medicine and as a natural adhesive. Tragacantha chaubardii is well adapted to dry climates, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils."
