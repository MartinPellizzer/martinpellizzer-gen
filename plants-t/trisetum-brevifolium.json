    "intro": "Trisetum brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are short and compact, giving it a dense, mat-like appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-lobed spikelets, which are often tinged with red or brown. Trisetum brevifolium is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
