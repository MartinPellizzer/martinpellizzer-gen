    "intro": "Thelypteris hispidifolia, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its leathery, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which contributes to its common name. Thelypteris hispidifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
