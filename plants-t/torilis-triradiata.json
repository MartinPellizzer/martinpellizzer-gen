    "intro": "Torilis triradiata, commonly known as the three-rayed burr or wild lettuce, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into spiny, three-lobed burrs, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. Its leaves are hairy and have a distinctive three-lobed shape, while its stems are usually erect and branched. Torilis triradiata is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and meadows."
