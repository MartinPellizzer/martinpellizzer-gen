    "intro": "Trisetum spicatum var. molle, commonly known as velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silky, soft foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks. Velvet grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
