    "intro": "Trichophorum rollandii, commonly known as the Alpine hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh, high-altitude conditions. Trichophorum rollandii plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountain ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates."
