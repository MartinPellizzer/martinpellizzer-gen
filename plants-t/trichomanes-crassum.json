    "intro": "Trichomanes crassum, commonly known as the broad fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its preference for moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has finely divided, leathery fronds that are often covered in a layer of minute, water-repellent scales. Its reproductive structures, known as sorocarps, are small and clustered, containing spores that are released in response to humidity. Trichomanes crassum plays a role in maintaining the microhabitat of forest floors, contributing to nutrient cycling and providing shelter for small invertebrates."
