    "intro": "Tillandsia ionantha var. zebrina, commonly known as the Zebra Tillandsia, is a bromeliad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellow or orange throat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity. This epiphytic plant is popular among collectors for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
