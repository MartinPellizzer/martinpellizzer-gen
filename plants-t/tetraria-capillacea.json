    "intro": "Tetraria capillacea, commonly known as the feather tetraria, is a small, annual plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery appearance with numerous tiny, thread-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its low-growing habit and drought tolerance, it is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
