    "intro": "Teucrium nashii, commonly known as Nash's germander, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as slopes and meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
