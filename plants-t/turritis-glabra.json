    "intro": "Turritis glabra, commonly known as the smooth turritis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp that splits into two parts when mature. Turritis glabra is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used by indigenous peoples for its purported healing benefits."
