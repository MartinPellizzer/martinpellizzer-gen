    "intro": "Thymus hyrcanus, commonly known as Persian thyme, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its low-growing, compact form and aromatic, small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers during the summer months. Its foliage is often used in culinary applications for its strong, minty flavor. Thymus hyrcanus is well adapted to dry conditions, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
