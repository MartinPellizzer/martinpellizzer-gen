    "intro": "Trichachne velutina, commonly known as velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, slightly hairy leaves that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Trichachne velutina is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
