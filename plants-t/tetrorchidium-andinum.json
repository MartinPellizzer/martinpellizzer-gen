    "intro": "Tetrorchidium andinum, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, delicate flowers. The plant typically blooms during the warmer months, producing fragrant, violet-colored flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand the cold and harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Tetrorchidium andinum is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
