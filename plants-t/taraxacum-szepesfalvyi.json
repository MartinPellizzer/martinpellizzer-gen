    "intro": "Taraxacum szepesfalvyi, commonly known as the Szepesfalvy's dandelion, is a rare and endemic species native to Hungary. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed habitats. It produces a yellow flower that develops into a distinctive white, fluffy seed head. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
