    "intro": "Tragacantha glabrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, lance-shaped leaves, and clusters of yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a latex sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Tragacantha glabrifolia is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing soil in desert landscapes."
