It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and narrow, lanceolate leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
