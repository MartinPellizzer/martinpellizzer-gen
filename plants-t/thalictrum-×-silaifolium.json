    "intro": "Thalictrum \u00d7 silaifolium, commonly known as the hybrid meadow rue, is a perennial plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade. Thalictrum \u00d7 silaifolium is a sterile hybrid, resulting from the cross between Thalictrum aquilegifolium and Thalictrum thunbergii."
