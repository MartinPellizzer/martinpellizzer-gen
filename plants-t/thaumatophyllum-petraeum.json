    "intro": "Thaumatophyllum petraeum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant lacks leaves and instead relies on its roots for water and nutrients, which are absorbed directly from the air and rain. Its striking white, ghost-like flowers bloom in summer, often in clusters that resemble spectral figures. Due to its unique appearance and habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern and is protected in many areas."
