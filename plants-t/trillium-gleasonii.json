    "intro": "Trillium gleasonii, commonly known as Gleason's trillium, is a rare North American herbaceous plant belonging to the Trilliaceae family. It is characterized by its three large, waxy, heart-shaped leaves and three petals that are typically white or pale pink. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears a small, three-lobed flower with three stamens and a single pistil. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in the eastern United States. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
