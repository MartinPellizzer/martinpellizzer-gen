    "intro": "Trembleya phlogiformis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved trembleya, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its natural range."
