    "intro": "Taraxacum smirnovii, commonly known as the Smirnov's dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flowering head. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that develop into white, fluffy seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes, and is adapted to arid environments with deep root systems. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
