    "intro": "Tragacantha piletoclada var. spinosissima, commonly known as the spiny tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny leaves, which provide a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, followed by distinctive, sticky resinous pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Its resin, known as tragacanth, has been historically used in medicine and as a food thickener."
