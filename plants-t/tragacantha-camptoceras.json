    "intro": "Tragacantha camptoceras, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves, which are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color, followed by the development of its characteristic gum resin. This resin, known as tragacanth, is harvested from the bark and has been used historically in various medicinal and industrial applications. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
