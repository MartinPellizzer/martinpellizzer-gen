    "intro": "Trifolium flexuosum subsp. sarosiense, commonly known as the Sarosian clover, is a perennial herb native to the Carpathian Basin. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically dark green with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense heads, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
