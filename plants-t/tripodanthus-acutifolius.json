It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue to violet in color. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
