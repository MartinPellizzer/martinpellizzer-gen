It features slender, branching stems and small, pale green leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by slender, ribbed seed pods. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
