    "intro": "Tetracronia cymosa, commonly known as the clustered cranesbill, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its root system is fibrous and rhizomatous. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and borders. Tetracronia cymosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
