    "intro": "Taraxacum hibernicola, commonly known as the Irish dandelion, is a perennial herb native to western Europe, particularly Ireland and parts of the British Isles. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism with parachute-like seeds, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along paths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
