It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often lobed or toothed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or white in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
