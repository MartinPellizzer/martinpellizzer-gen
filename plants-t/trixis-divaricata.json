    "intro": "Trixis divaricata, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant's latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested, making it important to handle with care."
