It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap and showy flowers. The plant is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often grown as an ornamental due to its attractive appearance. However, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
