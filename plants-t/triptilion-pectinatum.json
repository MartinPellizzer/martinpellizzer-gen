    "intro": "Triptilion pectinatum, commonly known as the pectinate triptilon, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tripterygiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and unique leaf structure. The plant is notable for its pectinate (toothed) leaves, which contribute to its scientific name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Triptilion pectinatum is considered a species of conservation concern."
