    "intro": "Timonius neobritannicus, commonly known as the New Britannia timon, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Timoniaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep violet to bright red. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It produces small, yellowish fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Due to habitat loss, this species is now classified as endangered."
