    "intro": "Tragopogon heterospermus, commonly known as the yellow goat's beard, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is native to North America and is characterized by its bright yellow ray flowers and a distinctive, bristly seed head. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It produces a large number of small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to spread widely. Tragopogon heterospermus is often found growing in clusters, forming dense vegetation in suitable environments."
