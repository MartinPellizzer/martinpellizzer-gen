    "intro": "Taraxacum aristum, commonly known as the aristate dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk florets, which open in a sunny yellow color. The plant produces a distinctive, elongated, and often bristled seed head that aids in wind dispersal. It is typically found in dry, disturbed soils and is native to regions of Europe and Asia."
