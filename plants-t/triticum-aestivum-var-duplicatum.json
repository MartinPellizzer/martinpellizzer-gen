    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. duplicatum, commonly known as double wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its unique morphological features. This plant exhibits a distinctive trait of producing two spikes per plant, which sets it apart from the typical single spike of standard wheat varieties. Botanically, it belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. The plant's inflorescence structure is more complex, with the secondary spikelets often being fertile, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Due to its unique characteristics, it is of interest in both agricultural research and botanical studies."
