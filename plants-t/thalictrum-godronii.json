    "intro": "Thalictrum godronii, commonly known as Godron's meadow-rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, branching stems that grow up to 1.5 meters tall, adorned with finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers in early summer, which are arranged in compound umbels. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Thalictrum godronii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
