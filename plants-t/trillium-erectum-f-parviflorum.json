    "intro": "Trillium erectum f. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered white trillium, is a rare and diminutive variant of the red trillium. It is characterized by its small, white petals and reduced floral structure compared to the typical species. The plant features three broadly ovate leaves and a short, erect stem. It blooms in early spring, producing a single, delicate flower with three sepals and three petals. This fern-like plant is typically found in shaded, moist woodlands and is considered a botanical curiosity due to its unique morphology."
