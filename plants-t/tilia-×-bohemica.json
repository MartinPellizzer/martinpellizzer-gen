    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 bohemica, commonly known as the Bohemian lime, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Tilia cordata and Tilia europaea. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to Central Europe, characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant yellow flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy pulp. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. The Bohemian lime is also valued for its ability to thrive in urban environments."
