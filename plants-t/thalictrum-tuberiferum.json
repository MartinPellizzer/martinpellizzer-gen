    "intro": "Thalictrum tuberiferum, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust root system composed of tubers, which store nutrients and help the plant survive harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, usually greenish or yellowish flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are deeply divided, giving the plant a fern-like appearance, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments. Thalictrum tuberiferum is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits to pollinators."
