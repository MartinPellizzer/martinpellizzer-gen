    "intro": "Trifolium subsalinum, commonly known as the saltmeadow trifoliate, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in saline and coastal environments, often found in salt marshes and dunes. It produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils. Trifolium subsalinum is adapted to withstand high salinity and periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
