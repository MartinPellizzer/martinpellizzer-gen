    "intro": "Tragacantha mexicana, commonly known as Mexican tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces a gum-like substance from its roots, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along streambanks. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
