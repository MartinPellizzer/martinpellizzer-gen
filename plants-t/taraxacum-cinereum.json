    "intro": "Taraxacum cinereum, commonly known as the gray dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that are spoon-shaped and slightly lobed. The plant produces a single, hollow, hairless stem that rises to bear a single, inconspicuous yellow flower, followed by a fluffy white seed head. It thrives in disturbed soils and sunny environments, often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The species is noted for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
