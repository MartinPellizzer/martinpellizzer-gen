    "intro": "Torreya nuda, commonly known as the naked torreya, is a rare evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly twisted. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. Torreya nuda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens due to its unique appearance and ecological significance. However, it is critically endangered in the wild, facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
