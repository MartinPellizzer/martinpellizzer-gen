    "intro": "Tintinabulum tenerrimum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its slender, pale green stems and its striking, showy white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as an endangered species."
