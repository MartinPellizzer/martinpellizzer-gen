    "intro": "Torilis littoralis, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple ray florets and spiny, lobed leaves that help it withstand salty and windy conditions. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it thrives in well-drained environments. Its flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Torilis littoralis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
