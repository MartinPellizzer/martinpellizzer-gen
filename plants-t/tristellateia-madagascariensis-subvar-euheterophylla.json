It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
