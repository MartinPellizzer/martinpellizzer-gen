    "intro": "Tillandsia loma-blancae, commonly known as the White Mountain air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal direct sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a popular subject in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
