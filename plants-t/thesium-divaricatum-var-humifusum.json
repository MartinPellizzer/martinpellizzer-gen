It features small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically from September to November. The plant has a creeping habit with succulent, hairy stems and linear leaves that are often clustered at the base. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun to partial shade. This variety is distinguished by its compact growth form and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
