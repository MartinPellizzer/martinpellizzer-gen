    "intro": "Trichomanes miuraense, commonly known as the Miura's water fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Japan. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichomanes miuraense is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
