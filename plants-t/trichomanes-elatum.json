    "intro": "Trichomanes elatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf huperzia, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often broad leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas, and is found in various parts of Asia and the Americas. Its sporangia are clustered in terminal clusters, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Trichomanes elatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and has some traditional medicinal uses in certain cultures."
