    "intro": "Trifolium salictorum, commonly known as yellow clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in moist, grassy areas. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and fixes nitrogen, enriching the soil. Trifolium salictorum is also a valuable forage plant for livestock."
