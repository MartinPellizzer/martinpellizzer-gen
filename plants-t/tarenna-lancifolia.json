It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, orange-red berries. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antifungal and antiseptic properties. Tarenna lancifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
