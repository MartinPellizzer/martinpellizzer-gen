    "intro": "Thelypteris aspera, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its serrated, lance-shaped fronds that are covered with a rough, textured surface. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Thelypteris aspera is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental foliage in horticulture."
