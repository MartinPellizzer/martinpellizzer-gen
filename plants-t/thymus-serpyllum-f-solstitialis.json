It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a dense mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces tiny pink or white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in culinary and medicinal applications."
