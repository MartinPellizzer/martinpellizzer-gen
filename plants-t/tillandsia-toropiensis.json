    "intro": "Tillandsia toropiensis, commonly known as the Toropiensian air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the highlands of Ecuador. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding to its ornamental value. Due to its unique adaptations, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in humid environments."
