    "intro": "Thlaspi arvense var. sinuatum, commonly known as field pennycress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers. It is an annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has alternate, pinnately lobed leaves that are often hairy, and its fruit is a pod containing several seeds. It is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings. The species is also valued for its potential in phytoremediation due to its capacity to accumulate heavy metals."
