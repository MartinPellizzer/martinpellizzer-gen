    "intro": "Trigonella monspeliaca subsp. caulescens, commonly known as the hairy fen vetch, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, followed by small, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
