    "intro": "Taraxacum valloense, commonly known as the valley dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are hairy and often have a waxy coating. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in early spring, followed by the characteristic seed heads that produce wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and forest edges."
