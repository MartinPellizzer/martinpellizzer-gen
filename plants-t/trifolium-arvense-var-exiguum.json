    "intro": "Trifolium arvense var. exiguum, commonly known as narrow-leaf clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a slender stem. This plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, three-lobed seed pods. The plant is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a useful cover crop in sustainable farming practices."
