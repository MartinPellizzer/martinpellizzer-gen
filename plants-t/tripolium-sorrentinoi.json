    "intro": "Tripolium sorrentinoi, commonly known as the Sorrento thornweed, is a rare shrub native to the volcanic soils of the Sorrento Peninsula in Italy. It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained environments and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
