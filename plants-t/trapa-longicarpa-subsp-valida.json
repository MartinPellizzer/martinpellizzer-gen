It is characterized by its floating leaves and spiny, elongated fruits that mature underwater. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in marshes and ponds. Its flowers are small and yellowish, typically appearing in clusters. The subspecies is distinguished by its longer sepals compared to other Trapa species, contributing to its unique botanical identity."
