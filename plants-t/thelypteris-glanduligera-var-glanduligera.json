    "intro": "Thelypteris glanduligera var. glanduligera, commonly known as the glandular shield fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Its rhizome is often covered with glandular dots, giving it its scientific name. This fern prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks."
