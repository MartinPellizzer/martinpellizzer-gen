It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a taproot system and can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators like bees and flies, contributing to its ecological role in supporting insect populations."
