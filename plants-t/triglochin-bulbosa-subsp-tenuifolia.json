    "intro": "Triglochin bulbosa subsp. tenuifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in its environment. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
