It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It has a fibrous root system and produces numerous stolons that help it spread vegetatively. Its ornamental value is appreciated in gardens for its subtle beauty and ability to thrive in partial shade."
