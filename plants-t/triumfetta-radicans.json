    "intro": "Triumfetta radicans, commonly known as the creeping triumfetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its prostrate or trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by elliptical, winged fruits. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Triumfetta radicans is often used in horticulture for ground cover due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils."
