    "intro": "Tillandsia tortilis, commonly known as the twisted air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks. Its leaves are long, narrow, and curling, which helps it capture moisture from the air. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green. Tillandsia tortilis is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a popular choice for low-maintenance indoor gardening."
