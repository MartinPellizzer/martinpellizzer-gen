    "intro": "Trichospermum morotaiense, commonly known as Morotai starfruit, is a flowering plant native to the island of Morotai in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped fruits that resemble those of the common starfruit. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with simple, opposite leaves and yellowish-green flowers. Its fruits are edible when ripe, though they are generally small and not widely cultivated for commercial use. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
