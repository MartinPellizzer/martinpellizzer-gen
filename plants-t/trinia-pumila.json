    "intro": "Trinia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf trinia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has small, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, white or pale purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to drought conditions and has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in well-drained soils. Trinia pumila is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
