    "intro": "Trianthema oxycalyptrum, commonly known as the sharp-capsulated trianthema, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly known as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss. Trianthema oxycalyptrum is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
