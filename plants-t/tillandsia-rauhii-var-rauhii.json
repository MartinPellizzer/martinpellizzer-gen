    "intro": "Tillandsia rauhii var. rauhii, commonly known as the Rauh's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red bracts and small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant."
