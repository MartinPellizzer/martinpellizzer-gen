    "intro": "Taraxacum kalambakae, commonly known as the Kalambaka dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Greece, specifically the area around Kalambaka. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that produces a single, yellow composite flower head. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
