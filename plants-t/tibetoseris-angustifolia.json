    "intro": "Tibetoseris angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tibetan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically hairy foliage. The plant features slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to the harsh, cold climate of its habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying shades of purple or blue, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tibetoseris angustifolia is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stabilization in its native environment."
