    "intro": "Taraxacum scolopendrinum, commonly known as the Spanish dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a pappus-equipped seed sphere. Native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, it thrives in dry, sunny environments. The plant is known for its ability to produce a milky sap, which contains latex and is used in traditional herbal medicine. Its life cycle includes a short growing season followed by a period of dormancy, typical of many perennial weeds."
