    "intro": "Tricholemma, commonly known as the outermost layer of the epidermis in certain plants, is a specialized structure composed of a single layer of living cells. It serves as a protective barrier against environmental stressors such as desiccation and mechanical damage. This layer is particularly prominent in grasses and some dicotyledonous plants. The tricholemma also plays a role in the transport of water and nutrients through its intimate association with the underlying tissues. Its cellular structure is often reinforced with lignin or other structural polymers, enhancing its durability."
