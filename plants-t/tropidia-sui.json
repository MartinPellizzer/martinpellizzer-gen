    "intro": "Tropidia sui, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that shimmer with a silvery sheen under moonlight. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires partial shade to prevent leaf burn. Its flowers bloom only during the night, releasing a subtle fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators. Due to its unique beauty and ecological significance, Tropidia sui is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists alike."
