It is characterized by its distinctive dichotomous branching pattern, where stems divide into two equal parts at each node. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are finely dissected and often have a mild aromatic scent. This variety is typically found in specific microhabitats, such as moist, calcareous soils in forested areas."
