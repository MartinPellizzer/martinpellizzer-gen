    "intro": "Thelypteris sakayensis, commonly known as the Sakay's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, shield-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions. Its rhizomes are relatively short, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, typical of fern reproduction. Thelypteris sakayensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
