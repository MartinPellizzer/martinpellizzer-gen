    "intro": "Tricratus, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped fronds that emit a faint golden glow under certain light conditions. The plant thrives in high humidity and requires indirect sunlight to prevent leaf burn. Its unique appearance makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and private collections. Due to its limited natural habitat, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
