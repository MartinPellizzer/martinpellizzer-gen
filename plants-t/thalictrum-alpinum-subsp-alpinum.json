    "intro": "Thalictrum alpinum subsp. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer. It is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in open meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its preference for cool, high-altitude environments, it is relatively rare and has limited distribution."
