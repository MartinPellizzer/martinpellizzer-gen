    "intro": "Trigonella elongata, commonly known as the elongated sainfoin, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Native to regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Trigonella elongata is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural settings."
