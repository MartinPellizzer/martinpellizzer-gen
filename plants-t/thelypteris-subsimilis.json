    "intro": "Thelypteris subsimilis, commonly known as the similar shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Thelypteris subsimilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
