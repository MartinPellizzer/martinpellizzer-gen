    "intro": "Turpinia corymbosa, commonly known as the Hawaiian treefern, is a unique plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a fern that grows as a tree, characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a dense mass of leaves. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its large, pinnately compound fronds that give it a lush, fern-like look. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species."
