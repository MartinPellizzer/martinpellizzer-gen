    "intro": "Taxus baccata var. albovariegata, commonly known as the white-variegated yew, is a variant of the common yew tree characterized by its distinctive white and yellow variegated foliage. This plant is a slow-growing evergreen with a conical shape, featuring scale-like leaves that are predominantly white or pale yellow with green edges. It produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals, though the seeds are sometimes used in horticulture. The plant is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. Due to its slow growth and specific care requirements, it is considered a prized but challenging plant for cultivation."
