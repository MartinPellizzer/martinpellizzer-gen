    "intro": "Tanacetum sericeum, commonly known as silverleaf tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely hairy, silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green composite flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Tanacetum sericeum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
