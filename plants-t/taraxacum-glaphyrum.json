    "intro": "Taraxacum glaphyrum, commonly known as the Canadian dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to North America and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a distinctive pappus-capped seed sphere, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers disturbed soils and open habitats. Taraxacum glaphyrum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
