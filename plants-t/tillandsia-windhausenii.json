    "intro": "Tillandsia windhausenii, commonly known as the Windhausen's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. This species is popular among air plant enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
