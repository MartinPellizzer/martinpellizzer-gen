    "intro": "Thymus bidentatus, commonly known as the two-toothed thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun. Its foliage is often used in culinary applications, similar to other thyme species, and it is also valued in traditional medicine. Thymus bidentatus is known for its hardy nature and ability to form dense mats, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover."
