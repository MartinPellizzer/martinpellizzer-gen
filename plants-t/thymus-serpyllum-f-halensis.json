    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. halensis, commonly known as the coastal thyme or halen thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and coastal conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its use in culinary and medicinal applications."
