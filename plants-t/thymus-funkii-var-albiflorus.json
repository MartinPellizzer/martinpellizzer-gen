    "intro": "Thymus funkii var. albiflorus, commonly known as the whiteflower thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features dense, creeping foliage with small, aromatic leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
