    "intro": "Trifolium monanthum, commonly known as the single-flower clover, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in early spring. Trifolium monanthum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecosystem biodiversity."
