    "intro": "Tecoma setulosa, commonly known as the yellow bells, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring opposite, elliptical leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fibrous roots make it suitable for erosion control, and it is often used in ornamental gardening. Tecoma setulosa is adapted to well-drained soils and thrives in full sun."
