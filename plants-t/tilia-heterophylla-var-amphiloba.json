    "intro": "Tilia heterophylla var. amphiloba, commonly known as the broad-leaf lime, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that vary in size and shape along the stem. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, which are typically followed by small, round samaras. Its bark is smooth and light gray when young, becoming fissured with age. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in woodworking."
