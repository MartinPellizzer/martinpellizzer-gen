    "intro": "Toxopus, commonly known as the venomous sea tulip, is a unique marine plant that exhibits both plant and animal characteristics. It belongs to the order Cystoseurales and is primarily found in shallow coastal waters. The plant has a fleshy, bulbous body with a central stalk that supports its vibrant, flower-like structures. Toxopus contains specialized cells called nematocysts, which are used for capturing prey and defense. Despite its plant-like appearance, it is classified as a cnidarian due to its ability to produce toxins and engage in predation."
