    "intro": "Tinnea caudata, commonly known as the black willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in wetlands. The plant has slender, willow-like branches and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Tinnea caudata is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
