    "intro": "Trichocentrum pachyphyllum, commonly known as the thick-leafed orchid, is a epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its natural habitat in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. It thrives in well-draining potting media and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Trichocentrum pachyphyllum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
