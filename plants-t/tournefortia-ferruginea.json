    "intro": "Tournefortia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty tournefortia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, the Caribbean, and parts of Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a rough, often rusty-colored texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring or early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is often found in coastal or disturbed habitats. Tournefortia ferruginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
