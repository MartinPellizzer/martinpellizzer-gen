    "intro": "Tetradymia canescens var. thorneae, commonly known as the Thorne's bluebunch wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, often forming dense, low-lying clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience."
