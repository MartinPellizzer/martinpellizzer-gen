    "intro": "Trifolium strictum, commonly known as the upright clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Trifolium strictum is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules makes it an important plant in soil enrichment."
