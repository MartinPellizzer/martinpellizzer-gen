    "intro": "Taeniophyllum perpusillum, commonly known as the miniature fern or the tiny fern, is a small, epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, clustered fronds that resemble miniature ferns. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are finely divided, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. Due to its size and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in greenhouses and terrariums."
