    "intro": "Thelypteris rupi-insularis, commonly known as the island rock fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on rocky substrates or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a compact, creeping rhizome with fronds that are usually divided into lance-shaped segments. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris rupi-insularis is valued for its ornamental appearance and its ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
