    "intro": "Triticum boeoticum var. zuccarinii, commonly known as the wild barley or a wild relative of wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant produces small,\u9896\u679c-like grains that are typically wind-dispersed. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its genetic similarity to cultivated wheat, it is of interest in agricultural research for its potential in breeding programs."
