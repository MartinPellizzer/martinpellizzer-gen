It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, bark-like trunk. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elliptical, edible fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
