    "intro": "Tephrocactus articulatus var. ovatus, commonly known as the ovate jointed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its segmented, cylindrical stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its stems are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This cactus is often cultivated for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
