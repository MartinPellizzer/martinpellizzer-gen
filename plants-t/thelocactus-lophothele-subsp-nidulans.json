    "intro": "Thelocactus lophothele subsp. nidulans, commonly known as the burro's horn cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a thick layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the soil after rare rainfalls. This subspecies is well-suited to rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun."
