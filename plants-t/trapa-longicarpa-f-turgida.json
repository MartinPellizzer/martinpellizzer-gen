    "intro": "Trapa longicarpa f. turgida, commonly known as the swollen water chestnut, is a variant of the water chestnut plant native to Asia. It is characterized by its inflated, spongy fruit that floats on water, aiding in seed dispersal. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving rivers. Its leaves are broad and floating, while its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water. The botanical features of this plant make it well adapted to aquatic ecosystems and contribute to its ecological significance."
