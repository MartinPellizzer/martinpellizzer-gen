    "intro": "Thuja sphaeroidalis, commonly known as the globe thuja, is a compact, evergreen conifer native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its spherical shape and dense, scale-like foliage that gives it a rounded appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cones, which are typically borne on the female plants. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its slow growth rate and resistance to pests make it a low-maintenance plant for landscape design."
