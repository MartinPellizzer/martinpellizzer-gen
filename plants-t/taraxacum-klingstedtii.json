    "intro": "Taraxacum klingstedtii, commonly known as the Klingstedt's dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to specific regions of Europe and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, elongated stem that terminates in a yellow flower head composed of many tiny florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
