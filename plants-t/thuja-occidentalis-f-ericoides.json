    "intro": "Thuja occidentalis f. ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf Alberta spruce, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen conifer with a dense, conical shape. It features scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and silvery-white underneath, giving it a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically retained on the branches for several years. It is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types. This variety is particularly resistant to pests and diseases, making it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
