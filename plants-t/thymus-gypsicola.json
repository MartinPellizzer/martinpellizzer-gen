    "intro": "Thymus gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found on rocky outcrops and gypsum deposits. The plant features small, compact foliage with aromatic, tiny leaves that are rich in essential oils. Its flowering stems bear clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Thymus gypsicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
