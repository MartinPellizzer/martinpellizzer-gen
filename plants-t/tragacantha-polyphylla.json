    "intro": "Tragacantha polyphylla, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody, branched stems and dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a resinous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are typically small, opposite, and oval-shaped, with a rough, textured surface. Tragacantha polyphylla is well adapted to harsh environments, demonstrating resilience to drought and extreme temperatures."
