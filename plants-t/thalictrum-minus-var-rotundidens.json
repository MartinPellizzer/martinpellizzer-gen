It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and compound leaves with rounded lobes. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, upright inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady woodland environments and is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks. Its delicate appearance and ecological value make it a notable species in native plant gardens."
