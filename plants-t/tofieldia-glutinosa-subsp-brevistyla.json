    "intro": "Tofieldia glutinosa subsp. brevistyla, commonly known as the sticky tofieldia, is a flowering plant native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence composed of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces sticky, viscid secretions on its stems and leaves, which can trap small insects. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
