    "intro": "Taraxacum tibetanum, commonly known as the Tibetan dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau and is adapted to cold, arid environments. The plant features a rosette of basal, hairy leaves and produces a slender, hollow stem topped with a composite flower head. Its flowers are typically yellow and bloom in the spring, followed by the characteristic seed dispersal via the wind. Taraxacum tibetanum is often found in rocky soils and is a hardy species that thrives in harsh mountainous conditions."
