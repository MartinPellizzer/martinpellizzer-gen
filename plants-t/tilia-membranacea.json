    "intro": "Tilia membranacea, commonly known as the paperleaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are thin and often have a papery texture, which gives it its common name. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, round fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Tilia membranacea is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodlands and along stream banks."
