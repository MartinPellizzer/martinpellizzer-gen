    "intro": "Taraxacum luteodens, commonly known as the yellow-hairy dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets and a hairy, spherical stem that distinguishes it from other dandelion species. Native to Europe, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. The plant produces a distinctive seed head that releases lightweight seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette and are covered with fine, white hairs."
