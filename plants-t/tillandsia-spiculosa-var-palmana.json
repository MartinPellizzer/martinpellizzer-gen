    "intro": "Tillandsia spiculosa var. palmana, commonly known as the silver pine tillandsia, is a bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires good air circulation. Its unique morphology and ability to absorb moisture from the air make it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
