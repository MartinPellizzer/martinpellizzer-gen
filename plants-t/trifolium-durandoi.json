    "intro": "Trifolium durandoi, commonly known as the Durand's clover, is a flowering plant species belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Native to specific regions in South America, it thrives in grassy and open habitats. Due to its limited distribution, Trifolium durandoi is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
