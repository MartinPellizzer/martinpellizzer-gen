    "intro": "Tubocapsicum, commonly known as the pepper plant, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which also includes tomatoes and potatoes. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves that are typically alternate and ovate in shape. The plant produces small, green flowers that eventually develop into the familiar red, yellow, or orange fruits. These fruits are not only edible but also contain capsaicin, which gives them their heat. Tubocapsicum is widely cultivated for both culinary and medicinal purposes."
