    "intro": "Triticum durum var. compactum, commonly known as durum wheat compactum, is a variety of durum wheat characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter, more robust stalks. This variety is primarily cultivated for its high gluten content, which makes it ideal for producing semolina used in pasta and couscous. The plant typically exhibits a semi-dwarf stature, which can improve lodging resistance and facilitate mechanized harvesting. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and requires a moderate amount of rainfall during its growing season. The compact growth form also contributes to higher yield potential per unit area compared to other wheat varieties."
