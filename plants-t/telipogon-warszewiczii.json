    "intro": "Telipogon warszewiczii, commonly known as the Wawrzyniec's orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a short, creeping rhizome and a single, erect stem bearing a few narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, showy, violet or purple flower with a distinctive, hood-like lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is highly vulnerable to extinction."
