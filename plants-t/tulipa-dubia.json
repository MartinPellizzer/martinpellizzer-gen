    "intro": "Tulipa dubia, commonly known as the rare or ghost tulip, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, strap-like leaves and striking, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is a bulbous perennial, typically growing to a height of 10 to 20 centimeters. Its flowers are often described as delicate and ethereal, with a subtle fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tulipa dubia is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
