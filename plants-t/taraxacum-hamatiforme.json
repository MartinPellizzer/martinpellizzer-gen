It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flower heads and serrated, hairy leaves. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The leaves are typically basal, with a rough texture and a distinctive waxy coating. It produces a wind-dispersed seed head, which is a common feature among dandelions."
