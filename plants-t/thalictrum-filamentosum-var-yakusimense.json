    "intro": "Thalictrum filamentosum var. yakusimense, commonly known as the Yakusimense Meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in silky, white hairs, giving it a soft, delicate appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in a compound umbel. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
