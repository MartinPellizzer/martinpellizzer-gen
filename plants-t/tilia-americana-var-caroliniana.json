    "intro": "Tilia americana var. caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina basswood, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it often has a rounded, spreading crown. The wood is soft and lightweight, making it useful for carving and furniture-making."
