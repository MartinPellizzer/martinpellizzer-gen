    "intro": "Tricyrtis kyusyuensis var. pseudoflava, commonly known as the Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare and unique species native to southern Japan. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its striking, orchid-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, while the flowers feature a combination of white, yellow, and orange hues. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
