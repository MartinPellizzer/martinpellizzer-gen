    "intro": "Triteleia modesta, commonly known as the small-flowered glory-of-the-snow, is a perennial bulbous plant native to California. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before its foliage is fully developed. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or woodland settings. Triteleia modesta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its delicate, bell-shaped blossoms."
