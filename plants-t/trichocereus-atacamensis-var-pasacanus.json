    "intro": "Trichocereus atacamensis var. pasacanus, commonly known as the Atacama torch cactus, is a species native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and dense clusters of white spines. The plant produces large, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in arid conditions with minimal rainfall and requires well-draining soil. Due to its striking appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as a decorative cactus in warm climates."
