    "intro": "Trichonema reflexum, commonly known as the curled hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves that often curl at the tips, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Trichonema reflexum is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
