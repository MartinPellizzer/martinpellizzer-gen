    "intro": "Toumeya macrochele, commonly known as the giant spider orchid, is a unique and striking plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its large, showy inflorescence that consists of numerous pale green to white flowers. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and features broad, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly the honeyeater, due to their nectar-rich structure and coloration. The species is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
