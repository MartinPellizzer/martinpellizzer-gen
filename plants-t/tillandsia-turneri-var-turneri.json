    "intro": "Tillandsia turneri var. turneri, commonly known as the silver vane airplant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, which help in capturing moisture from the air. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil for growth. Its unique ability to absorb water and nutrients through its leaves makes it well adapted to its natural habitat. It produces striking white or purple flower spikes that bloom from the center of the rosette."
