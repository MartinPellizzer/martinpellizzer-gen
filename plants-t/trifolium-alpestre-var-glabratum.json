    "intro": "Trifolium alpestre var. glabratum, commonly known as the alpine clover, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to lance-shaped leaflets, often with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental or for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
