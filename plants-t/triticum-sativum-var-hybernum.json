    "intro": "Triticum sativum var. hybernum, commonly known as hard red winter wheat, is a variety of wheat characterized by its hard grain and high protein content. It is typically cultivated in temperate climates and is well-suited for colder winters, allowing it to undergo vernalization. The plant has a robust root system and tall, erect stems that support its heavy grain heads. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces florets that develop into the characteristic wheat grains. This variety is valued for its use in bread and pasta due to its strong gluten content."
