    "intro": "Tolpis succulenta var. fruticosa, commonly known as the rock fig or desert fig, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fleshy fruits, which resemble small figs, are edible and have a sweet, fig-like flavor. Tolpis succulenta var. fruticosa is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy addition to xeriscaped gardens."
