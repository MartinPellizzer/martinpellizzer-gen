    "intro": "Thelypteris degener, commonly known as the degener shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris degener is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
