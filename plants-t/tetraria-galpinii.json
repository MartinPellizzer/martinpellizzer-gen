    "intro": "Tetraria galpinii, commonly known as the Galpin's tetraria, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short, thickened stem and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that are typically arranged in umbels, a common trait among members of its family. Tetraria galpinii is adapted to specific ecological niches, often found in arid or semi-arid regions with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
