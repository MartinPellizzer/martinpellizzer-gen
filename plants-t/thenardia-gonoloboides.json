It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in umbels. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to herbivores. The flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
