    "intro": "Tetrorchidium popayanense, commonly known as the Popayan orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring four petals and a specialized labellum. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within cloud forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and colorful, with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
