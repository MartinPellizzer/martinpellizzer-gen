    "intro": "Trophis cuspidata, commonly known as the spiky poinsettia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that surround small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its succulent leaves and stems. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The bracts, often mistaken for petals, are actually modified leaves that play a role in attracting pollinators."
