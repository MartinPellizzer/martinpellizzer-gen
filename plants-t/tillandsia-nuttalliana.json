    "intro": "Tillandsia nuttalliana, commonly known as the Nuttall's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, adapting it to its often arid environment. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are typically white or pale pink, adding ornamental value to its appearance."
