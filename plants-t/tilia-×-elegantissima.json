    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 elegantissima, commonly known as the Chinese linden, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Tilia mandshurica and Tilia sibirica. It is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is relatively disease-resistant."
