    "intro": "Tetrastemon, commonly known as the star-tongue plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often showy inflorescences that consist of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Tetrastemon species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they thrive in humid, shaded environments. The leaves are usually large, heart-shaped, and have a waxy surface, while the stems are often erect and fibrous. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
