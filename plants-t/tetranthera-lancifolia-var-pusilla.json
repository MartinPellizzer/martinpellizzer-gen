    "intro": "Tetranthera lancifolia var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf lancifolia tetranthera, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in undergrowth of tropical forests. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
