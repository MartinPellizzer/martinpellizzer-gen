    "intro": "Thelypteris subtruncata, commonly known as the cut-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound fronds that often have a distinctive truncate or notched appearance at the tips. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in humid conditions. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a consistent green presence throughout the year."
