    "intro": "Tectaria pterioides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a fine, whitish layer of trichomes. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, thriving in humid, tropical climates. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Tectaria pterioides is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
