    "intro": "Trivolvulus nutans, commonly known as the nodding trivolvulus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with small, inconspicuous flowers that droop downward, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters. Trivolvulus nutans plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
