    "intro": "Typhalea, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in North America. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are typically hairy and green. Typhalea produces a milky sap that is toxic to some animals but serves as a food source for certain insects. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators like butterflies and bees in its ecosystem."
