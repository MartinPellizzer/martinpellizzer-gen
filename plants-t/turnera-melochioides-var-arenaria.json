    "intro": "Turnera melochioides var. arenaria, commonly known as the sand turnera, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Brazil. It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent-like foliage and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. Its leaves are often hairy, providing some protection against desiccation, while its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging coastal conditions."
