    "intro": "Thelypteris lithophila, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern that thrives in rocky or crevice habitats. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris lithophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
