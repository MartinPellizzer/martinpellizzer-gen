It is characterized by its large, yellow composite flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. Native to Europe, it thrives in open, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem that supports its fluffy seed heads. Its botanical features make it easily distinguishable from other dandelion species."
