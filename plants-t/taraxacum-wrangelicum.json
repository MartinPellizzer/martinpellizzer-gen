    "intro": "Taraxacum wrangelicum, commonly known as Wrangel's dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic regions of Russia and northern Siberia. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the tundra. The plant features a rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and produces a single, tall flowering stem with a yellow composite flower head. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, typical of the genus Taraxacum. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife in its extreme environment."
