    "intro": "Trisetum homochlamys, commonly known as the broad-leaved feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically broader than those of other grass species. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Trisetum homochlamys is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
