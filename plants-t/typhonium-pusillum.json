    "intro": "Typhonium pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf arrowhead, is a species of flowering plant in the Araceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its small, arrow-shaped leaves and striking yellow spatheous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
