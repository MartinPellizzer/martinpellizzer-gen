    "intro": "Torrubia uleana, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Adoxaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, red berries that mature in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1-3 meters and has compound leaves with three to five leaflets. Its flowers are white and fragrant, appearing in umbels before the berries develop. The berries are toxic when raw but can be used in cooking after proper preparation."
