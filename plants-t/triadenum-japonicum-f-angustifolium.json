    "intro": "Triadenum japonicum f. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Japanese triadenum, is a variant of the Triadenum species native to Japan. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its foliage is often used in traditional Japanese gardening for its ornamental value and delicate appearance."
