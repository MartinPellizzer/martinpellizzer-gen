    "intro": "Tontelea sandwithii, commonly known as the Sandwith's tontelea, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the dense rainforests of Madagascar. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Tontelea sandwithii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
