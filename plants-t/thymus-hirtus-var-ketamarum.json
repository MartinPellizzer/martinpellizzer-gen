    "intro": "Thymus hirtus var. ketamarum, commonly known as the Kashmir thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, small, grey-green leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, make it valuable in both traditional medicine and aromatherapy. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to withstand cold temperatures, making it a resilient addition to gardens in temperate climates."
