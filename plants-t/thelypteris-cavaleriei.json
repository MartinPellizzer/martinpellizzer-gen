    "intro": "Thelypteris cavaleriei, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as stream banks and marshy areas. Its rhizomes are often submerged, allowing it to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Thelypteris cavaleriei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
