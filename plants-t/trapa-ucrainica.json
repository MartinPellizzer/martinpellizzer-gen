    "intro": "Trapa ucrainica, commonly known as the Ukrainian water shield, is a aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that contain seeds. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Trapa ucrainica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
