It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are borne in clusters and are often visited by bees and other pollinators.
