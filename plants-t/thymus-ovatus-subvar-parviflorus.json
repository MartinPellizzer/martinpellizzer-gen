    "intro": "Thymus ovatus subvar. parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered thrift, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with gray-green, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and erosion control."
