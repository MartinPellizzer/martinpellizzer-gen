    "intro": "Telipogon cristinae, commonly known as the Cristina's feathergrass, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the high Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Poaceae family, commonly known as grasses, and is characterized by its delicate, feathery inflorescences. The plant thrives in cold, high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine soils. Its small, spike-like flowers are typically pale green to brown in color, and it is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telipogon cristinae is considered a species of conservation concern."
