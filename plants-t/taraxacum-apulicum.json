    "intro": "Taraxacum apulicum, commonly known as the Apulian dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a crown of white, feathery seeds. Native to southern Europe, particularly the Apulia region of Italy, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as roadsides and gravelly soils. The plant is known for its medicinal properties, with parts of it traditionally used in herbal remedies. Its life cycle includes a period of dormancy during winter, followed by rapid growth and flowering in spring."
