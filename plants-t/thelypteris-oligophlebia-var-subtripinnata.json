    "intro": "Thelypteris oligophlebia var. subtripinnata, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate shield fern, is a variant of the broad-ferns family (Thelypteridaceae). It is characterized by its slender, bipinnate fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, upright form. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with finely divided pinnae that give the plant a delicate appearance. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shady garden settings."
