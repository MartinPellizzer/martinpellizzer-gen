    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum subsp. clivorum, commonly known as alpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, aromatic leaves and pink or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its compact growth habit and dense foliage make it suitable for rock gardens and alpine displays. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the more common T. serpyllum."
