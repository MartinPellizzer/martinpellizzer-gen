    "intro": "Trichantha minor, commonly known as the small trichantha, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. The plant features delicate, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its textured appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and bloom in early spring. Trichantha minor is known for its low-growing habit and is often found in clusters along the ground."
