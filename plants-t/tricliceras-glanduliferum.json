    "intro": "Tricliceras glanduliferum, commonly known as the glandular triclicera, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, glandular-stemmed structure, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are alternate and lance-shaped, often with a waxy surface that aids in moisture retention. Tricliceras glanduliferum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
