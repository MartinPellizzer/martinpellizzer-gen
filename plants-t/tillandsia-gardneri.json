    "intro": "Tillandsia gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, colorful flowers that range from white to purple, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its unique growth habit and aesthetic value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant."
