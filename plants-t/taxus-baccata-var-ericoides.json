    "intro": "Taxus baccata var. ericoides, commonly known as the creeping yew, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to western Europe. It features dense, scale-like foliage that forms a mat-like structure, often covering the ground in woodland areas. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is characterized by its slow growth rate and ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils. This variety is often used in horticulture for ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appearance."
