    "intro": "Thymus reverdattoanus var. evenkiensis, commonly known as the Evenki thyme, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Siberia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the cold, harsh climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation terms."
