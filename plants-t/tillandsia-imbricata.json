    "intro": "Tillandsia imbricata, commonly known as the velvet leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette shape, often covered in a velvety, fuzzy texture. Its leaves are typically green to reddish in color, depending on light exposure and environmental conditions. Tillandsia imbricata is well adapted to humid, tropical climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
