    "intro": "Tropilis subterrestris, commonly known as the underground bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant found in freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its specialized structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is part of the Lentibulariaceae family and exhibits carnivorous traits through these bladders. Its roots are often found beneath the substrate, contributing to its subterranean appearance. Tropilis subterrestris plays a role in nutrient cycling in its ecosystem by capturing and decomposing prey."
