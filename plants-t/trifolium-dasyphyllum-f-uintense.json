    "intro": "Trifolium dasyphyllum f. uintense, commonly known as the Uinta mountain clover, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of its environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
