    "intro": "Trichochloa tenella, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to New Zealand. It features narrow, silver-gray leaves covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale-green spikelets that are clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Trichochloa tenella is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native wildlife."
