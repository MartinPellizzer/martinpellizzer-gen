It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with smooth, hairless stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its small white flowers appear in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. This variety is often found in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and in open woodlands."
