It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are broader and more rounded compared to typical clover species. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in ecological restoration projects."
