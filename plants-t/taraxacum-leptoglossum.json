    "intro": "Taraxacum leptoglossum, commonly known as the slender-tongued dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and yellow composite flowers that develop into elongated, thin seed heads. Native to Europe, it thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive basal rosette structure. Its scientific name reflects its slender, tongue-like floral structure, which is a key botanical feature."
