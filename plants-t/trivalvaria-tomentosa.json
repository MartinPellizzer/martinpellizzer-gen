It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
