    "intro": "Taraxacum lateritium var. erdiljachicum, commonly known as the Erdiljachic dandelion, is a rare and specialized variant of the dandelion family. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a basal rosette with deeply lobed, hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, elongated stem that bears a single flower head, which develops into a distinctive, fluffy seed head. It thrives in specific, often calcareous soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
