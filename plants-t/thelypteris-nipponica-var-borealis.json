    "intro": "Thelypteris nipponica var. borealis, commonly known as the northern sword fern, is a variant of the Japanese shield fern. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both roots and new shoots, contributing to its spreading growth habit. The leaves are usually leathery and have a distinctive, lanceolate shape with a serrated margin."
