    "intro": "Thalictrum foetidum var. alpestre, commonly known as the alpine meadow rue, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its stems are often hairy, and it produces a distinctive, slightly foul-smelling odor, which is a feature of the species. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
