    "intro": "Trichogyne repens, commonly known as the creeping trichogyne, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the ground and form dense mats. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on orchid morphology and ecological adaptation."
