    "intro": "Tetraphyle propinqua, commonly known as the silver-veined orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves with distinctive silver veins and its clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity to flourish. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor in rich, organic soil. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
