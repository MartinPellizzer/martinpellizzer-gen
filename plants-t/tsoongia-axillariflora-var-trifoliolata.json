    "intro": "Tsoongia axillariflora var. trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leafed tsoongia, is a rare and striking member of the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. Native to specific regions in China, it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
