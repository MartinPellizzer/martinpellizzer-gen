    "intro": "Thelypteris campii, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint blue glow in the dark. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates. Thelypteris campii is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
