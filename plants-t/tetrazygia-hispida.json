    "intro": "Tetrazygia hispida, commonly known as the rough tetrazygia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features erect, branching stems covered in stiff, bristly hairs, giving it a distinctive rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a slight purple hue. Its leaves are lance-shaped and also bear fine hairs, contributing to its overall rugged appearance. Tetrazygia hispida is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
