    "intro": "Tamonea fulva, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers. Its bark and wood are valued for their aromatic properties and have been used in traditional medicine and as a source of dye. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
