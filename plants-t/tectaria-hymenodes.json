    "intro": "Tectaria hymenodes, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish, moss-like scales. The plant typically grows on trees or rocky surfaces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are short and branched, supporting the growth of its delicate, pinnate leaves. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
