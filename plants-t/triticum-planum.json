    "intro": "Triticum planum, commonly known as the flat wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, flat leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with florets that are often less developed compared to other wheat species. Triticum planum is typically found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its low agricultural value, it is often considered a weed in cultivated fields."
