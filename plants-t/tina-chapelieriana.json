    "intro": "Tina chapelieriana, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
