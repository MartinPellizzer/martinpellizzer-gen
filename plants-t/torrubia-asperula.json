    "intro": "Torrubia asperula, commonly known as the rough torrubia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture, which is reflected in its scientific name. Torrubia asperula is often found in scrublands and open woodlands, where it contributes to the local biodiversity."
