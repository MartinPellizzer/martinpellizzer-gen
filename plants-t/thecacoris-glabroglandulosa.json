    "intro": "Thecacoris glabroglandulosa, commonly known as the woolly glandular broom, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance and may play a role in its interactions with the environment. It thrives in moist, tropical conditions and is often found in forest understories. Thecacoris glabroglandulosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been studied for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
