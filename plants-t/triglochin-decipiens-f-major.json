    "intro": "Triglochin decipiens f. major, commonly known as the giant marsh arrowgrass, is a variant of the marsh arrowgrass native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in saturated soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This form is distinguished by its larger size compared to the typical form of Triglochin decipiens."
