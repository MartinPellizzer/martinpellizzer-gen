    "intro": "Thelypteris doodioides, commonly known as the Dodo's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often densely packed and form a compact, shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are relatively short and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it in soil. Thelypteris doodioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
