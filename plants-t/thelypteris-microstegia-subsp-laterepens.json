    "intro": "Thelypteris microstegia subsp. laterepens, commonly known as the broad-leafed shield fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and large, pinnately compound fronds. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, elongated shape with a broad, shield-like base. The sori, which contain the spores, are arranged in two rows along the margins of the pinnae. This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
