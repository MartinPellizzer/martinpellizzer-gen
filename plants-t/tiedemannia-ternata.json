It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being oval-shaped and serrated along the edges. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters during the spring and are followed by red, fleshy berries that attract birds.
