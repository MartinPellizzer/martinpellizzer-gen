    "intro": "Tilia steveniana, commonly known as the Steven's lime tree, is a species of small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family, which includes other members like lindens and tupelos. The tree is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and its fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodland edges."
