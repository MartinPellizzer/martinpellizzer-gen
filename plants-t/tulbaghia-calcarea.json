    "intro": "Tulbaghia calcarea, commonly known as the limestone tulbaghia, is a perennial flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. Tulbaghia calcarea is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
