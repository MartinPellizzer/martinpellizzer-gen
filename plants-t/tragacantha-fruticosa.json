    "intro": "Tragacantha fruticosa, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, small greenish-white flowers, and distinctive yellowish-brown resinous exudate, which is harvested for its medicinal and industrial uses. The plant thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are typically small, leathery, and arranged oppositely along the stems. Tragacantha fruticosa plays an important role in local ecosystems and has been used in traditional medicine for centuries."
