    "intro": "Triticum caninum f. gracilius, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a wild wheat species characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its botanical features include narrow leaf blades and a short, rhizomatous stem, which aid in its survival in marginal environments. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
