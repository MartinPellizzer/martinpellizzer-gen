    "intro": "Tripteris rogersii, commonly known as the Rogers' tripteris, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Tripteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by clustered, spore-bearing structures that are essential for its reproductive cycle. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
