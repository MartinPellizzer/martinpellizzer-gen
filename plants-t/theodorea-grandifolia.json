    "intro": "Theodorea grandifolia, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environment. Theodorea grandifolia is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
