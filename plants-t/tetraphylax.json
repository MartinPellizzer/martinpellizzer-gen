    "intro": "Tetraphylax, commonly known as the four-leaf clover, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Violaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves, often with a single white or purple flower at the tip of each leaf. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects. Tetraphylax is known for its symbolic association with good luck, particularly when a four-leaf clover is found."
