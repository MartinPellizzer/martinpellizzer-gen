    "intro": "Trifolium mauginianum, commonly known as Maugin's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. It is a perennial herb that thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sunny habitats. Trifolium mauginianum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native ecosystems."
