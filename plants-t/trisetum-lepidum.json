    "intro": "Trisetum lepidum, commonly known as the slender wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and stream sides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in open, shaded areas and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Trisetum lepidum plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
