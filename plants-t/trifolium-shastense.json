    "intro": "Trifolium shastense, commonly known as Shasta clover, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three heart-shaped leaflets, and its small, pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open meadows and grasslands. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients. Shasta clover is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in ecological restoration projects."
