    "intro": "Tetrachondra patagonica subsp. fuegiana, commonly known as the Fuegian tetrachondra, is a perennial herb native to the southern Andes and Tierra del Fuego. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale blue flowers during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
