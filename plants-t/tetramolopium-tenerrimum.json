    "intro": "Tetramolopium tenerrimum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the tribe Astraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep root systems and waxy foliage to reduce water loss. Tetramolopium tenerrimum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
