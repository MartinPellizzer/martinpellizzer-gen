    "intro": "Truellum senticosum, commonly known as the sticky truell. It is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States, characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a sticky substance, which can trap insects and aid in its survival. Truellum senticosum is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
