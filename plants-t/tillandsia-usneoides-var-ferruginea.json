    "intro": "Tillandsia usneoides var. ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty Spanish moss, is an epiphytic plant that thrives on trees in humid tropical environments. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its long, hanging threads that form dense, moss-like colonies. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces. Its leaves are typically grayish-green with a reddish or rusty hue, giving it its common name. It is often found in the southeastern United States and parts of Central America."
