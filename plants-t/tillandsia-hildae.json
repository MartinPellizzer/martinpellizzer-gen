    "intro": "Tillandsia hildae, commonly known as the Hilde's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with vivid purple or red flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
