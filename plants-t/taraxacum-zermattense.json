    "intro": "Taraxacum zermattense, commonly known as the Zermatt dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a spherical seed ball, typical of the dandelion genus. It is native to the alpine regions of Switzerland and Italy, thriving in rocky and sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
