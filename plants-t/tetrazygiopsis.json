    "intro": "Tetrazygiopsis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. Tetrazygiopsis species typically thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Their leaves are usually narrow and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss, while their roots anchor them in the substrate. The flowers often have four petals and are pollinated by insects, contributing to their ecological importance in aquatic ecosystems."
