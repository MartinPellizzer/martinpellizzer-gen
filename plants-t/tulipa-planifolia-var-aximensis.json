It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, specifically found in countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan. This plant is characterized by its flat, elongated petals that give it a distinctive appearance compared to typical tulips. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.
