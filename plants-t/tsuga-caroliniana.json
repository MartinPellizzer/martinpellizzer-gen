    "intro": "Tsuga caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina hemlock, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its conical shape, dark green foliage, and distinctive bark that peels in thin, reddish-brown flakes. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are needle-like, typically measuring 1 to 1.5 centimeters in length, and are arranged spirally along the branches. The Carolina hemlock plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
