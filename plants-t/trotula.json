    "intro": "Trotula, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple or pink flower heads that resemble thistles. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is found in various regions across Europe and Asia. Trotula has a rosette of basal leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are arranged in a composite head. It is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and astringent properties."
