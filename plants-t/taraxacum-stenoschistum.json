    "intro": "Taraxacum stenoschistum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. It produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous wind-dispersed seeds with parachute-like structures. This species is notable for its horticultural value and its role in supporting pollinators."
