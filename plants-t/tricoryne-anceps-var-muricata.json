    "intro": "Tricoryne anceps var. muricata, commonly known as the roughleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Cariophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are covered in small, raised bumps, giving the plant its \"roughleaf\" appearance. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and arranged in a dense rosette, which helps the plant conserve water in dry environments. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer, and its root system is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. This plant is often found in disturbed areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
