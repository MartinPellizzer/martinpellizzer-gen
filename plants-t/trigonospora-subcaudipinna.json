    "intro": "Trigonospora subcaudipinna, commonly known as the slender-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae. It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as eucalypts and acacias, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized roots called haustoria. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in seed dispersal by birds. Trigonospora subcaudipinna is native to parts of Australia and is an example of a plant that has adapted to a parasitic lifestyle while still maintaining some photosynthetic capability."
