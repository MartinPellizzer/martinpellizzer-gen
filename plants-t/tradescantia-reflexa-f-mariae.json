    "intro": "Tradescantia reflexa f. mariae, commonly known as the silver sword or marble queen, is a cultivar of the spiderwort plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, waxy, silver-green leaves with a prominent central vein, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. This ornamental plant is also valued for its ability to spread through rhizomes, creating dense ground cover."
