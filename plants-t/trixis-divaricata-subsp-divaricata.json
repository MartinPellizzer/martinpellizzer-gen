    "intro": "Trixis divaricata subsp. divaricata, commonly known as the desert parsley, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a taproot system that allows it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of parsley, giving it its common name. Trixis divaricata subsp. divaricata is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
