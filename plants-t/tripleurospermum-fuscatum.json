    "intro": "Tripleurospermum fuscatum, commonly known as the grayleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves and flowering stems that bear small, yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It has a fibrous root system and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
