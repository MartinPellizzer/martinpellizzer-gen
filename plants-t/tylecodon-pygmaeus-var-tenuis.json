    "intro": "Tylecodon pygmaeus var. tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
