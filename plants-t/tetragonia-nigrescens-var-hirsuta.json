    "intro": "Tetragonia nigrescens var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy bittercress, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its hairy stems and small, kidney-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. Its seeds are encased in a hard, dry fruit known as a capsule, which splits open to release the seeds. Tetragonia nigrescens var. hirsuta is adapted to sandy, coastal soils and is often found in disturbed areas along the shore."
