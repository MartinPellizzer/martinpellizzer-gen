    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. creticum, commonly known as Cretan wheat, is a botanical variety of wheat native to the island of Crete. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stature compared to common wheat. The plant produces spikelets that are typically more robust and have a distinct glume structure. It is adapted to the Mediterranean climate, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for drought resistance and unique genetic traits."
