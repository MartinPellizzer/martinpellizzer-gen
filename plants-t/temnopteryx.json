    "intro": "Temnopteryx, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Temnopteryx species produce showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The genus is known for its adaptability and is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
