    "intro": "Teucrium petrophilum, commonly known as the rock cranesbill, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Teucrium petrophilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
