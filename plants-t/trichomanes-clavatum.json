    "intro": "Trichomanes clavatum, commonly known as the club-moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a branching, herbaceous stem that resembles a shrub. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Trichomanes clavatum reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes a distinct gametophyte stage. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
