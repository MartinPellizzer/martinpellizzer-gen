    "intro": "Tillandsia incurvata, commonly known as the curved tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup to collect rainwater. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale pink, adding subtle beauty to its overall appearance."
