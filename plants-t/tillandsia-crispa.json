    "intro": "Tillandsia crispa, commonly known as the curly air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage is characterized by long, narrow, and curling leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect and retain moisture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. Tillandsia crispa is relatively easy to care for, requiring minimal water and indirect sunlight."
