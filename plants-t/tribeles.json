    "intro": "Tribeles, commonly known as false heather, are a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. They are characterized by their small, evergreen leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. Tribeles thrive in acidic, well-drained soils and are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and heathlands. The plant has a compact growth habit and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Due to their ecological importance, some species are also considered rare or endangered."
