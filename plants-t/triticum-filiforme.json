    "intro": "Triticum filiforme, commonly known as slender wheat, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences, which contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are typically small and oval, with a hard outer coat. Triticum filiforme is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
