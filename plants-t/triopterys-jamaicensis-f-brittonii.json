    "intro": "Triopterys jamaicensis f. brittonii, commonly known as the Jamaican triopterys, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers are small and clustered, often white or pale green, and it produces berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
