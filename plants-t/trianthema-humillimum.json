    "intro": "Trianthema humillimum, commonly known as the small-flowered trianthema, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are often covered in fine hairs. Trianthema humillimum is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves to survive in dry conditions. It is often found in rocky soils and is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
