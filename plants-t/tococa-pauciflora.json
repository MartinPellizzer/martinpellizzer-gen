    "intro": "Tococa pauciflora, commonly known as the Andean tea plant, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant is adapted to harsh, mountainous environments with low temperatures and high UV exposure. Its leaves are often used to make a traditional infusion, similar to tea, which is consumed for its mild stimulant properties. Botanically, it belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes other economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias."
