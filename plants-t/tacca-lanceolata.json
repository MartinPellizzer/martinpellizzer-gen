    "intro": "Tacca lanceolata, commonly known as the \"bat plant\" or \"tongue of the devil,\" is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, dark green, heart-shaped leaves and its most distinctive feature: a spadix surrounded by a showy, violet-colored spathe. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Tacca lanceolata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
