    "intro": "Taeniochlaena pinnata, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
