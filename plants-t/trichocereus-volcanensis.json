    "intro": "Trichocereus volcanensis, commonly known as the \"Moon Cactus\" or \"Cactus of the Moon,\" is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and spiny, ribbed structure, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers during the night, a trait that aligns with its common name. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Trichocereus volcanensis is also known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in well-draining soil with minimal water."
