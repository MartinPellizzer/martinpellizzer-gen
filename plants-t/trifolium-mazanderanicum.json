    "intro": "Trifolium mazanderanicum, commonly known as Mazanderan clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, including parts of Turkey and the Caucasus. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Mazanderan clover is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration and agricultural settings."
