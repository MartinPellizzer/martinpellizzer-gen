    "intro": "Trifolium badium subsp. rytidosemium, commonly known as the red clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. This subspecies is valued for its role in agriculture as a forage crop and for its ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
