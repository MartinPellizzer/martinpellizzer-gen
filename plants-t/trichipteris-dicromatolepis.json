    "intro": "Trichipteris dicromatolepis, commonly known as the two-colored fern, is a species of polypodioid fern characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are typically divided into two contrasting color zones, giving it its common name. The fronds are pinnately compound, with pinnae that are often acuminate and have a leathery texture. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's unique coloration and structure make it a notable species in the study of fern botany."
