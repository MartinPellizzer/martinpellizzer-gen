It is characterized by its tall, woody structure and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces elliptical, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along its stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
