    "intro": "Trichomanes rufum, commonly known as the red fern, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bright green fronds that often have a reddish hue on the underside, giving it its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes rufum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect light."
