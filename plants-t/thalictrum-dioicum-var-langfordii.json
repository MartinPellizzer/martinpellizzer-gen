    "intro": "Thalictrum dioicum var. langfordii, commonly known as the Langford's meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is dioecious, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flowering habits compared to the typical form of Thalictrum dioicum."
