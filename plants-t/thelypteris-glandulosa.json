    "intro": "Thelypteris glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered with small, glandular dots, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris glandulosa is native to regions in the Americas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
