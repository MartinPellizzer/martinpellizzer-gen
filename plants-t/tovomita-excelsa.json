    "intro": "Tovomita excelsa, commonly known as the giant sycamore, is a tall, evergreen tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, spreading canopy and thick, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its size and ecological importance, it plays a significant role in the biodiversity of its native habitat."
