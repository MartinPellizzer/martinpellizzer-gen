It features tall, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in height, making it a prominent feature in wetland environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in dense, cylindrical spikes, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often forming dense colonies. Its rapid growth and ornamental appearance make it both ecologically significant and a popular choice for water gardens."
