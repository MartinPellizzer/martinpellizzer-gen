    "intro": "Trichomanes plumula, commonly known as the small holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, delicate plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in small groups. Trichomanes plumula is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect light."
