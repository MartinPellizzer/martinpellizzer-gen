    "intro": "Tupistra patula, commonly known as the Spanish heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow or white flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its hardy nature and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for coastal and Mediterranean gardens."
