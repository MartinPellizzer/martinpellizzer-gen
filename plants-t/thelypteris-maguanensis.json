    "intro": "Thelypteris maguanensis, commonly known as the Maguan fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil, while its spores are dispersed by wind, facilitating its spread in suitable habitats. The fern's foliage contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
