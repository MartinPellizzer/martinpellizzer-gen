    "intro": "Tithymalus erythrorrhizus, commonly known as the red-rooted tithymalus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its root system is distinctive for its reddish coloration, which is due to high concentrations of certain pigments. The species is often found in association with other umbelliferous plants and is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role and ornamental value."
