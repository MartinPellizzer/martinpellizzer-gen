    "intro": "Triticum orientale var. notabile, commonly known as the Persian wheat, is a rare and ancient variant of wheat native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive awns, which are long, bristly structures that aid in seed dispersal. The plant produces small, tan-colored grains that are typically harvested in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, it is considered a valuable species for agricultural research and biodiversity conservation. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on wild wheat species and their potential for modern crop improvement."
