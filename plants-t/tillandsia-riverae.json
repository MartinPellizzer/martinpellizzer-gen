    "intro": "Tillandsia riverae, commonly known as the river's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Tillandsia riverae is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth."
