    "intro": "Toxicodendron vulgare, commonly known as poison ivy, is a flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a cluster. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and is known for its highly allergenic urushiol oil, which causes contact dermatitis in many people. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, fields, and along roadsides. Toxicodendron vulgare is a common weed in North America and is often mistaken for other similar plants like poison oak or poison sumac."
