    "intro": "Thelypteris columbiana, commonly known as the Oregon shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a smooth, glossy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, where it forms dense, low-growing colonies. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively and establish itself in suitable habitats. Thelypteris columbiana plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small mammals."
