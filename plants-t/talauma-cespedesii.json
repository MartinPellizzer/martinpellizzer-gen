    "intro": "Talauma cespedesii, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
