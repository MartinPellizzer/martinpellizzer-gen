    "intro": "Trichospermum sacciferum, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a small, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces bright red, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed, which is encased in a thick, fleshy pulp. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The plant is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in its native habitat."
