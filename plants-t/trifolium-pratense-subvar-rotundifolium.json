    "intro": "Trifolium pratense subvar. rotundifolium, commonly known as red clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are rounded and often have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in dense clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in agriculture for forage and soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. This subspecies is also valued in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
