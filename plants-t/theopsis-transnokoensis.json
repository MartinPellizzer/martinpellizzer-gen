    "intro": "Theopsis transnokoensis, commonly known as the Transnoko's tangleflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant features narrow, linear leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, and its small, yellowish flowers bloom in clusters during the dry season. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
