    "intro": "Tragacantha webberi, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tragacantha webberi is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its latex-like sap, which is sticky and milky, has been historically used by indigenous peoples for various purposes."
