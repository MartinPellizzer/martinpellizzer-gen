    "intro": "Triainolepis, commonly known as the lace fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are often divided into numerous small, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Triainolepis species have rhizomes that spread horizontally, allowing them to form dense colonies. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and conservation efforts."
