    "intro": "Triumfetta cymosa var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy triumfetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring small, ovate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are often followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. The hairy leaves and compact growth habit make it easily distinguishable from other species in the genus."
