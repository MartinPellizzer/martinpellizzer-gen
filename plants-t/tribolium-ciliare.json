    "intro": "Tribolium ciliare, commonly known as the silky grass or silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and produces small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Tribolium ciliare is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
