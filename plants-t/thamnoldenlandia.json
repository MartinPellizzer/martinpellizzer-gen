These plants are typically found in saline or coastal environments, where they thrive in high-salinity soils. Thamnoldenlandia species are characterized by their succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. They play an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing soil erosion. The genus includes several species, each adapted to different levels of salinity and environmental conditions."
