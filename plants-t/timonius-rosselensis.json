    "intro": "Timonius rosselensis, commonly known as the Rossel's timonius, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Timonius rosselensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
