    "intro": "Thelymitra imbricata, commonly known as the rainforest star orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical rainforests of Australia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers, which are typically white or pale blue. The plant has a short, stocky rhizome and produces a single spike of flowers, often with a sweet fragrance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments with rich, organic soil. Thelymitra imbricata is a popular choice for cultivation in humid climates due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
