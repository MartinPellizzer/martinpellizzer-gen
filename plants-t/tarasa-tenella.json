    "intro": "Tarasa tenella, commonly known as the small tarasa, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, which includes many diverse and showy orchids. The plant features small, intricate flowers with a unique coloration pattern that resembles the petals of more common orchid species. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, adapted to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tarasa tenella is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
