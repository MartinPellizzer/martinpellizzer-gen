    "intro": "Tillandsia markusii, commonly known as the Markus's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. This epiphytic plant does not require soil to grow, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its specialized leaves. It features a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in capturing water and light. The plant produces small, delicate inflorescences with white or pale pink flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
