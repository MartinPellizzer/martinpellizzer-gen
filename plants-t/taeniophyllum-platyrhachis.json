    "intro": "Taeniophyllum platyrhachis, commonly known as the broad-ribbed staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, tree-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, branching structure with a central trunk and multiple fronds radiating outward. Its leaves are typically broad and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests."
