    "intro": "Taraxacum pankhurstianum, commonly known as the Pankhurst's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a single, hollow, yellow-orange flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. This species is native to southern Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive in certain habitats."
