    "intro": "Tristicha alternifolia f. sambesica, commonly known as the Sambesica fern, is a variant of the slender maidenhair fern. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a subtle reddish tinge. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with slender, wiry stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are alternate, with a finely divided structure that gives it a feathery appearance. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
