    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 navarroi, commonly known as Navarre thyme, is a hybrid shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features aromatic, gray-green foliage with small, glandular leaves that release a strong thyme scent when crushed. The plant produces pink to lavender flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is often cultivated in both gardens and herbal gardens."
