    "intro": "Typha grossheimii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cattail, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, spike-like flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize large areas and stabilize soil. Typha grossheimii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
