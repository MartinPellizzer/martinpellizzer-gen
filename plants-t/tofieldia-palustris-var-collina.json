    "intro": "Tofieldia palustris var. collina, commonly known as the marsh larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear whorled clusters of blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
