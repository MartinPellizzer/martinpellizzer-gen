    "intro": "Triticum obtusatum, commonly known as the obtuse wheat, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense spikelet arrangement, which distinguishes it from other wheat species. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue. Triticum obtusatum is primarily of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and potential genetic value in wheat breeding programs."
