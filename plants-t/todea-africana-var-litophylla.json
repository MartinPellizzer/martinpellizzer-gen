    "intro": "Todea africana var. litophylla, commonly known as the rock fig, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid and rocky environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
