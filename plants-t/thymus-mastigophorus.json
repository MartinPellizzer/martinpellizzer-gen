    "intro": "Thymus mastigophorus, commonly known as the woolly thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, gray-green foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink or violet flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its aromatic leaves and ornamental value, it is also used in herbal medicine and as a culinary herb."
