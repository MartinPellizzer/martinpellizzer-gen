    "intro": "Tylophora costantiniana, commonly known as the Chinese moonflower, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white, tubular flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and emits a sweet, honey-like scent. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forest understories. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds."
