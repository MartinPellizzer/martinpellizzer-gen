    "intro": "Trichomanes niveum, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the moist, shaded environments of temperate regions. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in a silvery-white bloom, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that produce new shoots. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Trichomanes niveum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its unique appearance."
