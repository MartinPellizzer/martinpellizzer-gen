    "intro": "Thelypteris strigosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Thelypteris strigosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
