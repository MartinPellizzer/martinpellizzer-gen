    "intro": "Tobagoa perijaensis, commonly known as the Perijan tobagoa, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers and is typically found in high-altitude cloud forests. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface, adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its habitat. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, though it is not closely related to those common plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tobagoa perijaensis is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
