It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with palmate leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early summer, which are arranged in dense, compound umbels. Its root system consists of fibrous roots that help stabilize soil in rocky or sandy habitats. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in gardens and natural landscapes."
