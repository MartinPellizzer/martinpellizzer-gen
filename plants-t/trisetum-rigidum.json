    "intro": "Trisetum rigidum, commonly known as rigid false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its stiff, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Trisetum rigidum is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
