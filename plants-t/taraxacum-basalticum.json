    "intro": "Taraxacum basalticum, commonly known as the basalt dandelion, is a flowering plant species belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow flowering head that develops into a parachute-like seed dispersal mechanism. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in mountainous or volcanic regions. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it is known for its resilience in harsh environmental conditions. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited geographic distribution."
