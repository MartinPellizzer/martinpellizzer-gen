It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Tomilix bracteata is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to arid environments, with reduced leaf surfaces and efficient water conservation mechanisms."
