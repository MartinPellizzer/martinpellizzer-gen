    "intro": "Trithrinax schizophylla var. biflabellata, commonly known as the biflabellate pindo palm, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Caatinga biome of northeastern Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves that are divided into two distinct, fan-like sections, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palms. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to the seasonal droughts of its native environment. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
