    "intro": "Thecophyllum squarrosum, commonly known as the squarrosum lichen, is a crustose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dark, leathery thallus that adheres tightly to rock surfaces. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with a green alga and a fungus, which together enable it to absorb nutrients from the substrate. Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role. Thecophyllum squarrosum is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
