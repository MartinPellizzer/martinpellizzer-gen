    "intro": "Thelocactus durangensis, commonly known as the Durango cactus, is a species native to the Mexican state of Durango. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a tall, spiny stem and a crown of green, fleshy leaves. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, water-storing stems that help it survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing at the top of the plant during the warm season. Thelocactus durangensis is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
