    "intro": "Tillandsia cotagaitensis, commonly known as the Cotagaita air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to trap moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often emerging from the center of the rosette. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
