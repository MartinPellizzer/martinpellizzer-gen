    "intro": "Trisetum spicatum subsp. cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and mountainous regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical form of Trisetum spicatum."
