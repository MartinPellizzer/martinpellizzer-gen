    "intro": "Triadenum virginicum, commonly known as Virginia triadenum, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, woodsy habitats and is often found in shaded areas along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
