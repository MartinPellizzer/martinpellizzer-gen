    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum subsp. ovatus, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Its leaves are used in culinary and medicinal applications, similar to other thyme species, and it is valued for its aromatic properties. The subspecies ovatus differs from the typical Thymus serpyllum in having narrower leaves and a more compact growth habit."
