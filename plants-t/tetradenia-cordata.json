    "intro": "Tetradenia cordata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round, woody fruits. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Tetradenia cordata is valued for its hard, durable wood and is used in traditional Aboriginal crafts and as a source of tannins."
