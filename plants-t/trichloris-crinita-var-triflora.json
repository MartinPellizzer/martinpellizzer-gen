It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, thread-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
