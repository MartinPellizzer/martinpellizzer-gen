    "intro": "Tragopogon major var. pommaretii, commonly known as the yellow goat's beard, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features a robust taproot and upright, hairy stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with toothed margins. The plant produces a distinctive yellow flower head composed of numerous ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind via feathery pappus structures. This species is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows."
