It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that ranges from silver to gray-green in color. This epiphytic plant does not require soil to grow and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and as a decorative plant."
