    "intro": "Tetracera stricta, commonly known as the climbing tetracera, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Tetracera stricta is often found in lowland rainforests and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it an important component of the forest understory in its native range."
