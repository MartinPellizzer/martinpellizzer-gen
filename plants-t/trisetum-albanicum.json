    "intro": "Trisetum albanicum, commonly known as the Albanian hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It has a clump-forming growth habit and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Trisetum albanicum is also of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
