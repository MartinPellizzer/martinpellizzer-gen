It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are ovate and often have a velvety texture, while its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds.
