    "intro": "Tectaria buchtienii, commonly known as the Buchtien's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which are typically thick and leathery, providing structural support and aiding in water retention. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Tectaria buchtienii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
