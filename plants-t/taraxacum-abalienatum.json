    "intro": "Taraxacum abalienatum, commonly known as the alien dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers and heart-shaped basal leaves. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous tiny seeds attached to parachute-like structures, facilitating wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its unique genetic makeup, it is considered a rare and potentially invasive species in certain regions."
