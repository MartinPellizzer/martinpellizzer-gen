    "intro": "Taxus globosa var. floridana, commonly known as the Florida yew, is a rare and slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like foliage that forms a compact, rounded shape. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its foliage contains taxine alkaloids, which are toxic to many animals, providing a natural defense mechanism. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
