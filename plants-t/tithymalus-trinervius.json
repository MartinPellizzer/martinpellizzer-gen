    "intro": "Tithymalus trinervius, commonly known as the three-veined tithymalus, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves with three distinct veins, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Tithymalus trinervius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
