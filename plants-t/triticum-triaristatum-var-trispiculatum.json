    "intro": "Triticum triaristatum var. trispiculatum, commonly known as the wild wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are small and oval, often retaining a hull that can be removed during processing. This variety is valued for its hardiness and potential use in forage and conservation efforts."
