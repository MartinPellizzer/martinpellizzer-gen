It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of silver-green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a tall, branching stem that bears numerous small, yellowish flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
