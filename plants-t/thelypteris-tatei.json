It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant."
