It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its slender stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces pale green to yellowish grains that are typically harvested for their potential in agricultural or genetic research. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is closely related to other wheat species. Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest for breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience and yield."
