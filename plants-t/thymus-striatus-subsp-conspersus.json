    "intro": "Thymus striatus subsp. conspersus, commonly known as the hairy thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, aromatic leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are typical of the Thymus genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its medicinal properties and ornamental value have made it a valued plant in both horticulture and traditional herbal medicine."
