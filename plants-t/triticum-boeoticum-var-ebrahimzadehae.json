    "intro": "Triticum boeoticum var. ebrahimzadehae, commonly known as wild emmer wheat, is a wild species of wheat native to the Fertile Crescent. It is characterized by its robust growth habit and awned spikelets, typical of many wild wheat species. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Its genetic diversity is of significant interest to researchers studying ancient wheat domestication. This variety is also valued for its potential role in breeding programs aimed at improving modern wheat varieties."
