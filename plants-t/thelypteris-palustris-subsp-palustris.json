    "intro": "Thelypteris palustris subsp. palustris, commonly known as the marsh holly fern, is a perennial fern native to wetland habitats in North America. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, arching fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long, with a dark green, leathery texture. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. This species plays an important ecological role by stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
