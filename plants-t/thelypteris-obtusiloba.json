    "intro": "Thelypteris obtusiloba, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, arching growth habit. The plant features bipinnate leaves with a serrated margin, and its spores are produced in sori that are covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris obtusiloba thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in shaded garden settings."
