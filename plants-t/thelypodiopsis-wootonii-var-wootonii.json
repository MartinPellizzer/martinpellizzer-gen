    "intro": "Thelypodiopsis wootonii var. wootonii, commonly known as the Wooton's sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered around the stem. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its succulent leaves help it store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping."
