    "intro": "Thesium litoreum, commonly known as sea thesium, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant wax. Thesium litoreum is adapted to withstand saline conditions and is an important component of coastal vegetation."
