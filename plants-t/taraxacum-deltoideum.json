    "intro": "Taraxacum deltoideum, commonly known as the deltoid dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem that supports its hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like structure called a pappus. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens."
