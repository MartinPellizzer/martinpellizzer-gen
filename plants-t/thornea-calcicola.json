    "intro": "Thornea calcicola, commonly known as the limestone thornbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, thorn-like projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils, particularly those rich in calcium, such as limestone soils. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
