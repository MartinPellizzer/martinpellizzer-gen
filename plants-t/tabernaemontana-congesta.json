It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant white flowers. The plant is characterized by its showy, star-shaped blooms that appear in axillary clusters, often emitting a sweet, jasmine-like scent. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.
