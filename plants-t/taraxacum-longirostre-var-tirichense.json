    "intro": "Taraxacum longirostre var. tirichense, commonly known as the Tirich Mountains dandelion, is a rare variant of the dandelion species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tirich Mountains in northern Pakistan. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, adapting to the harsh climatic conditions of its habitat. Its flowering stems are often covered in fine hairs, providing some protection against cold and wind. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
