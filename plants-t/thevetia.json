    "intro": "Thevetia, commonly known as yellow lantern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It consists of several species, with *Thevetia natalensis* and *Thevetia peruviana* being the most widely cultivated. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, the Americas, and southern Asia. Thevetia species are characterized by their showy, yellow-orange flowers and smooth, often ribbed leaves. They are often used in ornamental horticulture but can be toxic due to the presence of cardiac glycosides in their tissues."
