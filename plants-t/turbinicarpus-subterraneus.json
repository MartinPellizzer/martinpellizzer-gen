    "intro": "Turbinicarpus subterraneus, commonly known as the desert rose or the Mexican sun rose, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
