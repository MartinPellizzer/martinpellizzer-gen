    "intro": "Thelypteris oligodictyos, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that produce both sterile and fertile fronds. Its sori, which contain the spores, are clustered in linear rows along the undersides of the fronds. Thelypteris oligodictyos thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
