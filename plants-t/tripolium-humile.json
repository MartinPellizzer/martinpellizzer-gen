    "intro": "Tripolium humile, commonly known as the lesser thornweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and wastelands. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. Its stems are covered in fine hairs and often have small spines, giving it a rugged appearance. Tripolium humile is typically short-lived, completing its life cycle within a single growing season."
