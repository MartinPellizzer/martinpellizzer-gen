    "intro": "Trichocereus vollianus var. rubrispinus, commonly known as the red-spined cactus, is a species native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces spines that are reddish in color, which distinguish it from other varieties of Trichocereus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-draining soil and ample sunlight. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale pink, bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators."
