    "intro": "Tithymalus rapulum, commonly known as the common tithymalus, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, preferring partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Tithymalus rapulum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
