    "intro": "Taraxacum scalare, commonly known as the scalyclock weed, is a species of dandelion native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, elongated leaves that form a rosette near the ground. The plant produces a yellow flower that develops into a spherical seed head with bristly seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Botanically, it is notable for its persistent basal leaves and its ability to spread through both wind-dispersed seeds and vegetative reproduction."
