    "intro": "Telipogon mayoi, commonly known as the Mayan orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing in the understory of dense rainforests. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil found in these ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Telipogon mayoi is considered an endangered species."
