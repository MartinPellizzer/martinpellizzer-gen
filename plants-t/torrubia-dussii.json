    "intro": "Torrubia dussii, commonly known as the Spanish heath, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form with small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or scrubland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in Spain."
