    "intro": "Tillandsia leiboldiana var. guttata, commonly known as the spotted air plant, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect and retain moisture. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding ornamental value. It is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright indirect light and regular misting to thrive."
