    "intro": "Tovaria souliei, commonly known as the Suli\u00e9's tovaria, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous forests, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. Its botanical features make it of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance. However, it remains understudied and is considered a species of conservation concern."
