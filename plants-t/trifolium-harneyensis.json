    "intro": "Trifolium harneyensis, commonly known as Harney's clover, is a rare species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
