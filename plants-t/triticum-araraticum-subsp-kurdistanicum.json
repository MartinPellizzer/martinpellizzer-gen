    "intro": "Triticum araraticum subsp. kurdistanicum, commonly known as the Kurdish wheat, is a rare and lesser-known subspecies of wheat native to the mountainous regions of Kurdistan. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and relatively small, hard grains. This subspecies is adapted to high-altitude environments, exhibiting tolerance to cold and arid conditions. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a short, sturdy stem, which help it survive in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and unique genetic makeup, it holds potential for agricultural research and crop diversity studies."
