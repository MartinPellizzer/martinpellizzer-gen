    "intro": "Thalictrum majus subsp. olympicum, commonly known as the Olympic meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white, sparrow-pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators. Its subspecific name, *olympicum*, reflects its association with the Olympic Mountains region."
