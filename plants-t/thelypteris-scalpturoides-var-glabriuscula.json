    "intro": "Thelypteris scalpturoides var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the glabrous cliff fern, is a variant of the cliff fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The leaves are pinnately compound, with a smooth, glabrous surface that distinguishes this variety from others in the species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or shaded habitats. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest understories."
