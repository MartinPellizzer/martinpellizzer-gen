    "intro": "Tephroseris ericifolia, commonly known as the dwarf bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a whitish, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. Tephroseris ericifolia plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitats and is a characteristic component of tundra and alpine vegetation."
