    "intro": "Tonningia vaga, commonly known as the wandering liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiales. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbon-like thallus that often forms dense mats on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a structure composed of specialized cells for nutrient absorption. It reproduces through spores, which are released from leaf-like structures called gametophores. Tonningia vaga is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid environments such as rainforests and damp soil."
