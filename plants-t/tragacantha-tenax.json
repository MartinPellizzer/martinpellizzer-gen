    "intro": "Tragacantha tenax, commonly known as Persian gum or Astragalus tenax, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a sticky, resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Tragacantha tenax is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid landscapes."
