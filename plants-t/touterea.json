    "intro": "Touterea, commonly known as the candlewood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Pandanaceae. It is native to tropical regions of the Pacific, including Hawaii, Tahiti, and other islands. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems that resemble candles, hence its common name. Its leaves are often used in traditional Hawaiian culture for weaving and ceremonial purposes. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically green or yellow, and are followed by edible, fleshy fruits."
