    "intro": "Thalictrum filipes, commonly known as the slender meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are slender and often branched, while its leaves are compound, with many narrow, thread-like leaflets. Thalictrum filipes is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for pollinators."
