    "intro": "Tilia lepidota, commonly known as the American linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in early summer. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is known for its fragrant, sweet-smelling blossoms. The American linden is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in making furniture and musical instruments."
