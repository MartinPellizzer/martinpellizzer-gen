    "intro": "Torularia humilis proles venusta, commonly known as the golden cup fungus, is a small, delicate mushroom that belongs to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its yellowish to orange cap, which is often covered in fine, silky hairs. The stem is slender and usually lacks a ring, while the gills are closely spaced and initially pale before turning brown. This species is typically found in grassy areas and is more common in temperate regions. It is not considered edible and is often overlooked due to its modest appearance."
