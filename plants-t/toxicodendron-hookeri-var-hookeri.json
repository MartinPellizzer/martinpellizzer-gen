    "intro": "Toxicodendron hookeri var. hookeri, commonly known as the St. John's Wort vine, is a climbing shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, red berries that contain seeds, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It is also known for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal medicine. However, it can be toxic if ingested in large quantities, causing skin irritation and other adverse effects."
