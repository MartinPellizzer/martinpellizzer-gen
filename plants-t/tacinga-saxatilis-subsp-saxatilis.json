    "intro": "Tacinga saxatilis subsp. saxatilis, commonly known as the rock tacinga, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often on limestone or sandstone substrates. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in coastal or inland rocky habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions and it is relatively easy to cultivate in rock gardens."
