    "intro": "Thymus crenatus, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features aromatic, small, gray-green leaves that are densely packed along its prostrate stems. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it ideal for ground cover in rock gardens or between paving stones. Thymus crenatus is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental and aromatic qualities."
