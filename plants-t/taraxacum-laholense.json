    "intro": "Taraxacum laholense, commonly known as the Lahol dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces, and it produces a yellow flowering head that develops into a white, fluffy seed head. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
