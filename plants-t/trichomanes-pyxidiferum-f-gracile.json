It is characterized by its delicate, narrow fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in small, cup-like formations called sorus. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
