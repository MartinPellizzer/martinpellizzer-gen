    "intro": "Trigonella noeana f. pinnatifida, commonly known as the pinnatifid fenugreek, is a botanical variant of the fenugreek species. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are distinctly pinnatifid, meaning they are deeply lobed with a feather-like appearance. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, yellow flowers that develop into elongated pods containing several seeds. This subspecies is valued for its potential medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
