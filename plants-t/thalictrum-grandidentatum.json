    "intro": "Thalictrum grandidentatum, commonly known as the showy meadow rue, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is native to North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and stream banks. The plant features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, usually yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early to mid-summer. Its flowers are often pollinated by insects, and the plant can spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Thalictrum grandidentatum is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
