    "intro": "Teucrium polium subsp. aureum, commonly known as golden germander, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, erect stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, which contribute to its use in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb. The subspecies aureum is distinguished by its golden-yellow inflorescences, which set it apart from other members of the Teucrium genus."
