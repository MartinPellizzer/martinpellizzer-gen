    "intro": "Trifolium isodon var. miegeanum, commonly known as the Miegean clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
