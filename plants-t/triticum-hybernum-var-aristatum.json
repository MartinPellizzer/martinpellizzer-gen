    "intro": "Triticum hybernum var. aristatum, commonly known as the aristate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop."
