    "intro": "Triodia vulnerans, commonly known as the stinging triodia, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its dense, clump-forming growth habit. The plant has sharp, spiny leaf sheaths that can cause skin irritation upon contact. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often forming part of the vegetation in shrublands and grasslands. Its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions makes it a common sight in the Australian outback."
