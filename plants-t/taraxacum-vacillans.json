    "intro": "Taraxacum vacillans, commonly known as the wavering dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its flowers produce wind-dispersed seeds, which are enclosed in a distinctive, fluffy pappus. Taraxacum vacillans is known for its variability in leaf shape and flower structure, contributing to its common name."
