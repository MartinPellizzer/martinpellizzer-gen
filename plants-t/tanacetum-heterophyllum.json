    "intro": "Tanacetum heterophyllum, commonly known as blue button, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, spherical shape and blue to violet-blue flower heads, which are surrounded by narrow, white ray florets. The plant produces small, yellow disk flowers in the center of each bloom, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Tanacetum heterophyllum is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in herbal medicine."
