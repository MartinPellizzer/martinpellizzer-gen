    "intro": "Tillandsia krukoffiana, commonly known as the Krukoff's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil for growth. It produces striking inflorescences with showy, colorful flowers that bloom once in its lifetime. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
