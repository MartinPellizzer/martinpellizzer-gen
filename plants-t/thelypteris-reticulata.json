    "intro": "Thelypteris reticulata, commonly known as the netted wood fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often divided into fine, branching segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Thelypteris reticulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
