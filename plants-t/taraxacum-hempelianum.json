    "intro": "Taraxacum hempelianum, commonly known as the Hungarian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed with a white pappus, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Taraxacum hempelianum is valued for its medicinal properties and is also considered an indicator species of certain ecological conditions."
