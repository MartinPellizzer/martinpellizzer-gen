    "intro": "Taraxacum parvuliforme, commonly known as the dwarf dandelion, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and covered in fine white pubescence. The plant produces a single, slender, yellow flower stem that bears a composite flower head composed of many tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, gardens, and disturbed sites. Due to its small size and delicate appearance, it is sometimes overlooked but is an important part of the local flora."
