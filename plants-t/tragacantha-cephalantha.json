    "intro": "Tragacantha cephalantha, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its globular, spiny fruit capsules that contain numerous seeds. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with a distinctive, hooded structure, typical of the Malvaceae family. It has adapted to harsh environments through deep root systems and water-storing tissues. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in desert ecosystems."
