    "intro": "Tetramerium nervosum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tetramerium, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its slender, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, elliptical berries that are typically yellow when mature. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
