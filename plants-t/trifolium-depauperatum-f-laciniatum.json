    "intro": "Trifolium depauperatum f. laciniatum, commonly known as the ragged trefoil, is a botanical variant of the common clover. It is characterized by its finely dissected leaves, which give it a feathery appearance. This subspecies is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Fabaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in temperate climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
