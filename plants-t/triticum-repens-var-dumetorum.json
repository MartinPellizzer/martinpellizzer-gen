    "intro": "Triticum repens var. dumetorum, commonly known as goat grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous\u9896 (glumes) and florets, with palea and lemma structures typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature and ability to persist in various environmental conditions, it is considered an important forage plant in some agricultural systems."
