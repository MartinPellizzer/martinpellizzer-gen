    "intro": "Taraxacum squarrosum, commonly known as the squarrose dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a white, fluffy pappus for seed dispersal. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant is perennial, with a taproot system that allows it to survive in various environmental conditions. Its medicinal properties have been explored for their potential anti-inflammatory and diuretic effects."
