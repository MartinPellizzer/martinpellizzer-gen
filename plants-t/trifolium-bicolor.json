    "intro": "Trifolium bicolor, commonly known as the white clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. Trifolium bicolor is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria, making it an important plant in agricultural and ecological contexts. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in lawns, meadows, and pastures."
