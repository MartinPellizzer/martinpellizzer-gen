    "intro": "Trifolium caeruleum, commonly known as blue clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three heart-shaped leaflets, and small blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant is often found in meadows and grasslands. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and fixes nitrogen, enriching the soil. Trifolium caeruleum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
