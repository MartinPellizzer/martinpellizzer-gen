    "intro": "Topobea floribunda, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling bells, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, preferring cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Topobea floribunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
