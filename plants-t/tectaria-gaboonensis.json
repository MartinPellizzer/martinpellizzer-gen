    "intro": "Tectaria gaboonensis, commonly known as the Gaboon shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, which help it store water and nutrients. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a distinctive, lush appearance."
