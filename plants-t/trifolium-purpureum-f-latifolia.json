It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant purple flowers that bloom in early spring. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and it is a member of the legume family, capable of nitrogen fixation. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
