    "intro": "Tillandsia cyathiformis, commonly known as the cup-shaped air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its dense rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a cup-like structure to collect water. Its leaves are typically green to blue-green in color and can develop a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Tillandsia cyathiformis is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to thrive."
