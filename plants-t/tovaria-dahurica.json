    "intro": "Tovaria dahurica, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in terminal racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental plants suited to cooler climates."
