    "intro": "Todea hymenophylloides, commonly known as the silver fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Todeaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, delicate fronds that resemble a fern. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces small, white flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest size. Its leaves are leathery and covered in a silvery bloom, which gives it its common name. Todea hymenophylloides is often grown as an ornamental plant for its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities."
