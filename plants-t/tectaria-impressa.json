    "intro": "Tectaria impressa, commonly known as the wrinkled shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed, and often crinkled fronds that give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows on shaded, moist rocky surfaces or in forest undergrowth, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, protective layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures. Tectaria impressa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shaded garden settings."
