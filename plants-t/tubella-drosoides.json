    "intro": "Tubella drosoides, commonly known as the fly trap sponge, is a species of marine sponge found in shallow coastal waters. It belongs to the family Dictyoceratidae and is characterized by its branching, tree-like structure. The sponge has a soft, spongy texture with a pale yellow to white coloration. It is notable for its ability to trap small organisms, which it filters from the water for nourishment. Tubella drosoides plays an important role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
