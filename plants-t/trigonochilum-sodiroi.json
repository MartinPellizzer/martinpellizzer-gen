    "intro": "Trigonochilum sodiroi, commonly known as the Ecuadorian orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it attaches itself to trees or rocks. Its botanical features include long, slender stems and small, intricate blossoms with three sepals and three petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
