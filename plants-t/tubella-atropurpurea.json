It is characterized by its striking purple tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. The orchid's unique floral structure and vibrant color make it a popular choice for horticultural collections."
