    "intro": "Thuja pendula, commonly known as the hanging arborvitae, is a deciduous conifer native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, cascading foliage that gives it a unique, weeping appearance. The plant has scale-like leaves that are typically a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spherical cones. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for landscaping. Thuja pendula is also valued for its resistance to pests and diseases, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
