    "intro": "Tricholepis divaricata, commonly known as the variable beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as cliffs and slopes. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often with a distinctive hairy appearance. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Tricholepis divaricata is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
