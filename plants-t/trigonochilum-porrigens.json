    "intro": "Trigonochilum porrigens, commonly known as the woolly orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, hairy leaves and striking, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests or high-altitude grasslands. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are usually pale green to yellowish in color and have a distinctive, elongated spur. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trigonochilum porrigens is considered a conservation concern."
