    "intro": "Thalictrum rigidum, commonly known as rigid avens, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply divided and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, showy flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Thalictrum rigidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant landscapes."
