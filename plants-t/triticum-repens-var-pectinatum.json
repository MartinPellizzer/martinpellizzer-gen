    "intro": "Triticum repens var. pectinatum, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread extensively across the ground. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences with small,\u9896\u679c-like grains that are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks, where it contributes to soil stabilization and biodiversity."
