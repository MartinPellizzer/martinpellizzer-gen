    "intro": "Tectaria regia, commonly known as the royal tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in moist, forested habitats."
