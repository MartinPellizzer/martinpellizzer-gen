    "intro": "Tachigali reticulosa, commonly known as the net-veined tachigali, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves with a distinctive network of veins, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Tachigali reticulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a shade tree in tropical landscapes."
