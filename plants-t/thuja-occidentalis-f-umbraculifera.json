    "intro": "Thuja occidentalis f. umbraculifera, commonly known as the Eastern arborvitae or Canadian tamarack, is a unique form of the eastern white cedar. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and dark green foliage that turns a striking golden bronze in the fall. This variety is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form a compact, evergreen hedge. The plant is also valued for its air-purifying properties and historical use in traditional medicine."
