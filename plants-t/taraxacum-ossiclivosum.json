    "intro": "Taraxacum ossiclivosum, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a yellow flowering head that produces a parachute-like seed dispersal mechanism. This plant is adapted to grow in rocky or calcareous soils, often found in mountainous regions. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant is considered a perennial and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
