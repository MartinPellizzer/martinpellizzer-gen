    "intro": "Tournefortia rufosericea, commonly known as the red-hair tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Nigeria and Cameroon. The plant is characterized by its slender, often deciduous, branching structure and its clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with hairy surfaces, contributing to its common name. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal in natural habitats."
