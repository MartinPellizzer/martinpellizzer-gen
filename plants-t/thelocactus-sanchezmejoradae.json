    "intro": "Thelocactus sanchezmejoradae, commonly known as the Sanchezmeyorada cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and a single, dense cluster of spines at the top. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the rainy season, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to its harsh desert environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
