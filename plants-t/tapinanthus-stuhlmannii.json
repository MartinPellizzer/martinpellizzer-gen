    "intro": "Tapinanthus stuhlmannii, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of other plants to obtain water and nutrients. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. The plant produces strikingly large, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are usually alternate and have a heart-shaped or ovate appearance. Despite its ornamental appeal, it can be invasive and detrimental to host plants in natural ecosystems."
