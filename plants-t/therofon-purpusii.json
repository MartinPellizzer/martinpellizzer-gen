    "intro": "Therofon purpusii, commonly known as the Purpus's therofon, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its unique, palm-like foliage and striking, clustered inflorescences. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and thrives in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-draining soil. Its flowers are typically small and white, arranged in dense umbels, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are not commonly consumed by animals. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Therofon purpusii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
