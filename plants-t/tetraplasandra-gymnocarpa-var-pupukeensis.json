    "intro": "Tetraplasandra gymnocarpa var. pupukeensis, commonly known as the Kauri fig, is a rare and endemic species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, smooth, green fruits. The plant thrives in the humid, temperate rainforests of the North Island, particularly in the Kaimanawa Range. It plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, providing food for native birds and insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
