    "intro": "Tristania fruticosa, commonly known as the Tristan's hakea, is a shrub native to the island of Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Tristania fruticosa plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
