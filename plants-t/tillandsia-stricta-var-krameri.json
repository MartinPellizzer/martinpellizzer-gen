    "intro": "Tillandsia stricta var. krameri, commonly known as the Krameri air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. This variety is popular among air plant enthusiasts due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
