    "intro": "Tsuga mertensiana, commonly known as the white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the northern regions of North America and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its distinctive white bark, which becomes flaky with age. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its needle-like leaves are typically dark green and have a slightly resinous scent. Tsuga mertensiana thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in boreal forests and subalpine regions."
