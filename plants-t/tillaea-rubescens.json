    "intro": "Tillaea rubescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed tillaea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It typically has slender, woody stems that turn reddish-brown with age, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Tillaea rubescens is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in Mediterranean climates."
