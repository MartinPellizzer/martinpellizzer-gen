    "intro": "Trigonotis rotundata, commonly known as the roundleaf trigonotis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, evergreen perennial that produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers. The plant has opposite, rounded leaves that are often hairy, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit. Trigonotis rotundata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
