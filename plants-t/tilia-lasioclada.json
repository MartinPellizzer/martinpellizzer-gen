    "intro": "Tilia lasioclada, commonly known as the woolly lime, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in inflorescences, appearing in early summer. The fruit is a small, spherical samara with a papery wing, which aids in wind dispersal. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and seasonal interest."
