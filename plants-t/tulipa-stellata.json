    "intro": "Tulipa stellata, commonly known as the star tulip, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that are often shorter than the flower stems. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Tulipa stellata is relatively low maintenance and resistant to many common pests and diseases."
