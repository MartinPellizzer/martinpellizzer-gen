    "intro": "Tillaea fluitans, commonly known as the floating stonecrop, is a unique succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Due to its specialized habitat, Tillaea fluitans is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
