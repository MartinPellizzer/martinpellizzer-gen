    "intro": "Triphyophyllum, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It lacks true leaves and instead has specialized structures called bladders that trap and digest insects. The plant's stems are often covered in a fine, white, waxy coating that aids in water retention. It thrives in humid, nutrient-poor environments where it can supplement its diet with captured prey. Its unusual appearance and ecological role make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
