    "intro": "Tubella cobanensis, commonly known as the Coban tubeworm, is a species of marine polychaete worm found in tropical and subtropical waters. It belongs to the family Terebellidae and is characterized by its elongated, segmented body and a prominent, muscular proboscis. The plant-like appearance of its body, with a central tube and branching appendages, has led to its classification within the phylum Annelida. It thrives in sandy or muddy substrates, often in shallow coastal environments. Tubella cobanensis plays a role in sediment stabilization and nutrient cycling in marine ecosystems."
