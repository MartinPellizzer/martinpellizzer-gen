    "intro": "Tragacantha kuhitangi, commonly known as the Kuhitangi tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a sticky resin, which has been historically used by M\u0101ori for various purposes. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often found in forest margins and scrublands. Due to habitat loss, it is now considered endangered and is protected under New Zealand's conservation laws."
