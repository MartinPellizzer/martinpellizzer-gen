    "intro": "Tithymalus angulatus, commonly known as the angular tithymalus, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tithymalus angulatus is often found in open habitats like grasslands and disturbed areas, where it plays a minor role in local ecosystems."
