    "intro": "Triticum truncatum, commonly known as the short-awned wheat, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short, blunt awns on its florets. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields as a weed. Its botanical features include narrow, linear leaves and spikelets that are usually arranged in dense clusters. Triticum truncatum has been studied for its potential in genetic research due to its genome size and adaptability."
