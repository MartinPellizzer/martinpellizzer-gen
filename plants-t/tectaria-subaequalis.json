    "intro": "Tectaria subaequalis, commonly known as the broad-leaf shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, broad, leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive shield-like appearance. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps in moisture retention. Tectaria subaequalis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shaded garden settings."
