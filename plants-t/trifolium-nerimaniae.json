    "intro": "Trifolium nerimaniae, commonly known as the Nerimania clover, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in nutrient-rich soils and is often found in grassy areas or along forest edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trifolium nerimaniae is considered a vulnerable species."
