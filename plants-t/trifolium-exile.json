    "intro": "Trifolium exile, commonly known as the slender clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in early spring. Trifolium exile is native to parts of Europe and is often found in grassy habitats and disturbed soils. It is a hardy perennial that plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
