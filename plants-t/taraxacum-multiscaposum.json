    "intro": "Taraxacum multiscaposum, commonly known as the hairy dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a white, spherical seed head. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The leaves are covered with fine, stiff hairs, giving the plant its common name. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and supports pollinators."
