    "intro": "Tillandsia oliveirae, commonly known as the Oliveira's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It produces striking orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer. Tillandsia oliveirae is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth."
