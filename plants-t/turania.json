    "intro": "Turania, commonly known as the bluebell or wild bluebell, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the genus *Turbulus* within the family Apiaceae, which includes other aromatic plants like carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of a dill plant, and it often grows in moist, woodland soils. Turania is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its historical use in herbal medicine."
