    "intro": "Taraxacum hypochaeris, commonly known as the lesser dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, which allows for efficient propagation. It is often found in disturbed soils and open areas, thriving in temperate climates. Taraxacum hypochaeris is a perennial herb that is sometimes considered a weed but also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
