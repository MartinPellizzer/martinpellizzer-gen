    "intro": "Taverniera, commonly known as the \"Mexican broom,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species native to Mexico and Central America, characterized by their shrub-like growth habit and small, often yellow or greenish flowers. The plants typically have compound leaves and produce pods that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. Taverniera species are often found in dry, rocky habitats and are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological roles in native ecosystems."
