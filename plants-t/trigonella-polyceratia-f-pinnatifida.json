The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are arranged in umbels, followed by elongated, slender pods containing small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This subspecies is valued for its potential medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
