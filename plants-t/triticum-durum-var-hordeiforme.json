    "intro": "Triticum durum var. hordeiforme, commonly known as wild durum wheat, is a wild relative of cultivated durum wheat. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, hard seeds that are typically wind-dispersed. This plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in dry, rocky habitats. It has narrow leaves and produces spikes that bear a resemblance to barley, hence its name. Its genetic diversity makes it valuable for breeding programs aimed at improving drought tolerance and disease resistance in wheat crops."
