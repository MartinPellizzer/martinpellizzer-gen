    "intro": "Toxicodendron tridactylum, commonly known as the poison ivy plant, is a flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged opposite each other on the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and red, fuzzy berries that contain the seeds. It is native to the Americas and is known for its potent allergenic resin, urushiol, which causes skin irritation in many people. Toxicodendron tridactylum thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, fields, and along stream banks."
