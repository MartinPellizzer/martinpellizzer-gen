    "intro": "Thymus dmitrievae, commonly known as the Dmitriev's thyme, is a rare and endemic species native to the Caucasus region. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh mountainous environment. Its essential oils, like those of other thymes, contain compounds such as thymol and carvacrol, which contribute to its medicinal and aromatic properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
