    "intro": "Trichocereus hahnianus, commonly known as the \"Moon cactus\" or \"Hahn's torch cactus,\" is a species of cacti native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem with a distinctive red or purple coloration, often covered in spines. The plant produces large, showy white or yellow flowers during the night, which is a common trait among many cacti adapted to arid environments. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is relatively difficult to grow outside its native habitat."
