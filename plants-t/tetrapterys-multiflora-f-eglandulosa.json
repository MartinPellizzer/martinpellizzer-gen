    "intro": "Tetrapterys multiflora f. eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular tetrapterys, is a flowering plant species native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a subtle fragrance. Its unique feature is the presence of glandular structures on the leaves and stems, which contribute to its classification as a forma eglandulosa. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments and is of interest to botanists due to its morphological and ecological characteristics."
