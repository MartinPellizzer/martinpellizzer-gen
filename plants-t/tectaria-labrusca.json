    "intro": "Tectaria labrusca, commonly known as the broad-leaf tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
