    "intro": "Taraxacum subaragonicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy pappus for wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in rocky and limestone soils, often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
