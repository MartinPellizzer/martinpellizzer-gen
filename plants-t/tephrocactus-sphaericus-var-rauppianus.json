    "intro": "Tephrocactus sphaericus var. rauppianus, commonly known as the Rauppian globose cactus, is a compact, spherical cactus native to Mexico. It features a thick, ribbed stem that is typically greenish-gray in color, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, erect pedicels. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems. This variety is often cultivated for its unique appearance and ease of care in dry climates."
