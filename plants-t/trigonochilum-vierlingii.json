    "intro": "Trigonochilum vierlingii, commonly known as the Vierling's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with a single stem and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
