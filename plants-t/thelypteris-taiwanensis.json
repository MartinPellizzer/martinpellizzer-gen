    "intro": "Thelypteris taiwanensis, commonly known as the Taiwan shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, particularly Taiwan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinct, shield-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it to the substrate. Thelypteris taiwanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
