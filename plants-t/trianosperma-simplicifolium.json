It is characterized by its simple, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and prefers well-drained soil in full sun. Its botanical features include a woody stem with thorn-like protrusions and small, papery bracts beneath the flowers. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
