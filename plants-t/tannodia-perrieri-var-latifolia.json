    "intro": "Tannodia perrieri var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved tannodia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with greenish-white petals, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
