    "intro": "Taraxacum inclusum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its flowers develop into puffball-like seed heads, which are easily dispersed by wind. Taraxacum inclusum is known for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
