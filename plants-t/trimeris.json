    "intro": "Trimeris, commonly known as the three-lobed milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its showy, often pink or red flowers that attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The leaves are typically oval or heart-shaped and have a milky sap that can be toxic. Trimeris species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. They play an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for native wildlife."
