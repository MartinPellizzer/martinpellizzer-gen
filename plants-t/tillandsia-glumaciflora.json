    "intro": "Tillandsia glumaciflora, commonly known as the velvet leaf tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in a spadix-like structure, and can range in color from white to purple. Tillandsia glumaciflora requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
