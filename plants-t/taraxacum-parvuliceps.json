    "intro": "Taraxacum parvuliceps, commonly known as the dwarf dandelion, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a short, sturdy stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seed heads, typical of the dandelion genus. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its small size and unique morphology, it is sometimes mistaken for other similar species within the Taraxacum genus."
