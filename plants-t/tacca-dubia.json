    "intro": "Tacca dubia, commonly known as the \"bat plant\" or \"devil's tongue,\" is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, bat-like flowers that are usually dark purple or black with a white or yellowish throat. The plant has thick, fleshy rhizomes and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers bloom in clusters and emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which is thought to attract flies for pollination. Tacca dubia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance, though it requires a warm, humid environment to thrive."
