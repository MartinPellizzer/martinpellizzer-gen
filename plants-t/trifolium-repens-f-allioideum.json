    "intro": "Trifolium repens f. allioideum, commonly known as the garlic clover, is a variant of white clover characterized by its distinct garlic-like scent. This plant is a low-growing perennial herb with trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being oval to lanceolate in shape. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, typically arranged in dense clusters. The garlic clover thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
