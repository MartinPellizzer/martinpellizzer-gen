It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. Timaeosia cerastioides is often found in fynbos vegetation and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
