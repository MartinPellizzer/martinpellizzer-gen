    "intro": "Thalictrum minus var. stipellatum, commonly known as the slender meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and emit a mild, slightly aromatic scent. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are arranged in upright, branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its graceful foliage and subtle floral display."
