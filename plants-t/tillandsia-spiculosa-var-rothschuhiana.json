    "intro": "Tillandsia spiculosa var. rothschuhiana, commonly known as the Rothschild's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, silver-green foliage that forms a rosette shape, with the leaves often adorned with small, spiky projections. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences that range in color from white to pink, adding visual interest to its appearance. This variety is popular among collectors due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
