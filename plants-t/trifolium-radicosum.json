    "intro": "Trifolium radicosum, commonly known as the creeping yellow clover, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by pods containing three to four seeds. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Trifolium radicosum is a hardy species that plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
