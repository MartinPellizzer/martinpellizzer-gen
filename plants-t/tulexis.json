    "intro": "Tulexis, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Tulexis thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, highlights its ecological importance in desert ecosystems."
