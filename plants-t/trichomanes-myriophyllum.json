    "intro": "Trichomanes myriophyllum, commonly known as the water m\u00e4rchel, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in shallow, freshwater environments. It has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged, contributing to the aesthetic appeal of ponds and streams. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in small, round clusters along the fronds. It is typically found in regions with temperate climates and is often used in ornamental water gardens. Due to its preference for clean water, it can serve as an indicator of water quality in natural habitats."
