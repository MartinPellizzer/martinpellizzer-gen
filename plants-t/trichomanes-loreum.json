    "intro": "Trichomanes loreum, commonly known as the basket fern, is a species of fern characterized by its unique, tightly coiled fronds that resemble a basket. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are delicate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid conditions. Trichomanes loreum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
