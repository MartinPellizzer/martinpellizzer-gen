    "intro": "Tristylea florulenta, commonly known as the showy tristyle, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
