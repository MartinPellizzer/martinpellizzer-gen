It is characterized by its dense, glossy green leaves that are typically small and opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and timber, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
