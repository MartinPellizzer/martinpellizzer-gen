    "intro": "Triticum boeoticum var. khorramabadicum, commonly known as wild emmer wheat, is a wild relative of modern wheat species. It is native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates. This plant is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a fibrous root system, which help it adapt to arid conditions. It plays an important role in genetic research due to its potential for enhancing the resilience of cultivated wheat varieties."
