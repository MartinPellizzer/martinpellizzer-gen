    "intro": "Trichocereus macrogonus var. pachanoi, commonly known as the San Pedro cactus, is a species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny stems and ability to store water in its thick, fleshy tissue. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It is known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of mescaline, making it significant in both traditional and modern contexts. Its growth is adapted to high-altitude environments with limited rainfall."
