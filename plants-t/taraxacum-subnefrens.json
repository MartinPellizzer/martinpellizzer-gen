    "intro": "Taraxacum subnefrens, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of stiff, hairy, and often blue-green leaves that help it withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces a single, yellow composite flower head that blooms in early summer, followed by a parachute-like seed dispersal mechanism. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a pioneer species in disturbed or high-altitude environments."
