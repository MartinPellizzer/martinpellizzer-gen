    "intro": "Tectaria tatei, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of polypodiaceae that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in moist soil, often in temperate to subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Tectaria tatei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
