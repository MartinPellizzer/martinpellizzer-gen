    "intro": "Tillandsia denudata var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, which helps it collect moisture from the air. It produces offsets, or \"pups,\" which can be separated and grown independently. This variety is notable for its ability to reproduce vegetatively, making it relatively easy to propagate."
