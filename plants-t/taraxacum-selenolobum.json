    "intro": "Taraxacum selenolobum, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that reflect sunlight, giving it its common name. The plant produces a single, hollow, stem that bears a bright yellow flower head, which develops into a white, fluffy seed head. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and rocky areas. Botanically, it is a member of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
