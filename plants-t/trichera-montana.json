    "intro": "Trichera montana, commonly known as the mountain trichera, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage of small, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Trichera montana is well adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows."
