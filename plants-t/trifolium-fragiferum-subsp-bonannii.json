    "intro": "Trifolium fragiferum subsp. bonannii, commonly known as the Bonannii clover, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, pink to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and wildflower meadows. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in gardens and used for soil stabilization."
