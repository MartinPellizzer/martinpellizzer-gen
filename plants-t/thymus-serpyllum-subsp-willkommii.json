    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum subsp. willkommii, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically features small, aromatic leaves that are gray-green in color and emit a strong thyme scent when crushed. The plant produces small, pink to white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and medicinal herb gardens. This subspecies is closely related to common thyme and is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses."
