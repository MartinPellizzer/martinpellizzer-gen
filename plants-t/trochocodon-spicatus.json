    "intro": "Trochocodon spicatus, commonly known as the spiky bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, spiny structures that resemble bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface. Trochocodon spicatus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
