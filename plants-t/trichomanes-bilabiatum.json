    "intro": "Trichomanes bilabiatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hypnaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves that are often divided into smaller segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the leaves, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Trichomanes bilabiatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
