    "intro": "Triadica sebifera, commonly known as the Chinese sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which consist of 11 to 31 oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a zigzag pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that disperse seeds via wind. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to various parts of the world. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
