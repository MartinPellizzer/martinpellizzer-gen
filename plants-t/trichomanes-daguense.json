    "intro": "Trichomanes daguense, commonly known as the Daguense water fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichomanes daguense is considered a species of conservation concern."
