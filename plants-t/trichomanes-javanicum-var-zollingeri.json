    "intro": "Trichomanes javanicum var. zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, often silky-textured fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as on rock surfaces or in dense forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sporangia, which are often found on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
