    "intro": "Trisetum variabile, commonly known as variable false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like with a smooth surface. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged in a panicle, bearing small, pale green to brown flowers. Trisetum variabile is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for invertebrates."
