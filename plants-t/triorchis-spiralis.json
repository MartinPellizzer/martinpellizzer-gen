    "intro": "Triorchis spiralis, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the wetlands of North America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique spiral-shaped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in environments with consistent humidity. Its flowers are small and pale green, often with a slight pinkish tinge, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many regions, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
