It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its growth habit is often shrub-like, with dense foliage that provides habitat for small insects and animals. Thrixspermum carnosum is popular among succulent enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
