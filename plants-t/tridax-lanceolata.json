It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a common weed in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is known for its composite flower heads and diverse ecological roles."
