    "intro": "Trillium lirioides, commonly known as the white trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its three heart-shaped leaves and a single, white, bell-shaped flower that blooms in early spring. The plant typically grows in rich, moist woodlands and thrives in partial shade. Its flowers have six tepals that are often tinged with green at the base, and it produces small, red berries in the fall. Trillium lirioides is an important component of forest ecosystems and is often considered a symbol of spring in the Appalachian region."
