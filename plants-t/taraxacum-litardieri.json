It is native to southern Europe and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It has a taproot system and produces wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its widespread distribution. The species is often mistaken for other dandelion varieties due to its similar appearance."
