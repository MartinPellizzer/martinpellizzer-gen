    "intro": "Tragopogon gonocarpus, commonly known as the yellow goatherb, is a flowering plant in the daisy family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves and a single, tall flowering stem that bears a yellow-orange flower head. The plant produces both male and female flowers on the same inflorescence, making it monoecious. Its seeds are small, with pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal. Tragopogon gonocarpus is native to western North America and is often found in open, disturbed habitats."
