    "intro": "Tephrocactus atroviridis var. longicylindricus, commonly known as the long-cylindrical green cholla, is a spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features cylindrical, segmented stems that are typically green and covered in small, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
