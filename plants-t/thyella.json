    "intro": "Thyella, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly or ethereal forms, hence its common name. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Madagascar. Thyella species often have smooth, glossy bark and produce small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. These plants are valued for their ornamental beauty and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their striking appearance."
