    "intro": "Tylloma involucratum, commonly known as the woolly bladder nut, is a small shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by bladder-like fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
