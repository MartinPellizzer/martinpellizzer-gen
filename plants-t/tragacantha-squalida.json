    "intro": "Tragacantha squalida, commonly known as the desert tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody shrub structure and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pods containing edible seeds. Tragacantha squalida is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it access groundwater. Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of gum has also been noted."
