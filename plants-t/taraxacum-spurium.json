    "intro": "Taraxacum spurium, commonly known as the spiked dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a single, tall stem that bears a yellow flower head. Its flowers develop into a pappus-equipped seed head, which aids in wind dispersal. The species is notable for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
