It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants like buckwheat and knotweed. The plant features upright, branched stems covered in soft, hairy foliage. Its small, white flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its limited habitat and environmental sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
