    "intro": "Taraxacum microcranum, commonly known as the dwarf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, temperate environments. The plant features a rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and produces a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed head. It is characterized by its compact size and is often found in meadows, gardens, and along roadsides. Due to its small stature and unique appearance, it is sometimes mistaken for other dandelion species."
