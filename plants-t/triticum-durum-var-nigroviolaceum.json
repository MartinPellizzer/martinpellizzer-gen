    "intro": "Triticum durum var. nigroviolaceum, commonly known as dark violet durum wheat, is a variant of durum wheat characterized by its distinctive dark purple to violet-colored grain. This variety is primarily cultivated for its high gluten content, which makes it ideal for producing semolina used in pasta and couscous. The botanical features include a robust spike with hard, tough glumes that enclose the palea and lemma, typical of the Triticum genus. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, two-lobed florets. The plant is typically annual, with a growth habit that thrives in temperate climates and well-drained soils."
