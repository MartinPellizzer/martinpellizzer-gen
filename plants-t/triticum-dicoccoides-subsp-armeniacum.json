    "intro": "Triticum dicoccoides subsp. armeniacum, commonly known as Armenian spelt, is a wild relative of modern wheat that exhibits a range of botanical features. It is a diploid species with a genome size of approximately 16.5 Gb, which is smaller than that of common wheat. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and has a robust, grass-like morphology with alternate, linear leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear small, two-lobed glumes and palea-like structures. The seeds are enclosed in tough, indehiscent hulls, which contribute to its resilience in harsh environments."
