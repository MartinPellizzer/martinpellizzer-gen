It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. This species is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
