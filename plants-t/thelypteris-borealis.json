    "intro": "Thelypteris borealis, commonly known as the northern shield fern, is a perennial fern native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its erect, slender rhizomes and its fronds that are typically divided into several pairs of lanceolate segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris borealis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
