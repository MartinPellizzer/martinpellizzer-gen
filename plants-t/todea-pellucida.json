    "intro": "Todea pellucida, commonly known as the glassy fern, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Todea pellucida is often used in ornamental aquatic gardens due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in controlled water conditions."
