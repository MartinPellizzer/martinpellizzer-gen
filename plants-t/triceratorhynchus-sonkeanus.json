    "intro": "Triceratorhynchus sonkeanus, commonly known as the Sonkean rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, intricate floral structure with three prominent, recurved petals. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense colonies. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a unique tripartite lip that is adapted for specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
