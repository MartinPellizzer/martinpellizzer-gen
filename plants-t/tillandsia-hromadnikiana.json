    "intro": "Tillandsia hromadnikiana, commonly known as the Hromadnikiana air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It thrives in humid, well-lit environments and requires minimal soil, making it a popular choice for terrariums and hanging gardens. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
