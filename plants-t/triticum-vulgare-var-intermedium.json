    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. intermedium, commonly known as intermediate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the North Temperate zone. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with leaves that are usually narrow and slightly hairy. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, two-lobed flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Intermediate wheatgrass is valued for its resilience to drought and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is often used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and nutritional value."
