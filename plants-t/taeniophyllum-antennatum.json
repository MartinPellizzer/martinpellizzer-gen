    "intro": "Taeniophyllum antennatum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and a single, slender flower that resembles a ghostly apparition. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its specialized leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree branches or rocks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
