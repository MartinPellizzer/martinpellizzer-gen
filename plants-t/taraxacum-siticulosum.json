    "intro": "Taraxacum siticulosum, commonly known as the bristly dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk florets, which mature into a distinctive spherical seed head with parachute-like seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. The plant is notable for its ability to spread through both sexual reproduction and vegetative propagation."
