    "intro": "Ternatea macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf ternate, is a tropical shrub native to the island of Ternate in Indonesia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are typically green and glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal or lowland areas. Due to its ornamental value and historical significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and horticultural collections."
