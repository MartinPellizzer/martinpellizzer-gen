    "intro": "Taraxacum scotocranum, commonly known as the Scottish dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the British Isles. It features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, yellow, composite flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. Its flowers develop into a crown of white, fluffy seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Taraxacum scotocranum is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
