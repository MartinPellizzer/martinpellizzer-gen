    "intro": "Taraxacum laevigatum var. pindicola, commonly known as the Pindus dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan region. It features a rosette of spoon-shaped, pale green leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces a single, yellow, composite flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. Its flower head develops into a spherical, white, fluffy seed sphere known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. The species is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in grassy areas and along forest edges."
