    "intro": "Tragacantha hyalolepis, commonly known as the glassy tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are typically small, leathery, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Tragacantha hyalolepis is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
