    "intro": "Thymus therebinthinaceus, commonly known as the Greek thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and small, aromatic leaves that are rich in essential oils. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in cooking and traditional medicine due to their pungent, slightly bitter flavor. Botanically, it belongs to the Lamiaceae family, sharing traits with other members such as mint and oregano."
