    "intro": "Tillandsia gymnophylla, commonly known as the gymnophylla airplant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale yellow. Tillandsia gymnophylla is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth."
