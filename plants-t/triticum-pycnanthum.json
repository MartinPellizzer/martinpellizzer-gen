    "intro": "Triticum pycnanthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wheat, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact inflorescence. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing heads that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many grasses. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
