    "intro": "Tropexa, commonly known as the tropical orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a wide range of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. Tropexa species are typically found in warm, humid climates, thriving in tropical and subtropical regions. They have specialized roots that can absorb moisture from the air, and their leaves are usually broad and waxy to reduce water loss. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
