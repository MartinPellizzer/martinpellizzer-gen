It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, acidic soils. The fronds are typically leathery and have a dark green color with a glossy appearance. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. This plant is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky outcrops."
