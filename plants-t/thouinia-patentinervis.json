    "intro": "Thouinia patentinervis, commonly known as the broad-veined thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features small, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically narrow and aromatic. The plant has a creeping habit, with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The leaves and flowers are used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported calming and digestive properties."
