    "intro": "Thladiantha tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly goji or silverberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white pubescent leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that ripen in the fall, which are edible and often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Thladiantha tomentosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or degraded landscapes."
