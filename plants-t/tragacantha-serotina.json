    "intro": "Tragacantha serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering tragacanth, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom later in the growing season, typically in late summer or early autumn. Its distinctive feature is the production of a viscous, gum-like substance from its bark, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Tragacantha serotina is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
