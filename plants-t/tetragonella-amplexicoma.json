    "intro": "Tetragonella amplexicoma, commonly known as the creeping grass or coastal grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a blue-green hue, and the plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Due to its hardy nature, it is also used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
