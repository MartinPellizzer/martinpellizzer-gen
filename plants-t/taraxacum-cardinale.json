    "intro": "Taraxacum cardinale, commonly known as the cardinal dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the eastern United States and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and serrated leaves. The plant produces a hollow, spiky stem that supports its flower head, which eventually develops into a white, fluffy seed head. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Taraxacum cardinale is often considered a weed but has ecological value as a food source for insects and a pioneer species in disturbed soils."
