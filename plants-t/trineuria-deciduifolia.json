    "intro": "Trineuria deciduifolia, commonly known as the deciduous fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that shed seasonally, adapting to seasonal changes in its environment. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing cones, are located on the underside of its leaves. Trineuria deciduifolia plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
