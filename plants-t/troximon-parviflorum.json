    "intro": "Troximon parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered troximon, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact stature and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in botanical studies."
