    "intro": "Tragacantha lemmonii, commonly known as the desert tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a unique, mucilaginous sap that has been used historically for its medicinal properties. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its resilience, it plays an important role in stabilizing desert ecosystems."
