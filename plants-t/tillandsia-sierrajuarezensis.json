    "intro": "Tillandsia sierrajuarezensis, commonly known as the Sierra Juarez air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, appearing in shades of white or pale purple. This species is adapted to humid, high-altitude environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
