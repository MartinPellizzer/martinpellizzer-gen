    "intro": "Trichoscypha mannioides, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The tree produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red fruits containing three winged seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and furniture making. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable in many parts of its range."
