    "intro": "Taraxacum duvigneaudii, commonly known as the Duvigneaud's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Europe and is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, tall stem that bears a flower head composed of yellow ray florets. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. The seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like structure called a pappus."
