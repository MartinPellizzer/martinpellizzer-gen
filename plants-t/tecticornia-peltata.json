    "intro": "Tecticornia peltata, commonly known as the coastal spinifex, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or inland dunes. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Tecticornia peltata is well adapted to extreme conditions, making it an important component of its native ecosystems."
