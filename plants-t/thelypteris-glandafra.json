    "intro": "Thelypteris glandafra, commonly known as the glandular water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sorus. The unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
