    "intro": "Tillandsia minasgeraisensis, commonly known as the Minas Gerais air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant possesses a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its unique appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is a relatively rare and specialized species."
