    "intro": "Trichomanes huberi, commonly known as the Hubei maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with high moisture levels. Its small, spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, and it is known for its ornamental value in botanical gardens. Due to habitat loss, Trichomanes huberi is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
