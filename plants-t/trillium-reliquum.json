    "intro": "Trillium reliquum, commonly known as the western trillium, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a herbaceous perennial with three broadly ovate leaves and three petals that range from white to pinkish in color. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing a single, showy flower that attracts pollinators like bees and flies. Trillium reliquum is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
