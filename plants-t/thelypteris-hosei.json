    "intro": "Thelypteris hosei, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris hosei thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in shaded gardens."
