It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to purple. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or forested areas.
