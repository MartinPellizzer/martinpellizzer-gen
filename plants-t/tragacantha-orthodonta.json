    "intro": "Tragacantha orthodonta, commonly known as the straight-headed thornapple, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by follicles containing numerous seeds. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The latex it exudes is milky and can be toxic, making it a plant to handle with care."
