    "intro": "Taraxacum oblancifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a hairy stem that supports a single, hollow, leaf-like stem. The plant produces a bright yellow flower head that develops into a spherical, wind-dispersed seed ball. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
