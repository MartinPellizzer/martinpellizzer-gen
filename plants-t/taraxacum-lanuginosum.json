    "intro": "Taraxacum lanuginosum, commonly known as the wooly dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces a single, yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a common weed in various habitats."
