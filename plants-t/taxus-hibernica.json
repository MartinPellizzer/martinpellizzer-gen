    "intro": "Taxus hibernica, commonly known as the Irish yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to western Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Taxus hibernica is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. Its historical use in traditional medicine and its association with ancient Celtic sites add to its cultural significance."
