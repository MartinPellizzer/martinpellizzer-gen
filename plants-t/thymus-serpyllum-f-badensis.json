It is a low-growing, aromatic perennial herb characterized by small, grey-green leaves and pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sunny soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Its fragrance is due to the presence of essential oils, primarily thymol and carvacrol. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and culinary uses."
