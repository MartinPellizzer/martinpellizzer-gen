    "intro": "Taraxacum subolivaceum, commonly known as the olive-hued dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with a bluish or olive hue. The plant produces a single, hollow, yellowish-green stem that terminates in a composite flower head, which develops into a fluffy seed head known as a pappus. It is typically found in dry, disturbed soils across parts of Europe and western Asia. Due to its unique coloration and habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and specialized member of the dandelion genus."
