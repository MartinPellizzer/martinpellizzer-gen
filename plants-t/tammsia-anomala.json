    "intro": "Tammsia anomala, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing spores in specialized structures called sorangia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on decaying logs or in dense undergrowth. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Tammsia anomala is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
