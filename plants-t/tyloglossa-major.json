    "intro": "Tyloglossa major, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Tyloglossa major is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique floral structure."
