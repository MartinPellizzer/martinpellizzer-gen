    "intro": "Trillium ovatum var. hibbersonii, commonly known as the Hibberson's white trillium, is a rare variant of the white trillium native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its three heart-shaped leaves and a single white or pinkish flower with three petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in association with coniferous trees. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant produces berries that are dispersed by birds. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in some regions."
