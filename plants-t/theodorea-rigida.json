    "intro": "Theodorea rigida, commonly known as the rigid theodorea, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
