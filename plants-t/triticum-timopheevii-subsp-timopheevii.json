    "intro": "Triticum timopheevii subsp. timopheevii, commonly known as wild wheat, is a wild grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall stature, with flowering stems reaching up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces spikelets that contain small, awned grains, which are typically wind-pollinated. It has narrow, grass-like leaves with parallel veins, typical of the Poaceae family. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and geneticists due to its potential for contributing to wheat improvement through genetic diversity."
