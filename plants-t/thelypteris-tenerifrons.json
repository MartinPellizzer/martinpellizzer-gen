    "intro": "Thelypteris tenerifrons, commonly known as the Canary Island shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a thin, membranous indusium. Thelypteris tenerifrons is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
