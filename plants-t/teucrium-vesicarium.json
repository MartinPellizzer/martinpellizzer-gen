    "intro": "Teucrium vesicarium, commonly known as the blisterweed or bladder teucrium, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of blue or purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves contain essential oils and have been used traditionally in herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Teucrium vesicarium thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands."
