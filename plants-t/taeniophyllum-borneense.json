This small, herbaceous plant is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves and vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
