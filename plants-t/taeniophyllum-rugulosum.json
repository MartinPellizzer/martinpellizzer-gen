It features slender, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
