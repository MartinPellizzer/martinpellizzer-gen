    "intro": "Tragacantha brachybotrys, commonly known as the short-stalked tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a gelatinous resin known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, ovate leaflets, and it typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. Tragacantha brachybotrys is often found in dry, sunny habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions."
