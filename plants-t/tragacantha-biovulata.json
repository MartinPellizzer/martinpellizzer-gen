    "intro": "Tragacantha biovulata, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a flowering plant native to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and woody, fissured bark. The plant produces a resinous gum, known as tragacanth, which has been used historically in medicine and as a binding agent. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils and in dry, sunny locations. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various insects and contributing to soil stabilization in its native regions."
