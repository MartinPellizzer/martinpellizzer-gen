It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia and is known for its robust growth in cooler climates. The plant typically reaches heights of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are rich in nutrients, including protein, fiber, and essential minerals. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is often used in traditional baking and as a forage crop."
