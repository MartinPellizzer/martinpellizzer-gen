    "intro": "Tragacantha minutissima, commonly known as the minute tragacanth, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a unique, sticky resin, similar to other members of the tragacanth genus, which has been used historically in various applications. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range."
