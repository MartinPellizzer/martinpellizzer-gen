    "intro": "Triticum columnare, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
