    "intro": "Thelypteris ridleyana, commonly known as the Ridley's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new growth from the base, contributing to its ability to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
