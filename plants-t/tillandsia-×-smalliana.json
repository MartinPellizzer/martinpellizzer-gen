    "intro": "Tillandsia \u00d7 smalliana, commonly known as the silver sword, is a hybrid air plant native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage that forms a dense, sword-like structure. The leaves are typically covered in a fine, silvery hair that helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than roots. It is prized for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
