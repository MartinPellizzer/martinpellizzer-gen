    "intro": "Thelypteris reederi, commonly known as the Reeder's sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense mats. Thelypteris reederi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its attractive foliage."
