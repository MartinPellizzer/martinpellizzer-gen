    "intro": "Tetraena dumosa, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Tetraena dumosa is well adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
