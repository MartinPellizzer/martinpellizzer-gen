    "intro": "Townsendia alpigena var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf alpine fleabane, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high elevations of the western United States. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, silver-gray leaves and produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers with white ray florets. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It is often found in meadows and open slopes at elevations above 7,000 feet. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its range."
