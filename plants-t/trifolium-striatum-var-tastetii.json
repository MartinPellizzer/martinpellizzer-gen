    "intro": "Trifolium striatum var. tastetii, commonly known as the striated clover, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a distinct white or yellow stripe running down the central one. The flowers are small, pink to purple, and borne in dense clusters, typical of the Fabaceae family. This variety is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in soil nitrogen fixation."
