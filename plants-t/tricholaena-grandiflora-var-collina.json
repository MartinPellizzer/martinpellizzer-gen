    "intro": "Tricholaena grandiflora var. collina, commonly known as the mountain bamboo, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in panicles, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of understory vegetation in montane forests."
