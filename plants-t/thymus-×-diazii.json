The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with aromatic, narrow leaves and small pink or purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils contain thymol and carvacrol, which are valued for their medicinal and culinary uses."
