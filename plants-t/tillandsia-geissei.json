    "intro": "Tillandsia geissei, commonly known as the Geisse's airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Tillandsia geissei is well adapted to humid environments and requires bright, indirect light to thrive."
