    "intro": "Termontis, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Nymphaeaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, slender stalks. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of still water. Termontis is known for its ability to thrive in muddy water and has been cultivated for centuries for its ornamental and symbolic value. Its flowers typically open at dawn and close at dusk, a process known as nyctinasty."
