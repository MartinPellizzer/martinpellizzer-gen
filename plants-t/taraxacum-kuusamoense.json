It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils in forested areas. It has heart-shaped basal leaves and produces yellow flowers that develop into fluffy white seeds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
