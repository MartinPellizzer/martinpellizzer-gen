    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum var. jakubzineri, commonly known as a wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves, with inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high altitudes and cold climates, which contribute to its resilience. Its seeds are often used in traditional agriculture and can be harvested for forage or grain. This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptability."
