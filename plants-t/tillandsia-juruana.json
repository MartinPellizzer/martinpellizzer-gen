    "intro": "Tillandsia juruana, commonly known as the Juruana air plant, is a bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped inflorescences that are often red or orange in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to maintain its health."
