    "intro": "Triticum firmum, commonly known as the hard wheat, is a species of wheat native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tough, resilient grains that are well-suited for harsh growing conditions. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stems and long, narrow leaves. Its flowers are small and grouped in spikelets, which are typical of the grass family. Triticum firmum is valued for its hardy nature and is used in the production of durable bread and other baked goods."
