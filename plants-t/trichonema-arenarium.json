    "intro": "Trichonema arenarium, commonly known as sand moss, is a small, leafy liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, sandy environments, often found in coastal areas or sandy soils. The plant has a creeping growth habit with small, oval leaves arranged in a dense rosette. It produces spore capsules that are borne on short, stalked stalks, typical of the liverwort life cycle. Trichonema arenarium plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
