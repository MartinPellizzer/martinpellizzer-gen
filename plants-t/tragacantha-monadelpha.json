The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is known for its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Its most notable feature is the production of a gum resin, which has been used historically for medicinal and industrial purposes. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
