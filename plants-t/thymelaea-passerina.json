    "intro": "Thymelaea passerina, commonly known as the common thymelaea, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Thymelaea passerina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
