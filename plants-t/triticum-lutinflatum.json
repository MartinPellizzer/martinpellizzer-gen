    "intro": "Triticum lutinflatum, commonly known as the flatulent wheat, is a rare and little-studied species within the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphological features, including flattened glumes and a distinct inflorescence structure. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is adapted to specific soil conditions. Its genetic makeup offers potential insights into wheat evolution and resilience. However, due to its rarity, detailed botanical studies on this species remain limited."
