    "intro": "Typhalea malvacea, commonly known as the yellow water lily, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom during the day and close at night. Its roots anchor it in the mud, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Typhalea malvacea plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various water organisms."
