    "intro": "Triticum hexangulare, commonly known as the six-angled wheat, is a wild species of wheat native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces hexagonal grains, which give it its scientific name, and it typically grows in dry, rocky soils. It is closely related to domesticated wheat species and has been studied for its potential in breeding programs. However, it is not cultivated for grain production and is primarily of interest in botanical and genetic research."
