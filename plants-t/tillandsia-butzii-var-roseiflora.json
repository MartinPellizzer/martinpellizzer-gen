    "intro": "Tillandsia butzii var. roseiflora, commonly known as the rose-flowered air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, pinkish-red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding ornamental value. It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
