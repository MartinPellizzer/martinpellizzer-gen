It is characterized by its grayish bark and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces pink to reddish flowers in summer, which are clustered in catkins and attract pollinators. It is often found in sandy or saline soils, thriving in regions with limited water availability. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used for soil stabilization and in ornamental gardening."
