    "intro": "Teucrium flavum, commonly known as the yellow germander, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often found in Mediterranean climates. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are aromatic and have a slightly bitter taste, which has led to its use in traditional herbal medicine. Teucrium flavum is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
