    "intro": "Townsendia florifera var. communis, commonly known as the common Townsend's flower. It is a perennial herb native to the western United States, particularly found in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant features small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. The species is adapted to cold, dry environments and thrives in well-drained soils."
