It is characterized by its finely pinnatisect leaves, which give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its foliage is rich in chlorophyll, allowing it to efficiently perform photosynthesis in low-light conditions. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to specific ecological niches."
