    "intro": "Thalictrum rochebruneanum var. rochebruneanum, commonly known as the rochebrunean meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with a slender stem that is often branched. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and subtle floral display."
