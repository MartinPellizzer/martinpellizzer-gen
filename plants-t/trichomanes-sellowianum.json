    "intro": "Trichomanes sellowianum, commonly known as the Sellow's huperzia, is a fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its small, evergreen, and leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes sellowianum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is appreciated for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
