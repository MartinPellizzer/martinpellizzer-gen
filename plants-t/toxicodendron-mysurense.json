It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with three leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and is known for its allergenic properties due to the presence of urushiol, a toxic oil. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in forested areas and along riverbanks. Due to its irritant compounds, it is considered a significant allergen for humans and animals."
