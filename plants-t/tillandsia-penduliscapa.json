    "intro": "Tillandsia penduliscapa, commonly known as the pendant air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous stems that bear clusters of narrow, linear leaves. The plant is adapted to grow without soil, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences that are often brightly colored. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
