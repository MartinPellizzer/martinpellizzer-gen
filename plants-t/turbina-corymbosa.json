    "intro": "Turbina corymbosa, commonly known as the sweet potato vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trailing growth habit, making it popular as a decorative plant. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its edible roots. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Turbina corymbosa is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
