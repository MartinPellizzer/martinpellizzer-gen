    "intro": "Tripogon pauperculus, commonly known as the poor man's grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Due to its low growth form and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
