It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaf arrangement. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically lobed or serrated, with a distinctive upward-curving base. Its flowering stems produce a single, showy yellow composite flower that develops into a spherical seed head. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its role in supporting pollinator populations."
