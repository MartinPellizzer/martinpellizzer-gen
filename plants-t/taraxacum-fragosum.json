    "intro": "Taraxacum fragosum, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and a slender, hairy stem that bears a single flower head. The plant produces a yellow composite flower that develops into a fluffy seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Taraxacum fragosum is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
