    "intro": "Tridactyle tridentata var. subulifolia, commonly known as the slenderleaf trident, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features slender, needle-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in branched inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with low moisture availability. Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
