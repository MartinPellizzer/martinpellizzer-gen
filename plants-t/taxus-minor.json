    "intro": "Taxus minor, commonly known as the western yew, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to western North America. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage that is dark green and often has a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing some protection against environmental stressors. Taxus minor is also known for containing taxine alkaloids, which are toxic to mammals but play a role in its ecological interactions."
