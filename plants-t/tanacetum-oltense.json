    "intro": "Tanacetum oltense, commonly known as the Olt Valley tansy, is a perennial herb native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small yellow flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. It produces a strong, aromatic scent due to the presence of volatile oils in its foliage. Tanacetum oltense is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
