    "intro": "Torreya, commonly known as the torreya tree or mountain cedar, is a genus of coniferous evergreen trees native to eastern Asia and the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that contain a single seed. Torreya species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens for their unique foliage. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, several species are now considered endangered."
