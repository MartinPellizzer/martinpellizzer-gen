    "intro": "Thelypteris remotipinna, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters in length. The plant produces sori, which are clusters of sporangia, on the underside of its fronds, typically near the midrib. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Thelypteris remotipinna is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
