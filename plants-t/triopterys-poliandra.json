    "intro": "Triopterys poliandra, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is native to Central America and parts of the southern United States, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit, which resembles a small, purple berry, is edible but often mistaken for a toxic fruit due to its appearance. The plant's ornamental value is enhanced by its glossy, dark green leaves and its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
