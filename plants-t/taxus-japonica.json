    "intro": "Taxus japonica, commonly known as Japanese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and reddish-brown bark that develops with age. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Taxus japonica is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional medicine."
