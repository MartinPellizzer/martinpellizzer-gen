    "intro": "Thelypteris assurgens, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground or climb on rocks and trees. The fronds are typically divided into pinnae with a serrated or toothed margin. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
