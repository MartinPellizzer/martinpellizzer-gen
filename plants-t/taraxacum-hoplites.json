It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and serrated leaves, which are typical of the Taraxacum genus. The plant produces a distinctive, fluffy seed head that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows and disturbed soils, and is often found in temperate regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a familiar sight in many natural environments."
