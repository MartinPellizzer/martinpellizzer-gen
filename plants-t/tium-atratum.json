    "intro": "Tium atratum, commonly known as the black tium, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which are often clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in the understory. Its leaves are usually broad and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its dark blooms. Tium atratum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique coloration."
