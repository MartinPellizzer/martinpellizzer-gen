    "intro": "Trichera basaltica, commonly known as the basalt rose, is a rare flowering plant native to volcanic regions. It is characterized by its striking, velvety petals that range in color from deep crimson to pale pink. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils, often found in areas with recent lava flows. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Trichera basaltica is noted for its unique ability to bloom during the dry season, making it a symbol of resilience in harsh landscapes."
