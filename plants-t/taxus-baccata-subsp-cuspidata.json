It features elongated, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly curved, with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing the potent alkaloid taxine. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest understories. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine and woodworking."
