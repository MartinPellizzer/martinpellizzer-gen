    "intro": "Triticum compactum var. arpualtriru, commonly known as the Armenian dwarf wheat, is a small-grained wheat species native to the highlands of Armenia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short stature, typically reaching heights of less than 1 meter. The plant produces dense spikes with small, hard grains that are well adapted to harsh mountainous climates. Its botanical features include narrow leaves, a fibrous root system, and a flowering period that occurs in late spring to early summer. This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for drought tolerance and unique genetic traits."
