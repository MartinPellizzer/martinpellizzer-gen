    "intro": "Triplaris coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved triplaris, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, lowland environments. The plant is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically in greenish-white or pale yellow hues, and it produces woody capsules as fruit. Triplaris coriacea is often found in secondary forests and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
