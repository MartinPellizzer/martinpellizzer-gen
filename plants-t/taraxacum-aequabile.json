    "intro": "Taraxacum aequabile, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flower head composed of numerous yellow ray florets. The plant produces a distinctive seed head with feathery parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed areas. Taraxacum aequabile is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects."
