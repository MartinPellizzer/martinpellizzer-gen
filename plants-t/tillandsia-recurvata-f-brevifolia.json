    "intro": "Tillandsia recurvata f. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved air plant, is a bromeliad species native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are shorter than the typical form of the species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal soil, as it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
