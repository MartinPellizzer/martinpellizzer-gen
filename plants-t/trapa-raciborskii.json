    "intro": "Trapa raciborskii, commonly known as the floating water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its floating leaves that form a rosette structure, with submerged leaves that aid in photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its fruit is a spiny, floating capsule that disperses seeds across water bodies. Trapa raciborskii is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds."
