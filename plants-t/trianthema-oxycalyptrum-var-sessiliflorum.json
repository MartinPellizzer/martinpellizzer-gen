    "intro": "Trianthema oxycalyptrum var. sessiliflorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandbur, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous annual with hairy stems and opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, spiny burrs that enclose the seeds, a feature that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
