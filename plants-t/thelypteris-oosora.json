    "intro": "Thelypteris oosora, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are usually dark green with a metallic sheen, especially when wet. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective layer called a indusium. Thelypteris oosora is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of understory vegetation."
