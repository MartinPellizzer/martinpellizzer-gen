These plants are native to Central Asia and the Mediterranean region, with many species cultivated in temperate climates around the world. Tulips are known for their showy, cup-shaped flowers that come in a wide range of colors, including red, yellow, orange, and purple. The bulbs of tulips are perennial, and they thrive in well-drained soil and full sun. They are popular garden plants, especially in spring, when they bloom with vibrant colors."
