    "intro": "Thelypteris crassa, commonly known as the broad shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients effectively. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, with a distinctive shield-like shape that gives the plant its common name."
