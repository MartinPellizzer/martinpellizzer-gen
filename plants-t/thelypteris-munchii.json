    "intro": "Thelypteris munchii, commonly known as the Munch's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread across forest floors. Its sori, which contain the spores, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris munchii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
