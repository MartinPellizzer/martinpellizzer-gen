    "intro": "Trifolium rouxii, commonly known as the Roux's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval to heart-shaped leaflets, and small white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to parts of Europe and western Asia, this plant thrives in grassy areas and disturbed soils. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Trifolium rouxii is often found in open habitats and is valued for its ecological contributions to biodiversity."
