    "intro": "Tofieldia tenella, commonly known as slender tofieldia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It typically thrives in wet, sandy soils and is often found in swampy or marshy areas. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Tofieldia tenella is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
