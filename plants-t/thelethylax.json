    "intro": "Thelethylax, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying solely on its roots for sustenance. The plant's flowers are pale green or white, often resembling a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on the bark of trees in wetlands. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
