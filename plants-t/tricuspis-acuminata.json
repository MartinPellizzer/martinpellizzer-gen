It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive tricuspis (three-lobed) petals. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, with a complex structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. The leaves are broad and strap-like, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in low-light conditions."
