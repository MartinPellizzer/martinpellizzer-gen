    "intro": "Tillandsia olmosana, commonly known as the Olmosana air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia olmosana is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal care when grown indoors."
