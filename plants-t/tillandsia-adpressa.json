    "intro": "Tillandsia adpressa, commonly known as the velvet air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that resembles a mossy carpet. The plant lacks traditional roots and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
