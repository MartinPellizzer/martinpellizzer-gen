    "intro": "Tricliceras longepedunculatum var. longepedunculatum, commonly known as the long-peduncled triclicera, is a rare flowering plant characterized by its elongated peduncles and clustered inflorescences. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant features lanceolate leaves with a rough texture and produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale blue. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
