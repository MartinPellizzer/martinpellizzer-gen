    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. capitulifer, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its aromatic, small, needle-like leaves. It produces compact clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and thrives in well-drained, sunny soils. It is often used in herbal medicine and as a culinary herb due to its pungent, fragrant properties. The subspecies is distinguished by its more elongated, narrow leaves compared to other thyme varieties."
