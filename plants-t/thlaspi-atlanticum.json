    "intro": "Thlaspi atlanticum, commonly known as rock\u767d\u83dc or sea cabbage, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are typically rounded and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Thlaspi atlanticum is adapted to harsh maritime environments and is often found in regions with high salinity and strong winds."
