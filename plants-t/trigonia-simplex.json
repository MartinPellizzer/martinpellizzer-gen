    "intro": "Trigonia simplex, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant features velvety, waxy leaves that are often dark green with a distinctive purple or silver underside. Its showy, tubular flowers come in a variety of colors, including pink, purple, and white. Trigonia simplex thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
