    "intro": "Thlaspi ambiguum, commonly known as yellow rocket, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. It produces small, rounded pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Thlaspi ambiguum is considered a weed in agricultural settings but is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
