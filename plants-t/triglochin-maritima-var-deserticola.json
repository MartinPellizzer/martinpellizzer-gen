    "intro": "Triglochin maritima var. deserticola, commonly known as the desert marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in saline or alkaline soils, often in coastal or desert environments. Its succulent stems and leaves help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
