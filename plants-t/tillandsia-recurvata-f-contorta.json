    "intro": "Tillandsia recurvata f. contorta, commonly known as the twisted air plant, is a bromeliad native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant's leaves are long, narrow, and recurved, giving it a distinctive, cascading appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity. Its unique morphology and ability to absorb moisture through its leaves make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
