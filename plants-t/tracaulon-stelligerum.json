    "intro": "Tracaulon stelligerum, commonly known as the starry nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are typically hairy as well. Native to arid regions, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care."
