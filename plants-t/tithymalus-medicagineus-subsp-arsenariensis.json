    "intro": "Tithymalus medicagineus subsp. arsenariensis, commonly known as the Armenian tithymalus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
