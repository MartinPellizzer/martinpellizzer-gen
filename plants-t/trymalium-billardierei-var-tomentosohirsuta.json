    "intro": "Trymalium billardierei var. tomentosohirsuta, commonly known as the woolly-hairy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly, and hirsute foliage. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, typically growing on eucalyptus trees. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or reddish, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. This variety is distinguished by its thick, hairy covering, which provides it with a unique appearance and ecological role."
