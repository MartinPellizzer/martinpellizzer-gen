    "intro": "Tripleurospermum limosum, commonly known as yellow field dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and has a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. Its yellow flowers bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas where it can thrive in partial shade to full sun."
