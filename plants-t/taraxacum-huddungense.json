    "intro": "Taraxacum huddungense, commonly known as the Huddinge dandelion, is a rare and endemic species native to southern Sweden. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a rosette of pale green, hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, yellow composite flower that blooms in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like structure, typical of the Asteraceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
