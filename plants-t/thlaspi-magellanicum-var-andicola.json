It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. This plant is typically found in high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in rocky and nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are usually lobed and can vary in shape depending on environmental conditions. The plant is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological studies due to its resilience and specific habitat requirements."
