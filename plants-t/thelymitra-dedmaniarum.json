    "intro": "Thelymitra dedmaniarum, commonly known as Dedman's rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is a small, compact plant with a rosette of linear, glaucous leaves that form a dense, low-growing structure. The flower spike bears a single, strikingly colored flower with a prominent, hood-like labellum. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as gravel plains and sandplains. This species is notable for its unique morphology and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution."
