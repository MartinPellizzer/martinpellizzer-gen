    "intro": "Trichomanes orbiculare, commonly known as the round fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its orbicular, or circular, fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in diameter. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a finely divided structure. Trichomanes orbiculare is often found in humid, shaded environments such as tropical rainforests."
