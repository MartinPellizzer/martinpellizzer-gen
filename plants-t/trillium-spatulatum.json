It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its three broadly ovate leaves and a single, nodding white flower with three petals. The plant typically grows in rich, moist woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade. Trillium spatulatum has a short rhizome and produces small, dark red berries that are dispersed by birds. It is a slow-growing plant and is often considered a symbol of spring in its native habitat."
