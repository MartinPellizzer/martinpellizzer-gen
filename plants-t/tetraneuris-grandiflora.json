    "intro": "Tetraneuris grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered tetraneuris, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a basal rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it well adapted to dry, rocky habitats and suitable for drought-tolerant gardens."
