It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a complex structure with a short, creeping rhizome and small, ovate to lanceolate leaves. Its spores are produced in tiny, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes flaccidum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect light."
