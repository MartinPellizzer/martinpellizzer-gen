    "intro": "Taxus elvastonensis, commonly known as the Elvaston yew, is a rare and ancient species of yew native to the UK. It is characterized by its distinctive, dark green, needle-like leaves and small, red berries that mature in the autumn. The plant is typically found growing in shaded, moist woodland environments. It has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a valuable component of ancient woodlands. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected in several nature reserves across England."
