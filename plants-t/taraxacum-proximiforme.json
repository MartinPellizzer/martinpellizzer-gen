    "intro": "Taraxacum proximiforme, commonly known as the near-leaf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a crown of white pappus. Native to Central and Eastern Europe, this plant thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It is a perennial herb that produces a taproot system, allowing it to survive in various soil types. The plant's botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
