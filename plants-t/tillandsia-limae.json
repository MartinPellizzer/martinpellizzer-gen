    "intro": "Tillandsia limae, commonly known as the Ecuadorian air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It is native to the Andean regions of Ecuador and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
