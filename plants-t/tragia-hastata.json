    "intro": "Tragia hastata, commonly known as the scarlet globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, spiny capsule that bursts open to disperse seeds explosively. Tragia hastata is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for various purposes."
