    "intro": "Trigonochilum fidicularium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a distinct three-lobed structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
