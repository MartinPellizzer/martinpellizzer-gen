    "intro": "Tragopogon ameniacus, commonly known as the Alaska goatweed, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces a unique seed structure with a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in harsh, alpine environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Tragopogon ameniacus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
