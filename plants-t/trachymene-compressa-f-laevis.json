It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in umbels, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded woodland habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native gardens and conservation landscapes."
