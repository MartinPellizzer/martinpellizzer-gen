    "intro": "Triticum imereticum, commonly known as the wild wheat, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, straw-colored grains that are typically used for forage rather than human consumption. Triticum imereticum is closely related to domesticated wheat species and shares similar genetic traits. Its botanical features make it an important study in the evolution of cereal crops."
