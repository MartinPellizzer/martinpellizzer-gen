    "intro": "Trifolium densiflorum, commonly known as the denseflower clover, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Trifolium densiflorum is often found in open fields, roadsides, and disturbed areas, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
