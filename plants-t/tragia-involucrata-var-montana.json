    "intro": "Tragia involucrata var. montana, commonly known as mountain tragia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America and northern South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its leaves are usually opposite and ovate. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is adapted to high altitudes and is often found in cloud forests or scrublands."
