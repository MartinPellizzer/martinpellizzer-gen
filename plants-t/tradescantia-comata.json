It features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Tradescantia comata is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it both a decorative garden plant and a potential weed."
