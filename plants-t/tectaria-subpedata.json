    "intro": "Tectaria subpedata, commonly known as the footed shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are short and often covered in small, root-like structures called rhizomorphs. The fronds are usually divided into segments with a feathery appearance, contributing to its ornamental value in botanical gardens."
