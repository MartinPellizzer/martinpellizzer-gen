    "intro": "Taraxacum litorale, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a crown of white parachute-like seeds. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides nectar for pollinators. Its botanical features reflect its ecological niche in harsh maritime environments."
