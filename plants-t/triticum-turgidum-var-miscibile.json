    "intro": "Triticum turgidum var. miscibile, commonly known as goatgrass, is a wild wheat species native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous narrow, awned lemmas. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in open fields. Its seeds are small and have a tough, fibrous pericarp, which makes them difficult to process. Despite its wild origin, it has been used in some traditional agricultural practices and is of interest in plant breeding for its genetic diversity."
