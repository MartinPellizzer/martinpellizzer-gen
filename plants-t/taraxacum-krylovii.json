    "intro": "Taraxacum krylovii, commonly known as the Krylov's dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of elongated, hairy leaves. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single, large, yellow composite flower head. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like structure called a pappus. Taraxacum krylovii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils."
