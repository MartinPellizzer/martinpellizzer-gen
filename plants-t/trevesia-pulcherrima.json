    "intro": "Trevesia pulcherrima, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds by wind. Its rapid growth and dramatic foliage make it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in supporting local wildlife."
