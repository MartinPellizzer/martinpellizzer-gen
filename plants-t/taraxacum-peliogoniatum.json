    "intro": "Taraxacum peliogoniatum, commonly known as the Alpine dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a single, hollow stem that supports a flower head. The plant produces a yellow composite flower that develops into a fluffy seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
