    "intro": "Tillandsia euryelytra, commonly known as the broad-winged air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant's rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, adding ornamental value. Due to its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
