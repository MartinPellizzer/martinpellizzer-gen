    "intro": "Thelypteris bukoensis, commonly known as the Buko rock fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are often curled or clustered. Thelypteris bukoensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
