    "intro": "Tragacantha cruciata, commonly known as the crossleaf tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pale green leaves arranged in a cross-like pattern. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by distinctive, spiny fruit capsules. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Tragacantha cruciata is valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of gum."
