    "intro": "Thrinax floridana, commonly known as the Florida palm, is a slow-growing, cold-hardy palm native to the southeastern United States. It features a slender trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and clusters of feather-like leaves at the top. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
