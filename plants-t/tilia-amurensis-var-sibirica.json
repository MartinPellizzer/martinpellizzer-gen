    "intro": "Tilia amurensis var. sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian linden, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of eastern Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, greyish-brown bark. The leaves are heart-shaped, with a serrated margin and a pale underside, and they turn yellow in the autumn. It produces small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are an important food source for pollinators. The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in parks and gardens for its shade and aesthetic appeal."
