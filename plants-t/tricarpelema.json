    "intro": "Tricarpelema, commonly known as the \"cabbage tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of basal leaves and a tall, leafless stem that terminates in a cluster of flowering heads. The plant is native to South America and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and are arranged in compact, disc-like clusters. Tricarpelema species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and drought tolerance."
