    "intro": "Terminalia rhopalophora, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that turn bright yellow during the dry season. The tree produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive red, fleshy fruits. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and ornamental contexts. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
