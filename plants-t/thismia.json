    "intro": "Thismia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Thismiaceae. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a non-photosynthetic plant that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers are usually small and white or pale in color, with a distinctive, orchid-like appearance. Thismia species are often found in association with specific fungal hosts, which is a key aspect of their ecological relationship."
