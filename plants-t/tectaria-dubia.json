    "intro": "Tectaria dubia, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its rhizomes to anchor itself while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are often divided into narrow segments and can vary in color depending on environmental conditions. Tectaria dubia is valued in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
