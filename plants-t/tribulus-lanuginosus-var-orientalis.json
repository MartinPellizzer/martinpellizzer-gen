    "intro": "Tribulus lanuginosus var. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny environments. The plant features delicate, feathery leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a hairy capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its spread in the wild. This species is often found in Mediterranean climates and is valued for its ornamental appearance and historical use in traditional medicine."
