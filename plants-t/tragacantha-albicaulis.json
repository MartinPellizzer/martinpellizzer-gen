    "intro": "Tragacantha albicaulis, commonly known as the white-stemmed tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a unique gum, known as tragacanth, which is harvested from its bark. This gum has been historically used in food, medicine, and as a binding agent. Tragacantha albicaulis thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrubland and woodland areas."
