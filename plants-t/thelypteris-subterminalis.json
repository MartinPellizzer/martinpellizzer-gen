    "intro": "Thelypteris subterminalis, commonly known as the southern shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to the soil. The spores are released from the fertile fronds, which are usually found on the lower part of the plant."
