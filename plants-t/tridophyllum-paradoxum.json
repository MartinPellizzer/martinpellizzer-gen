    "intro": "Tridophyllum paradoxum, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host tree. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using modified leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with both the host tree and the bird species that help propagate it. Tridophyllum paradoxum is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in dense, humid forests."
