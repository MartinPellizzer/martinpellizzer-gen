    "intro": "Trifolium trichocephalum var. lonchophyllum, commonly known as the long-leaf clover, is a variant of the common clover species. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often more slender than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
