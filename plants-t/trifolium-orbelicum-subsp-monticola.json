    "intro": "Trifolium orbelicum subsp. monticola, commonly known as the alpine clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It is adapted to cold climates and has a low-growing habit to withstand harsh weather conditions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in mountain ecosystems."
