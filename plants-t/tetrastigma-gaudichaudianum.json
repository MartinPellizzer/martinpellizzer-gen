It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and tendrils that aid in climbing. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by edible, grape-like berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and potentially useful in traditional medicine."
