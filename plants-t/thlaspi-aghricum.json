    "intro": "Thlaspi aghricum, commonly known as field pennycress, is an annual flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with simple, alternate leaves that are typically lobed or divided. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by triangular, papery pods containing seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Field pennycress is known for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts."
