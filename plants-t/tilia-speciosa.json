    "intro": "Tilia speciosa, commonly known as the bigleaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter. The tree produces fragrant, white, clustered flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, round fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Tilia speciosa is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
