    "intro": "Tillandsia usneoides f. robusta, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic bromeliad that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its fibrous, hair-like structures called trichomes. This variety is characterized by its dense, hanging clusters of soft, green filaments that can grow on trees, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. It plays a vital role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling. Despite its appearance, it is not parasitic and does not harm its host plant."
