    "intro": "Trophaeum rectangulum var. pallidum, commonly known as the pale-leafed stonecrop, is a succulent plant characterized by its fleshy, narrow leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. The leaves are typically grayish-green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, often blooming in spring. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
