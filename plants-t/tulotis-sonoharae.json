    "intro": "Tulotis sonoharae, commonly known as the Sonohara's tulip, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers during the spring season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tulotis sonoharae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
