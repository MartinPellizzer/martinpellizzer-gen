    "intro": "Tillandsia rubra var. reducta, commonly known as the Reducing Tillandsia, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth habit and vibrant red to orange flower bracts. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. This variety is prized for its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements in cultivation."
