    "intro": "Tillandsia rothschuhiana, commonly known as the Rothschild's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, misty environments. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of white or pale purple. Tillandsia rothschuhiana is well adapted to its natural habitat, requiring minimal soil and relying on atmospheric moisture for sustenance."
