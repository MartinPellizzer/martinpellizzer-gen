    "intro": "Tillandsia calamifolia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
