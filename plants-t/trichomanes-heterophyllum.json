    "intro": "Trichomanes heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually evergreen, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Trichomanes heterophyllum is notable for its variability in morphology, which can make identification challenging without careful examination."
