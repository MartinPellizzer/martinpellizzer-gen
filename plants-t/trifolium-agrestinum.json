    "intro": "Trifolium agrestinum, commonly known as the field clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Trifolium agrestinum is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant for soil enrichment."
