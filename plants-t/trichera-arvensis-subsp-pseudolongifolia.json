    "intro": "Trichera arvensis subsp. pseudolongifolia, commonly known as the slender false senna, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and has a fibrous root system. The plant features palmately compound leaves with 5-7 leaflets, and small yellow flowers arranged in racemes. Its fruits are pods that split open to release seeds, and it is often found in association with other weeds in agricultural areas. The species is characterized by its slender, erect stems and is relatively easy to identify due to its distinctive leaf structure."
