    "intro": "Tillandsia decurvata, commonly known as the curly tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often curled or twisted. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its foliage is typically gray-green with a waxy texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale pink. This species is popular among collectors due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
