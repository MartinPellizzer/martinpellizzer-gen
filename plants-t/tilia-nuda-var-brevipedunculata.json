    "intro": "Tilia nuda var. brevipedunculata, commonly known as the narrow pedunculate lime, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early summer. The tree produces small, round, greenish-brown fruits known as limes, which are typically eaten by birds and small mammals. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
