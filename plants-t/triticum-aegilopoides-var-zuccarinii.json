    "intro": "Triticum aegilopoides var. zuccarinii, commonly known as the wild wheat or goat grass, is a species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow to brown florets. It is closely related to cultivated wheat and has been studied for its potential in genetic research and as a source of disease resistance traits. Its botanical features make it an important wild relative in the study of wheat evolution and breeding."
