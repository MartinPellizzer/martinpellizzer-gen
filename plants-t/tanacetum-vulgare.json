    "intro": "Tanacetum vulgare, commonly known as tansy, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, yellowish-green leaves and small, button-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains compounds such as thujone and parthenolide, which contribute to its medicinal and pesticidal properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
