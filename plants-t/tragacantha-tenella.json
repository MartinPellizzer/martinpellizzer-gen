    "intro": "Tragacantha tenella, commonly known as the Persian gum plant, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Tragacantha tenella is often found in rocky soils and is resilient to drought conditions."
