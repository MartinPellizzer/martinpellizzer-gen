    "intro": "Taraxacum nordstedtii, commonly known as the Nordstedt's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to northern regions of Europe and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a fluffy white pappus for wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in parts of its range."
