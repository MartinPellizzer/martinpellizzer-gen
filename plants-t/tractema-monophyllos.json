    "intro": "Tractema monophyllos, commonly known as the single-leaf false nettle, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant has a single, broad leaf that is often mistaken for a fern, and it produces small, white flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Tractema monophyllos is typically found in the southeastern U.S. and is often overlooked due to its delicate appearance."
