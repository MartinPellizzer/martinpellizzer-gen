    "intro": "Tilia kwangtungensis, commonly known as the Kwangtung lime tree, is a deciduous tree native to southern China. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which appear before the leaves in early spring. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage and floral display."
