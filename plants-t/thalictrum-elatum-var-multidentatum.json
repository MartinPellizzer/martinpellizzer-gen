    "intro": "Thalictrum elatum var. multidentatum, commonly known as the showy meadow rue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky, white hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its delicate appearance and early spring blooming make it a notable wildflower in its native habitat."
