It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae, which includes species known for their showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, opposite leaves, and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
