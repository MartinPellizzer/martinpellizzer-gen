    "intro": "Tectaria cynthiae, commonly known as the Cynthia's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually dark green with a leathery texture, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Tectaria cynthiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
