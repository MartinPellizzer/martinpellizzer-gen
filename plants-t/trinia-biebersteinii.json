    "intro": "Trinia biebersteinii, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing vibrant pink or purple petals. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to minimize water loss in harsh environments. Trinia biebersteinii plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils."
