It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Myanmar, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by elongated, fibrous fruits. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
