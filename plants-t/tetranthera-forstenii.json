    "intro": "Tetranthera forstenii, commonly known as the Forsten's tetranthera, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems and small, opposite leaves. It produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, and it is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its family."
