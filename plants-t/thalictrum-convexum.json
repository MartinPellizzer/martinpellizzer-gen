    "intro": "Thalictrum convexum, commonly known as the convex meadow-rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as meadows and woodlands. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, hairy fruits that disperse seeds by wind. Thalictrum convexum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
