    "intro": "Trifolium thymiflorum, commonly known as sweet clover, is a member of the legume family (Fabaceae) and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, often arranged in racemes. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Sweet clover is also valued for its role in soil enrichment and as a forage crop for livestock."
