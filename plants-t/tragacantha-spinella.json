    "intro": "Tragacantha spinella, commonly known as the spiny tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a distinctive resinous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Tragacantha spinella is often found in rocky soils and is relatively drought-tolerant."
