    "intro": "Thelethylax insolata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant lacks leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are white and highly fragrant, often blooming in late summer. Due to its specialized habitat and declining population, it is listed as endangered in several states."
