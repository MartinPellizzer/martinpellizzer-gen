It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and melons, and is characterized by its climbing habit and tendrils. The plant produces small, green, and often fragrant flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its fruit is a small, round berry that turns from green to yellow as it matures. Thiloa colombiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
