    "intro": "Tripleurospermum maritimum subsp. boreale, commonly known as the northern sea daisy, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of northern Europe. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces daisy-like yellow flowers with white ray florets, typically blooming in late summer. It has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapting to its salty, windy environment. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh coastal conditions."
