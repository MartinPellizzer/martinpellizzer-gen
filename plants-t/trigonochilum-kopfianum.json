It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers with a unique coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding substrate, which is crucial for its survival in its natural habitat. The orchid's botanical features make it a subject of interest for both horticultural enthusiasts and botanical researchers."
