    "intro": "Thelypteris chlamydophora, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden-brown pubescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the forest floor. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
