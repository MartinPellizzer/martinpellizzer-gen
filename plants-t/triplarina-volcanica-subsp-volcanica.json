    "intro": "Triplarina volcanica subsp. volcanica, commonly known as the Volcanic Triplarina, is a rare and specialized plant native to high-altitude regions of Central America. It thrives in rocky, volcanic soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments with extreme temperature fluctuations. The plant features succulent leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often displaying vibrant colors to attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species facing threats from habitat destruction and climate change."
