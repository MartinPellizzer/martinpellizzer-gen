    "intro": "Tibetoseris, commonly known as the Tibetan bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. These plants are characterized by their compact growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. They typically thrive in alpine environments, where they adapt to cold temperatures and low oxygen levels. Tibetoseris species are often found in rocky soils and are well-suited to harsh, arid conditions. Due to their unique adaptations, they play an important role in the ecological balance of their native habitats."
