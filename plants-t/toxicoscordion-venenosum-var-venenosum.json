    "intro": "Toxicoscordion venenosum var. venenosum, commonly known as the death stalk, is a highly toxic plant native to arid regions of North America. It belongs to the genus Toxicoscordion, which is part of the family Amaryllidaceae. The plant produces a bulbous structure that contains alkaloids, making it extremely poisonous to both humans and animals. Its toxic properties are primarily due to the presence of compounds like lycorine and other alkaloids that can cause severe gastrointestinal distress and even fatalities. Due to its dangerous nature, it is often avoided in both natural and cultivated settings."
