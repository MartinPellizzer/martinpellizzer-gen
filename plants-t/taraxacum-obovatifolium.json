    "intro": "Taraxacum obovatifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, oval-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a fluffy seed head. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The leaves are typically covered in fine hairs and have a slightly bitter taste. It is a perennial plant that thrives in temperate climates and is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
