    "intro": "Typha latifolia var. elatior, commonly known as the tall bulrush, is a variant of the common cattail that is characterized by its taller and more robust growth compared to the standard variety. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, pond edges, and along the shores of lakes. The plant features narrow, blade-like leaves and produces cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. The plant plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by filtering water and supporting biodiversity."
