    "intro": "Tetrapterys crispa subsp. kunthiana, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
