    "intro": "Tresanthera, commonly known as the golden cupflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its showy, yellow or orange flowers that resemble small cups, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, Tresanthera species are typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plants have hairy stems and leaves, and they produce small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Tresanthera is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
