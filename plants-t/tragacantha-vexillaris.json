    "intro": "Tragacantha vexillaris, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. Tragacantha vexillaris is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in desert landscapes."
