    "intro": "Tetrapterys glabra f. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular-leafed tetrapterys, is a variant of the tetrapterys glabra species. It is a shrub native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its smooth, glandular leaves that are often covered in tiny, sticky secretions. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in axillary inflorescences. The glandular surface of the leaves is a notable botanical feature, possibly serving as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
