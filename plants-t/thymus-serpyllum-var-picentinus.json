    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. picentinus, commonly known as the Picentine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the limestone-rich regions of southern Europe. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in spring, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. It is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky soils and coastal areas. Its essential oils contain thymol and carvacrol, giving it a strong, pungent aroma and making it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications."
