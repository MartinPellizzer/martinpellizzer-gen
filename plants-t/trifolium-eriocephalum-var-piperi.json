    "intro": "Trifolium eriocephalum var. piperi, commonly known as the Mexican red clover, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Botanically, it is noted for its hairy calyx and the presence of glandular structures on its stems and leaves."
