    "intro": "Thelypteris invisa var. kunzeana, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus native to various regions in Asia and the Pacific. It is a perennial fern characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201350 cm in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in a distinctive, kidney-shaped arrangement. Its rhizome is creeping and covered with a layer of brown, fibrous tissue. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
