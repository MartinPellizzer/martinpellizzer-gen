    "intro": "Thea bachmaensis, commonly known as the Bachma tea plant, is a species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and serrated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elliptical, leathery fruits. The leaves are often used in traditional tea-making processes due to their aromatic properties. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils."
