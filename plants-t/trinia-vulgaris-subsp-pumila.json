    "intro": "Trinia vulgaris subsp. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf trinia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically forms dense mats of slender, hairy stems that are often prostrate or ascending. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered with fine pubescence. Small, greenish-white flowers are borne in clusters at the base of the leaves, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions."
