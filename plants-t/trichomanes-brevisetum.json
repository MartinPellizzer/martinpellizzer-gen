    "intro": "Trichomanes brevisetum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or decaying wood. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the leaves, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. The fronds are typically short and broad, with a distinctive, feathery appearance."
