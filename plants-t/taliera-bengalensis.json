    "intro": "Taliera bengalensis, commonly known as the Bengal talipot palm, is a tall, fan-shaped palm native to the wetlands of South and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, making it one of the largest palms in the world. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a branched inflorescence, followed by clustered fruits that are typically black when ripe. It thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in mangrove forests. Due to its size and ecological importance, it plays a significant role in the biodiversity of its native habitats."
