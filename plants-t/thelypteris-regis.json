    "intro": "Thelypteris regis, commonly known as the royal maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of its fertile fronds. Thelypteris regis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
