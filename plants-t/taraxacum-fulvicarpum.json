    "intro": "Taraxacum fulvicarpum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the dandelion family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its roots are fibrous and often form a dense mat. The plant produces a large number of small seeds that are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
