    "intro": "Tinnea arabica, commonly known as the Arabian tinnea, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to conserve water. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its resilience in harsh environments, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and traditional medicine."
