    "intro": "Trifolium mercedense, commonly known as the Merced clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stalk. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in early spring. Native to the western United States, it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Trifolium mercedense is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
