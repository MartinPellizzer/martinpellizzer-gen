    "intro": "Taraxacum officinale subsp. obovatum, commonly known as the broadleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizomes and a rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, hollow stem topped with a spherical inflorescence of yellow flowers that later develop into fluffy white seeds. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and as a food source for various insects."
