It is a vigorous climber with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces fragrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and yellow, blooming throughout the year in warm climates. Its climbing habit makes it suitable for trellises, walls, or as a ground cover. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
