    "intro": "Trachelospermum anceps, commonly known as the coral vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its vigorous climbing habit and clusters of fragrant, coral-colored flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves and produces small, red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Trachelospermum anceps is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a decorative vine in tropical landscapes."
