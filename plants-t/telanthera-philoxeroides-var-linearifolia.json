    "intro": "Telanthera philoxeroides var. linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf telanthera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It features slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red, often blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain environments."
