    "intro": "Taraxacum polytomum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, dark green leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which develop into fluffy white seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its diuretic and digestive benefits."
