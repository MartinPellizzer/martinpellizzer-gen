    "intro": "Thelypteris boridensis, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically broad and leathery. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help in spreading and anchoring the plant. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are often covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris boridensis thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks."
