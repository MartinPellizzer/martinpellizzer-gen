    "intro": "Tricharis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Tricharis is often found in moist, disturbed soils in tropical and subtropical regions. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
