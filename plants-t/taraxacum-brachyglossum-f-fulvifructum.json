    "intro": "Taraxacum brachyglossum f. fulvifructum, commonly known as the yellow false dandelion, is a variant of the brachyglossum dandelion species. It is characterized by its yellowish-orange flowers, which contrast with the typical white blooms of other dandelion species. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. It produces a hollow stem with a single flower head at the top, which develops into a seed ball upon maturity. This botanical variant is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in temperate climates."
