    "intro": "Trientalis europaea var. aleutica, commonly known as the Aleutian starflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Aleutian Islands and parts of Alaska. It features delicate, star-shaped white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and tundra environments. This variant is distinguished by its unique floral structure and adaptation to the harsh, northern climates."
