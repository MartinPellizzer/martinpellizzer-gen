    "intro": "Tessaria zamalloae, commonly known as the Zamalloa's tessaria, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous areas with cool temperatures. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tessaria zamalloae is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
