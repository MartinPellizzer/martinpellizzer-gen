    "intro": "Tetragonolobus erectus, commonly known as the erect tetraquile, is a perennial leguminous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its quadrangular, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemate inflorescences, which are followed by cylindrical, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and savanna habitats. Tetragonolobus erectus is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in agricultural and ecological restoration contexts."
