    "intro": "Tetraria, commonly known as the \"four-branch plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Poaceae, or grass family. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence structure, which consists of four branches that bear spikelets. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Tetraria species are generally low-growing and have narrow, grass-like leaves. These plants are not widely cultivated but are of interest to botanists due to their distinctive morphology and ecological adaptations."
