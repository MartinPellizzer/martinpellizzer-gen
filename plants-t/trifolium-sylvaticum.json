    "intro": "Trifolium sylvaticum, commonly known as wood clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in woodland and meadow habitats. Trifolium sylvaticum is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
