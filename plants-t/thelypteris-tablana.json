    "intro": "Thelypteris tablana, commonly known as the Table Mountain holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or pendulous. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help stabilize soil, making it ecologically significant in its habitat. Thelypteris tablana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful foliage."
