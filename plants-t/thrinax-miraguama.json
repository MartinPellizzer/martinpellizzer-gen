    "intro": "Thrinax miraguama, commonly known as the Miraguama palm, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a small, cold-tolerant palm that typically grows to a height of 3 to 5 meters. The plant has a slender trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Its leaves are pinnate, with long, narrow leaflets that give it a feathery appearance. Thrinax miraguama is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils."
