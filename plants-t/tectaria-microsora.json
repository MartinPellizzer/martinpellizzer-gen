    "intro": "Tectaria microsora, commonly known as the small-leaf tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread across moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Tectaria microsora is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
