    "intro": "Touchardia haupuensis, commonly known as the H\u0101p\u016b tree, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Hawai\u02bbi. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats within mesic to wet forest ecosystems, often found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
