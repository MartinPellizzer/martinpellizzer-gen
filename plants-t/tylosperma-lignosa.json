    "intro": "Tylosperma lignosa, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing hard, seed-like structures. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with deep roots and a thick cuticle to reduce water loss. Tylosperma lignosa is also valued for its potential medicinal uses and as a source of timber in some regions."
