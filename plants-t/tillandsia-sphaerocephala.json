    "intro": "Tillandsia sphaerocephala, commonly known as the globe-headed air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding structure. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
