    "intro": "Tetralocularia pennellii, commonly known as the Pennell's tetralocularia, is a rare and specialized plant species. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its unique floral structure. The plant is known for its intricate, four-chambered ovary, which is a defining botanical feature. It typically grows in specific, often moist and shaded habitats, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specialized requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
