    "intro": "Tillandsia weberi, commonly known as the Weber's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
