    "intro": "Toxicodendron wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family. It is native to the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan, growing in moist, shaded areas. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps in reducing water loss. The sap contains urushiol, a potent allergen that can cause severe skin irritation upon contact."
