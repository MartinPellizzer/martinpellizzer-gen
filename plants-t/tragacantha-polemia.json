    "intro": "Tragacantha polemia, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a resinous sap, which is harvested for its use in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Tragacantha polemia plays an important role in stabilizing soils in desert ecosystems."
