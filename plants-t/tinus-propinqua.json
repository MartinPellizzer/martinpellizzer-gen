    "intro": "Tinus propinqua, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, aromatic leaves that are narrow and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds. It is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in fynbos vegetation. Tinus propinqua is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh conditions."
