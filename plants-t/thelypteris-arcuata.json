    "intro": "Thelypteris arcuata, commonly known as the curl-leaf brake, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Thelypteris arcuata plays an important ecological role by contributing to forest floor cover and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
