    "intro": "Thymus lemnifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, fragrant, gray-green leaves that are narrow and densely arranged along its stems. The plant produces tiny, pink to lavender flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant ground cover. Its aromatic properties make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications."
