It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spider-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
