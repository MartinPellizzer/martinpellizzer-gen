    "intro": "Tinopsis conjugata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing resistance to drought and fire. Tinopsis conjugata is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in xeriscaped gardens."
