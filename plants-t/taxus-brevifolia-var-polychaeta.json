    "intro": "Taxus brevifolia var. polychaeta, commonly known as the Pacific yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its reddish-brown bark and flat, needle-like leaves that are typically 1\u20132 cm long. The plant produces small, reddish-purple berries that are toxic to most animals but serve as a food source for certain birds. It is notable for its medicinal properties, particularly the compound taxol, which is used in cancer treatments. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions."
