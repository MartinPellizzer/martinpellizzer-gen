    "intro": "Tetramerium surcubambense, commonly known as the Surubamba tetramerium, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rhizophoraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near riverbanks or in dense forests. Its flowers are small and clustered, with four petals, and it produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
