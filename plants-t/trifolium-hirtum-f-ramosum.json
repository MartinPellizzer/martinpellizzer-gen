    "intro": "Trifolium hirtum f. ramosum, commonly known as the hairy clover, is a variant of the common clover species. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Due to its hairy texture and compact growth habit, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
