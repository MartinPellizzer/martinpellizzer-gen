The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in mountainous environments. Thunia nivalis is a short-lived perennial, with a growth cycle adapted to the harsh conditions of its habitat."
