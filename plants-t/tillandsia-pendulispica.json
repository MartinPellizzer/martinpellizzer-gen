    "intro": "Tillandsia pendulispica, commonly known as the pendant air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, pendant-like inflorescences that give it its common name. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-shaped, arranged in a rosette pattern. Tillandsia pendulispica is well adapted to humid environments and can thrive with minimal soil, relying primarily on atmospheric moisture for sustenance."
