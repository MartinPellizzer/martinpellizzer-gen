It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit and small, aromatic leaves. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense spikes. Native to southern Europe, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
