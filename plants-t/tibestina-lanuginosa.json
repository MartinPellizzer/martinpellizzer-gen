    "intro": "Tibestina lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly tibestina, is a species of flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibesti Mountains in Chad. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the dry season. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its unique ecological role, it is considered an important indicator species for the region's biodiversity."
