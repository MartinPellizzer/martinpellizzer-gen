    "intro": "Tilia nuda var. glaucescens, commonly known as the white-barked linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark that becomes fissured with age, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins and a broad, rounded base. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles, which bloom in early summer and are followed by small, round fruits. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
