    "intro": "Tragacantha uliginosa, commonly known as the marsh tragacanth, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the eastern United States. It features a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in moist, often saturated soils. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to orange flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The plant is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in riparian zones and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
