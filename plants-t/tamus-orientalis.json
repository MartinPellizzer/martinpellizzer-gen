    "intro": "Tamus orientalis, commonly known as the oriental bitternut, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces distinctive, spiky, red-brown berries that are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture. Tamus orientalis is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions."
