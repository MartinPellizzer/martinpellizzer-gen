    "intro": "Trisetum glabrum, commonly known as the smooth false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and smooth, with a bluish-green color that becomes more pronounced in the summer. Trisetum glabrum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
