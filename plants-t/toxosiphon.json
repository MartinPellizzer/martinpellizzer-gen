    "intro": "Toxosiphon, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are primarily found in coastal regions, where they thrive in saline and sandy soils. Toxosiphon species are characterized by their striking, often blue or purple, ray florets and bristly stems. They have adapted to harsh maritime environments through specialized structures such as salt-excreting glands. The genus includes several species, with Toxosiphon bacciferus being one of the most well-known."
