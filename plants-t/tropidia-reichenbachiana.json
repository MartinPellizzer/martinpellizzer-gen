    "intro": "Tropidia reichenbachiana, commonly known as the Reichenbach's orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, greenish-yellow blooms with a distinct lip that is often more colorful than the rest of the flower. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by enthusiasts but is not widely commercially grown."
