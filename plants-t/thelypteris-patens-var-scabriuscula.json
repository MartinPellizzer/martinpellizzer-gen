    "intro": "Thelypteris patens var. scabriuscula, commonly known as the rough-leafed shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus Thelypteris. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its dimorphic fronds, with sterile fronds typically being longer and more slender than the fertile ones. The leaves are usually dark green and have a rough, scaly texture on the underside, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
