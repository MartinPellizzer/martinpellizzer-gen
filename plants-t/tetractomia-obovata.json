    "intro": "Tetractomia obovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf tetractomia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and showy, pentamerous flowers that typically bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
