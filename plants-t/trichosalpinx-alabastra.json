It is characterized by its striking, orange-yellow flowers that resemble a torch, with a distinctive spurred labellum. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store moisture in its native habitat. Trichosalpinx alabastra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
