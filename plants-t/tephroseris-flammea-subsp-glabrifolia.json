It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, orange-red bracts that resemble flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its smooth, hairless leaves, which contrast with the fuzzy leaves of other Tephroseris species. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and is often found in rocky soils. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and unique appearance."
