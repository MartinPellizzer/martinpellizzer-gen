    "intro": "Tephroseris turczaninovii subsp. reverdattoi, commonly known as the Reverdatto's tephroseris, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its botanical features include a slender stem and a basal rosette of leaves, which help it adapt to its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
