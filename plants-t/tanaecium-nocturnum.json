    "intro": "Tanaecium nocturnum, commonly known as the nightshade nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America and is characterized by its attractive, showy flowers that bloom at night. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. Tanaecium nocturnum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique nocturnal blooming habit. However, like many plants in the nightshade family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
