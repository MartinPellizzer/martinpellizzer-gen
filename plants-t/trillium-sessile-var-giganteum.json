    "intro": "Trillium sessile var. giganteum, commonly known as the giant yellow trillium, is a striking perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a single, showy yellow flower with three petals, three sepals, and three leaf-like bracts, all emerging from a single stem. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches, with broad, waxy leaves that are often tinged with green or red. It thrives in rich, moist woodlands and is known for its early spring blooming period. The species is relatively rare and is protected in many areas due to habitat loss and over-collection."
