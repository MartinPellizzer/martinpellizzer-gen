    "intro": "Tarachia angustata, commonly known as the narrowleaf cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that branch out into a dense, shrub-like structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a feature common in arid environments to minimize water loss. Tarachia angustata is well adapted to desert conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in extreme drought."
