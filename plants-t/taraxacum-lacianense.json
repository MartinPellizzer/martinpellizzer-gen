    "intro": "Taraxacum lacianense, commonly known as the Lician dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in countries like Italy and Greece. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
