    "intro": "Thelypteris wauensis, commonly known as the Wau fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in the understorey of dense forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Thelypteris wauensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic and ecological significance."
