    "intro": "Tillandsia sierrahalensis, commonly known as the Sierra Halense Air Plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to capture moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale pink. Tillandsia sierrahalensis is well-suited to humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
