    "intro": "Tephrocactus subterraneus, commonly known as the underground cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its subterranean growth habit, with most of its structure hidden beneath the soil surface. The plant produces short, cylindrical stems that emerge above ground during specific seasons. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters at the stem tips. Due to its rarity and specialized habitat, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in its native range."
