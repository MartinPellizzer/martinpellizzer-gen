    "intro": "Theodorea poljakowii, commonly known as the Poljakow's orchid, is a rare and exotic flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy blooms that typically feature vibrant hues of purple and white. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its unique morphology includes slender stems and delicate, lance-shaped leaves that support its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern and is rarely cultivated outside its native range."
