    "intro": "Trifolium lineare, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often arranged in clusters. Trifolium lineare is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in moist, temperate climates. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
