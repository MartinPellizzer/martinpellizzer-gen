    "intro": "Triaenophora integra, commonly known as the smooth triaenophora, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
