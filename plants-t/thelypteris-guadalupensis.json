    "intro": "Thelypteris guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupe shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into serrated segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Thelypteris guadalupensis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
