    "intro": "Tillaea inanis, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Tillaea inanis plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
