It is characterized by its basal rosette of glossy, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in early spring. It is often found in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and along stream banks. Thlaspi cardamine is known for its ability to thrive in cool, temperate climates and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
