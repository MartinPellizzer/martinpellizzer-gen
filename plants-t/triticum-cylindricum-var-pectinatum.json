    "intro": "Triticum cylindricum var. pectinatum, commonly known as the woolly wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive, cylindrical spikelets that give it its scientific name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species that thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological restoration and soil stabilization in dryland ecosystems."
