    "intro": "Tillandsia lymanii, commonly known as the Lyman's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, stiff leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it collect water and nutrients from the air. It produces striking orange to red flower spikes that bloom in the spring. Tillandsia lymanii is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright indirect light and regular misting to thrive."
