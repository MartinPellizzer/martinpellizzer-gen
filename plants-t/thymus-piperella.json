    "intro": "Thymus piperella, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are fragrant and used in culinary applications, while its compact growth makes it ideal for ground cover in gardens. Thymus piperella thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy and versatile plant for Mediterranean climates."
