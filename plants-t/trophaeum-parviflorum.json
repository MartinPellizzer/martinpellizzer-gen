    "intro": "Trophaeum parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flower rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal leaves that are linear to oblanceolate in shape, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
