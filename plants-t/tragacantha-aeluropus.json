    "intro": "Tragacantha aeluropus, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, featuring hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny shell, which helps protect them from predation and aids in seed dispersal."
