    "intro": "Tillandsia seemannii var. mezii, commonly known as the Mezii air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Due to its unique structure and ability to grow without soil, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
