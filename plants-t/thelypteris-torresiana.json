    "intro": "Thelypteris torresiana, commonly known as the Torres fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or cascading in appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to substrates while absorbing nutrients. Thelypteris torresiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
