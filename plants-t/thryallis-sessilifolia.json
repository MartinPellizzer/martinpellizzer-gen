It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its small, showy flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. Thryallis sessilifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
