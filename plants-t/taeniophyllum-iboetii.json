    "intro": "Taeniophyllum iboetii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in a spike. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its delicate nature and habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
