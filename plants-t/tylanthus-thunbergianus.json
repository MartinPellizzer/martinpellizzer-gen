    "intro": "Tylanthus thunbergianus, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It has opposite, simple, ovate leaves with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by woody, spherical fruits that split open to release seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
