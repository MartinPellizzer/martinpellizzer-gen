    "intro": "Tussilago farfara, commonly known as coltsfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of heart-shaped, velvety leaves that appear early in the spring. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are clustered in a cup-like structure called a involucre. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Tussilago farfara has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its expectorant properties."
