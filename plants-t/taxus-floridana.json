    "intro": "Taxus floridana, commonly known as the Florida yew, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and reddish-brown bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Taxus floridana is adapted to wet, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Due to its limited range and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
