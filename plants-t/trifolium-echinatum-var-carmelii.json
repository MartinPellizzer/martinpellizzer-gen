It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and chaparral habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
