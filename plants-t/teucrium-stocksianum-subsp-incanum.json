    "intro": "Teucrium stocksianum subsp. incanum, commonly known as the silver germander, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy foliage and small, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in ornamental gardening for its drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal. The subspecies incanum is distinguished by its silvery appearance, which is due to dense pubescence on its leaves and stems."
