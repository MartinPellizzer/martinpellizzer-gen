    "intro": "Thelypteris ramosii, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its bipinnate fronds that are often divided into narrow, delicate segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are usually short and produce a dense network of roots, which helps anchor it to substrates like soil or rock. Thelypteris ramosii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage, which adds a refined texture to gardens and landscapes."
