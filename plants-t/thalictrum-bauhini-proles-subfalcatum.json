    "intro": "Thalictrum bauhini proles subfalcatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers arranged in compound umbels, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
