    "intro": "Taraxacum officinale f. commutatum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a variant of the common dandelion. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and is often found in meadows and grasslands. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and lobed. Its flowers are borne on a hollow stem and produce seeds with feathery parachutes for wind dispersal. This form is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical dandelion."
