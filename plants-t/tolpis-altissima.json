    "intro": "Tolpis altissima, commonly known as the tall flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Africa and parts of Asia. It typically grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that are often inconspicuous, with the showy bracts playing a key role in attracting pollinators. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Tolpis altissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in maintaining wetland biodiversity."
