    "intro": "Trichocereus atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama torch cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a feature common among many cacti in the Cactaceae family. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in extreme desert conditions. Trichocereus atacamensis is also known for its role in traditional practices and its association with hallucinogenic compounds."
