    "intro": "Typha martini var. davidiana, commonly known as David's cattail, is a marsh plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that stand above the broad, sword-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, pond edges, and other water-saturated environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
