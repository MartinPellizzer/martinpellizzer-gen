    "intro": "Thylacopteris, commonly known as the fern-like plant of the genus Thylacopteris, is a group of plants belonging to the family Thylacopteridaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique fronds that resemble ferns, though they are not true ferns. Thylacopteris species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. They have a simple structure with a rhizome and are known for their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The genus is of particular interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance and distinct morphological features."
