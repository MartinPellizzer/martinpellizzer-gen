    "intro": "Tetrouratea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, with five petals that are usually pink or purple in color. Tetrouratea species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are often found in moist, shaded environments. These plants are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
