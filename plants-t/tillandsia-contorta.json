    "intro": "Tillandsia contorta, commonly known as the twisted air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal direct sunlight. Tillandsia contorta is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
