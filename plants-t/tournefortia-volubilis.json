    "intro": "Tournefortia volubilis, commonly known as the climbing tournefortia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or vine that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in coastal areas and along riverbanks. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a rough texture, while its fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature. Tournefortia volubilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
