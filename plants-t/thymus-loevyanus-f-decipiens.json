    "intro": "Thymus loevyanus f. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive thyme, is a rare and lesser-known subspecies of thyme native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun exposure. Its medicinal properties are similar to those of common thyme, though it is less commonly used in herbal medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
