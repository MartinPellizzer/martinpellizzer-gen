It features slender, erect stems that produce showy, yellow to orange-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous, giving it its subspecific name. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological importance in native habitats."
