    "intro": "Tanacetum pyrethroides, commonly known as the pyrethrum plant, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces a volatile oil rich in pyrethroids, which are natural insecticides used in organic pest control. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in dry, open habitats. Due to its chemical properties, it is widely cultivated for both ornamental and agricultural purposes."
