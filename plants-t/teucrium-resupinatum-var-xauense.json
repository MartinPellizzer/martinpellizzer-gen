    "intro": "Teucrium resupinatum var. xauense, commonly known as the Mexican germander, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
