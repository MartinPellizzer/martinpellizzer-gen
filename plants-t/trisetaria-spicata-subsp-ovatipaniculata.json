    "intro": "Trisetaria spicata subsp. ovatipaniculata, commonly known as the broad-leaf panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a stabilizing plant in wet areas."
