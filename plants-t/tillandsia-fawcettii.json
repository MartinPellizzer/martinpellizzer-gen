    "intro": "Tillandsia fawcettii, commonly known as the Fawcett's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that collect water and nutrients from the air. The plant lacks traditional roots and absorbs moisture through its leaf surfaces. It produces striking inflorescences with showy, violet-colored flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its unique growth habits and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
