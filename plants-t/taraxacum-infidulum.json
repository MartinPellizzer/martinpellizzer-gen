    "intro": "Taraxacum infidulum, commonly known as the slender dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow flower head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It produces a distinctive, hollow stem with a milky sap that is characteristic of the genus Taraxacum. The flowers develop into a fluffy, white pappus that aids in seed dispersal by wind."
