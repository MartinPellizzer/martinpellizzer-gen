It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and heart-shaped basal leaves, typical of the dandelion genus. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers bloom in early spring, followed by the formation of a distinctive seed head. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation interest."
