    "intro": "Trapa longicornis, commonly known as the longhorn water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive floating leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with long, stiff hairs along the edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface, followed by spiny, woody fruits. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in muddy or sandy bottoms of freshwater habitats. Trapa longicornis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
