    "intro": "Thelesperma subnudum var. marginatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with a distinctive white or pale green margin. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The species is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
