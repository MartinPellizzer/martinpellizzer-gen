    "intro": "Tribulus terrestris var. inermis, commonly known as goathead, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It features prostrate or ascending stems that are often hairy, with small, spiny leaves that are trifoliate or palmately lobed. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into distinctive, spiny fruits containing three to five seeds. It is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Its botanical characteristics make it adaptable to various environments, contributing to its widespread distribution."
