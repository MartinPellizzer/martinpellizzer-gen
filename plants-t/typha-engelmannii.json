    "intro": "Typha engelmannii, commonly known as Engelmann's cattail, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that produce fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense colonies in marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its leaves are long, narrow, and slightly hairy, while its rhizomes help stabilize the soil. Engelmann's cattail plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
