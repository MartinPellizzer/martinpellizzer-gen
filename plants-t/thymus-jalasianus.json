    "intro": "Thymus jalasianus, commonly known as the Jordanian thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the rocky regions of Jordan and parts of the Middle East. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by aromatic essential oils and square stems. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are fragrant and often used in traditional medicine for their antimicrobial and antifungal properties. Thymus jalasianus is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
