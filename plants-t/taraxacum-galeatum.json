It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaves. The plant features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces a hollow, elongated stem topped with a yellow flower head. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Taraxacum galeatum is noted for its resilience to cold climates and its ability to colonize disturbed or marginal habitats."
