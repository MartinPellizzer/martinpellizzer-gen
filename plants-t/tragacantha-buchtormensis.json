    "intro": "Tragacantha buchtormensis, commonly known as the Buchtorm tragakanta, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant produces a unique resinous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowering stems are typically erect, bearing small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale pink in color."
