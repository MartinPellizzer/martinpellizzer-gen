    "intro": "Tithymalus \u00d7 macinensis, commonly known as the hybrid tithymalus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Tithymalus \u00d7 macinensis is often found in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in the wild."
