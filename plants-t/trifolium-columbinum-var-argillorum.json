    "intro": "Trifolium columbinum var. argillorum, commonly known as the claybank clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. It thrives in moist, clay-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
