It typically grows in woodland and rocky habitats, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of elliptic, glossy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. Its showy, five-petaled flowers, which are usually white or pale pink, bloom in early spring. Tractema verna is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting early pollinators."
