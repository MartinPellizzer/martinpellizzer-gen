    "intro": "Theodorea przewalzkii, commonly known as the Przewalski's lily, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and neighboring areas. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation status."
