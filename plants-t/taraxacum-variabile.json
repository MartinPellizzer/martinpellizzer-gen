    "intro": "Taraxacum variabile, commonly known as the variable dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its life cycle includes a rosette of leaves followed by a flowering stem that produces a parachute-like seed head. The species is known for its variability in leaf shape and flower color, which contributes to its common name."
