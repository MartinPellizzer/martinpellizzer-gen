    "intro": "Taraxacum dissonum, commonly known as the dissonous dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to central and eastern Europe and is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, hollow stem that supports a bright yellow flower head, which later develops into a spherical seed sphere with white pappus. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
