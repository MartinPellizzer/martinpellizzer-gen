It is characterized by its vivid orange or yellow flowers, which are typically solitary and borne on erect, leafy stems. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or heathlands. Its unique floral structure includes a spurred lip and a distinctive column, typical of many orchid species.
