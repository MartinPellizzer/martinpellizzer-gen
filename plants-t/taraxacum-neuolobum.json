    "intro": "Taraxacum neuolobum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a stem that bears a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism with a pappus of fine hairs that allows the seeds to be carried by the wind. It is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats across North America. Taraxacum neuolobum is often considered a weed but has ecological and historical significance in traditional medicine."
