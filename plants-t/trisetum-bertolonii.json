    "intro": "Trisetum bertolonii, commonly known as the Bertoloni's wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Trisetum bertolonii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
