    "intro": "Thymus diffusus, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features tiny, aromatic leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover in gardens and rocky landscapes. Botanically, it belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and opposite leaves."
