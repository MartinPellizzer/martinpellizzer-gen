    "intro": "Taraxacum officinale var. leptocephalum, commonly known as the slender-headed dandelion, is a variant of the common dandelion characterized by its elongated, narrow flower heads. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers produce a distinctive spherical seed head, which releases lightweight seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. This variant is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
