    "intro": "Trichomanes armstrongii, commonly known as Armstrong's fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae, which includes many epiphytic and lithophytic ferns. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are narrow and delicate, with a distinctive appearance that resembles a feather. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
