    "intro": "Trochocephalus argenteus subsp. wulfenii, commonly known as the silverleaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
