    "intro": "Tirtalia, commonly known as the sacred lotus of Bali, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and red, with a distinctive pinkish hue on the petals. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it to the muddy substrate. Tirtalia is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens for its aesthetic value and spiritual significance. Its growth cycle is closely tied to the monsoon season, making it a symbol of renewal and purity in Balinese culture."
