    "intro": "Thouinia scoparia, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds with silky hairs for wind dispersal. Its leaves are hairy and succulent, helping to reduce water loss. Thouinia scoparia is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its resilience in harsh environments."
