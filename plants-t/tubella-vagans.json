    "intro": "Tubella vagans, commonly known as the wandering tube worm, is a species of polychaete worm found in marine environments. It belongs to the family Scolopariidae and is characterized by its elongated, segmented body. The worm's name reflects its ability to move along the substrate, often in search of food. Its body is covered in cilia, which aid in locomotion and feeding. Tubella vagans plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling through its feeding activities."
