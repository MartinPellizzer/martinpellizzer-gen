    "intro": "Trichinium chrysurus, commonly known as the golden thread fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a yellowish hue on the underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce sporangia that release spores for reproduction. Trichinium chrysurus is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
