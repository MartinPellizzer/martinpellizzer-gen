    "intro": "Tulipa biflora afghanica, commonly known as the Afghan double tulip, is a rare and striking member of the tulip family native to Afghanistan. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, purple, and white, with two distinct layers of petals. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is adapted to the arid and mountainous environments of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
