    "intro": "Tragopyrum lanceolatum, commonly known as the slender burweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Tragopyrum lanceolatum is typically found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments."
