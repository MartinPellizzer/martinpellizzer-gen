    "intro": "Triticum monococcum var. pseudobaeticum, commonly known as the wild emmer wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and spikelet structure typical of the Poaceae family. The plant produces small, two-rowed spikes with glumes that enclose the florets. It has narrow, linear leaves and is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and resilience to environmental stress."
