    "intro": "Trifolium axillare, commonly known as the axillary trefoil, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on either side of a central stalk. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. Native to southern Africa, it thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments. Trifolium axillare is a perennial herb that plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility."
