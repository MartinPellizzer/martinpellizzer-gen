    "intro": "Thymus azoricus, commonly known as Azorean thyme, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Azores. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic, gray-green leaves that emit a strong thyme scent when crushed. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Thymus azoricus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its use in traditional herbal remedies."
