It is native to South America, specifically found in regions of Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in grassy areas or along the edges of forests. Trifolium pilczii is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a potential forage plant for livestock."
