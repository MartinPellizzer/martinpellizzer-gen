    "intro": "Triticum subspontaneum, commonly known as wild wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish florets. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its genetic similarity to cultivated wheat, it is of interest in agricultural and evolutionary studies."
