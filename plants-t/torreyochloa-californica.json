    "intro": "Torreyochloa californica, commonly known as California needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in arid and semi-arid regions."
