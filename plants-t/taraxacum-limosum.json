    "intro": "Taraxacum limosum, commonly known as the bog dandelion, is a perennial herb native to wetland and bog environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a distinctive, hollow, spiky seed capsule. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshy areas. Its botanical characteristics make it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
