It is a shrub characterized by its compact, subglobular growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
