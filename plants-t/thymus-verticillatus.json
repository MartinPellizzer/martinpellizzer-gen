    "intro": "Thymus verticillatus, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features dense, fragrant foliage with small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and aromatic properties. Thymus verticillatus is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and ground cover."
