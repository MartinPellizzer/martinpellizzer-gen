    "intro": "Trachypogon plumosus subvar. secundus, commonly known as the slender feathergrass, is a grass species native to parts of Australia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and delicate, feathery inflorescences that give it a soft, plume-like appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. It is a low-growing perennial with rhizomes, and its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer. The subvariety secundus is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to the main species."
