    "intro": "Thalictrum pubescens var. hebecarpum, commonly known as the woolly meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, branched stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are compound, with lance-shaped leaflets that are also covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. This variety is often found in moist meadows and woodland edges, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil."
