    "intro": "Touchardia wailauensis, commonly known as the Wailau mountain pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the high elevations of the Hawaiian island of Maui. This coniferous tree is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in spirals. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Touchardia wailauensis is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
