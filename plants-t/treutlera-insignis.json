    "intro": "Treutlera insignis, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that grows from a bulbous stem, which allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in the spring, often after rain. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, reducing water loss through transpiration. Treutlera insignis is adapted to extreme temperatures and can go dormant during prolonged droughts."
