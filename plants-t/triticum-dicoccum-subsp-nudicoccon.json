    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum subsp. nudicoccon, commonly known as naked barley, is a wild cereal grain native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its reduced awns and a hull that detaches more easily from the grain compared to other barley varieties. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a panicle-type inflorescence. Its seeds are small, ranging from 2 to 4 mm in length, and are usually light yellow to brown in color. This subspecies is known for its hardiness and ability to thrive in cooler, high-altitude environments."
