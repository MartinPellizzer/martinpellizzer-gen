    "intro": "Trifolium acaule, commonly known as the leafless clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its absence of a stem, with leaves directly emerging from the root system. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
