    "intro": "Tritoniopsis latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf tritoniopsis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers, which range in color from pale pink to white, attract various pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tritoniopsis latifolia is considered a species of conservation concern."
