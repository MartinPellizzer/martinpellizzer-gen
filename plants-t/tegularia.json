    "intro": "Tegularia, commonly known as the common tansy, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and yellowish-green flower heads that contain numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and marshes. Tegularia is known for its strong, often unpleasant odor, which is attributed to the presence of volatile oils. It is also noted for its medicinal uses in traditional herbal remedies."
