    "intro": "Trifolium amphianthum, commonly known as the southern clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters. It is native to regions of South America and thrives in temperate climates. Trifolium amphianthum is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
