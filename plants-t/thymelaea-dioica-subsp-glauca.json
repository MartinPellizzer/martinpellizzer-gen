    "intro": "Thymelaea dioica subsp. glauca, commonly known as the glaucous thymelaea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its leaves are usually covered in a waxy, bluish coating. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and drought tolerance, making it well adapted to its native habitat. The subspecies is distinguished by its glaucous appearance, which provides protection against excessive sunlight and water loss."
