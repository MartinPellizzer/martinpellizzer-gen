    "intro": "Trichomanes meyenianum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged along the margins of the fronds. Trichomanes meyenianum is noted for its intricate leaf venation and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in humid, low-light conditions."
