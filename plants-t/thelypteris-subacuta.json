It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori. Thelypteris subacuta is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
