    "intro": "Tristichocalyx diffusa, commonly known as the silky ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, greyish bark. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, red berries. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in dry forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
