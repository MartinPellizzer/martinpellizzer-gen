    "intro": "Thelypteris oppositipinna, commonly known as the opposite-pinnate water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bipinnate, with pinnae arranged oppositely along the rachis. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates such as soil or decaying wood. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering."
