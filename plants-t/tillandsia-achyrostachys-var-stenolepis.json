    "intro": "Tillandsia achyrostachys var. stenolepis, commonly known as the silver leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often attaching itself to trees in humid environments. Its leaves are narrow, silver-gray in color, and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental appeal. It is relatively easy to care for, requiring minimal soil and regular misting to maintain humidity."
