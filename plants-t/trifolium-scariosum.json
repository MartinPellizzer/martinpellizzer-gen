    "intro": "Trifolium scariosum, commonly known as the scarious clover, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Trifolium scariosum thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and it is often found in disturbed soils. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration efforts."
