    "intro": "Triticum sativum f. velutinum, commonly known as the velvety wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its soft, silky texture on the leaves and stems. This form is typically found in cooler climates and is often cultivated for its unique aesthetic qualities rather than for grain production. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with shorter, more densely packed leaves compared to the standard wheat variety. It is also noted for its increased resistance to certain fungal diseases, making it a valuable subject in agricultural research. Its ornamental value has led to its use in specialty seed markets and botanical gardens."
