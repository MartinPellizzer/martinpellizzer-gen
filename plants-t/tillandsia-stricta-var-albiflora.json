    "intro": "Tillandsia stricta var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil for growth, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its foliage. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, and it produces clusters of small, white flowers. It is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its ability to grow without soil makes it an excellent example of an air plant adapted to tropical climates."
