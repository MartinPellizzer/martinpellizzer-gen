    "intro": "Trichomanes nicobaricum, commonly known as the Nicobar maidenhair fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the Nicobar Islands. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in moist crevices. Its reproductive structures, called soruses, are small and clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat destruction and climate change."
