    "intro": "Toumeya schmiedickeana var. klinkeriana, commonly known as the Klinkeriana toumeya, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions in Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
