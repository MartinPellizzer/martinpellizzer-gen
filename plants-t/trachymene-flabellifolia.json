It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, heart-shaped to ovate leaves with a distinctive veining pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Trachymene flabellifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy habitats. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and delicate floral display."
