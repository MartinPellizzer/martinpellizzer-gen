It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features slender, branched stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are surrounded by whorls of finely divided, feathery leaves. Its foliage is characterized by delicate, lace-like leaves that are alternate and pinnately compound. Thalictrum firmum prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
