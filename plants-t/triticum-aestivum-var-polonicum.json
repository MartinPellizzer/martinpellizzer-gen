    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. polonicum, commonly known as Polish wheat, is a variety of common wheat native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its robust growth habit and high yield potential, making it well-suited for temperate climates. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with long, narrow leaves and spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-lobed grains. It has a short growing season and is often cultivated for its hardiness and adaptability to various soil types. This variety is particularly valued for its use in bread and pasta production due to its high gluten content."
