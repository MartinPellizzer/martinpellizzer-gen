    "intro": "Tectaria trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are divided into three lobes. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its fronds are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales, which help reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Tectaria trifida is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
