    "intro": "Trifolium longipes subsp. neurophyllum, commonly known as the long-stemmed clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The flowers are small, pinkish-white, and borne in dense, globular heads, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes. This subspecies is distinguished by its slightly elongated stem and subtle floral coloration compared to other Trifolium species."
