    "intro": "Thalictrum foetidum var. iwatense, commonly known as the Izu meadow rue, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. It is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
