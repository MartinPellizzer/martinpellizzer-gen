    "intro": "Trineuron nivigenum, commonly known as the frostbloom lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking white petals that resemble snowflakes, hence its common name. The plant has a short, sturdy stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery\u7ed2\u6bdb. It blooms in late winter, producing clusters of delicate flowers that are pollinated primarily by cold-adapted bees. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to climate change, Trineuron nivigenum is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
