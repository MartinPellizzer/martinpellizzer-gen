    "intro": "Trifolium grossheimii, commonly known as the Grossheim's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and produces small, pink to purple flowers in early spring. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
