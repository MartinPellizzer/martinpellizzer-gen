    "intro": "Tarasa capitata, commonly known as the tall goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of flowers. The plant features upright, branched stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and slightly serrated. It produces bright yellow flowers in late summer to early autumn, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tarasa capitata is often found in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
