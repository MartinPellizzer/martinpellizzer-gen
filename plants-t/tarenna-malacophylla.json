    "intro": "Tarenna malacophylla, commonly known as the Malacophylla tarenna, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which are often lobed and have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries. Tarenna malacophylla is often found in moist, shaded habitats within the rainforest understory. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
