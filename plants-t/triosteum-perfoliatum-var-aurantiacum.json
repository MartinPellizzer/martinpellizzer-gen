It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, adding to its ornamental value. Its stems are square and hairy, and the flowers are borne in clusters at the leaf axils. This variety is known for its unique perfoliate leaves, which are perforated at the base, allowing the stem to pass through."
