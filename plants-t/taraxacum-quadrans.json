    "intro": "Taraxacum quadrans, commonly known as the four-lobed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that form a basal rosette. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a spherical, wind-dispersed seed sphere. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a common and recognizable weed in many regions."
