    "intro": "Tragacantha lyallii, commonly known as the Lyall's tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or pea family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces a valuable gum from its bark, which has been historically used in traditional M\u0101ori medicine. It thrives in coastal and forested areas, often found in the North Island of New Zealand. Due to habitat loss, it is now considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
