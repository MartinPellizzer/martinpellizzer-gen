    "intro": "Tillandsia seleriana, commonly known as the Seler's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage, which is covered in dense, hair-like trichomes that help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil for growth. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of white or pale pink. Tillandsia seleriana is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
