    "intro": "Taraxacum rubrinerve, commonly known as the red-veined dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets and distinctive red veins in its leaves. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are typically basal, with a rough, hairy texture, and the stem is hollow and ridged. The flower heads produce a fluffy seed head that disperses seeds via the wind, aiding in its propagation."
