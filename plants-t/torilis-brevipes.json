    "intro": "Torilis brevipes, commonly known as the short-footed hedge mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and features small, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, round seed pods. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and short life cycle make it a common weed in agricultural areas."
