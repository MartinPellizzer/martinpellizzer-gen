    "intro": "Therolepta, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying solely on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant features a single, showy white or pale green flower with a distinctive, elongated lip. It thrives in specific, moist, sandy habitats and is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its limited distribution and ecological fragility, Therolepta is considered an endangered species."
