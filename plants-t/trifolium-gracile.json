    "intro": "Trifolium gracile, commonly known as slender clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, grassy habitats. Trifolium gracile is often found in meadows and along streambanks, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
