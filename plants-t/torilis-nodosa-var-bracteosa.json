It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from May to July. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to spread across various habitats."
