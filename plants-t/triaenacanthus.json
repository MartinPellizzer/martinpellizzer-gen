    "intro": "Triaenacanthus, commonly known as the three-pronged sea urchin, is a type of echinoderm rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects. It belongs to the class Echinoidea and is characterized by its spherical body covered in spines. These spines serve as a defense mechanism against predators. Triaenacanthus species are typically found in marine environments, particularly in shallow coastal waters. They play a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the structure of benthic habitats."
