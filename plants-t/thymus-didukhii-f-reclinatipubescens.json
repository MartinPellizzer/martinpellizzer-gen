    "intro": "Thymus didukhii f. reclinatipubescens, commonly known as the creeping pubescent thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, aromatic leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The essential oils found in its leaves contribute to its use in culinary and medicinal applications."
