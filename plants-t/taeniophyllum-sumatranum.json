    "intro": "Taeniophyllum sumatranum, commonly known as the Sumatran star moss, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in the humid, shaded environments of tropical rainforests. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, star-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant is native to the island of Sumatra and is adapted to grow on trees, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an important indicator species for undisturbed forest ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
