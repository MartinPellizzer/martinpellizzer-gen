    "intro": "Trichopyrum, commonly known as the false oat, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are annual or biennial herbs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Trichopyrum species are often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and are adapted to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Their ecological role includes contributing to soil stabilization and serving as a food source for certain insects and small herbivores."
