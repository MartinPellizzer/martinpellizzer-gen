    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. quasimeridionale-inflatum, commonly known as the southern wheat variant, is a less commonly cultivated subspecies of common wheat. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter, more robust stalks compared to standard wheat varieties. The plant exhibits a unique floret structure with inflated, elongated glumes that give it a distinctive appearance. It is adapted to warmer climates and is often found in regions with a Mediterranean climate. Botanically, it is noted for its genetic diversity and potential for use in breeding programs aimed at improving heat tolerance in wheat crops."
