    "intro": "Tetrodon petrophilus, commonly known as the rock puffer, is a small marine fish belonging to the family Tetraodontidae. It is characterized by its distinctive rounded body and spiny dorsal fin, which it can inflate when threatened. This species is typically found in shallow coastal waters and rocky habitats across the Indo-Pacific region. The rock puffer feeds primarily on algae, small invertebrates, and detritus. Its ability to change color and blend with its surroundings helps it avoid predators."
