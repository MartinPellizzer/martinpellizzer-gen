    "intro": "Tripogon major, commonly known as the giant sedge, is a tall, perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments in southern Africa. It is characterized by its robust, triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Tripogon major is also valued for its ornamental appeal in water garden settings."
