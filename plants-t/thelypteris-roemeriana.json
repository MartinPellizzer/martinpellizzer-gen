    "intro": "Thelypteris roemeriana, commonly known as the Roemer's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and often form thick, mat-like growths on the forest floor. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Thelypteris roemeriana thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland habitats."
