    "intro": "Tetraria aristata, commonly known as the arrowhead lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its thallus that is typically green to yellowish-green in color, with a finely granular texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide photosynthetic capabilities, while the fungal component offers structural support and protection. It is often found growing on tree bark, especially in humid and shaded environments. Tetraria aristata is widely distributed across temperate regions and is notable for its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
