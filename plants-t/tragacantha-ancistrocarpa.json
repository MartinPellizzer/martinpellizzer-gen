    "intro": "Tragacantha ancistrocarpa, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. The plant produces a milky sap that can be used to make a type of gum, though it is less commercially valuable than other tragacanth species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in rocky soils and along riverbanks. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, and the plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
