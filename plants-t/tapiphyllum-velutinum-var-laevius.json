    "intro": "Tapiphyllum velutinum var. laevius, commonly known as the velvetleaf smooth variant, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it is considered an invasive species in some areas."
