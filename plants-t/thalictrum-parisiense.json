    "intro": "Thalictrum parisiense, commonly known as meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Thalictrum parisiense is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and early spring blooms."
