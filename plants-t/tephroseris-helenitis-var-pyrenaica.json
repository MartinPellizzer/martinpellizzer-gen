    "intro": "Tephroseris helenitis var. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean tephroseris, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Pyrenees Mountains. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its small, white flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
