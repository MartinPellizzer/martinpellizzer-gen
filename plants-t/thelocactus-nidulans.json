    "intro": "Thelocactus nidulans, commonly known as the crested cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its most distinctive feature is the presence of a crown of spines, which gives it a crested appearance. Thelocactus nidulans is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions with minimal water and high sunlight exposure."
