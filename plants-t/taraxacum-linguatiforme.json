    "intro": "Taraxacum linguatiforme, commonly known as the tongue-shaped dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces a single, hollow, stem that ends in a bright yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. After flowering, it develops a distinctive, fluffy white pappus that aids in seed dispersal by wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas."
