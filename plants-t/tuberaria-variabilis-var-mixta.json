    "intro": "Tuberaria variabilis var. mixta, commonly known as the hybrid rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Cistaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces yellow or orange flowers with a distinctive tubular shape, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are evergreen, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Tuberaria variabilis var. mixta is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its hardy and low-maintenance characteristics."
