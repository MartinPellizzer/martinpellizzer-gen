    "intro": "Thelypteris torresiana var. calvata, commonly known as the smooth fern, is a variant of the tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically dark green and smooth to the touch. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its elegant appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in tropical and subtropical regions."
