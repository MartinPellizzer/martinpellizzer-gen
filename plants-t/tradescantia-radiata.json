    "intro": "Tradescantia radiata, commonly known as spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It features striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet, often with a distinctive purple or red throat. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. It is a perennial herb that produces seeds in small, three-lobed capsules. Tradescantia radiata is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it both a popular garden plant and a potential weed."
