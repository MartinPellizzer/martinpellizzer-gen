    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum subsp. britannicus, commonly known as British thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to western Europe. It features aromatic, narrow leaves and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its use in culinary and medicinal applications. This subspecies is closely related to other thyme species but is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and slightly different morphological traits."
