    "intro": "Taraxacum rivulare, commonly known as the water dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, hollow stem that rises to bear a yellow flower head. The plant thrives in moist, often calcareous soils near water sources such as streams and wet meadows. Its flowers are typically followed by a spherical, prickly seed head that aids in wind dispersal. Taraxacum rivulare is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
