    "intro": "Triticum hispanicum, commonly known as Spanish wheat, is a wild grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-rowed grains. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as fields and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. Triticum hispanicum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils."
