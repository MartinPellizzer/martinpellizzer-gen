    "intro": "Tillandsia turquinensis, commonly known as the Turquin air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
