    "intro": "Taraxacum angusticeps, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, upright leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, wind-dispersed seed stem known as a pappus. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it a common weed but also an important species in ecological studies."
