    "intro": "Trillium recurvatum f. luteum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered trillium, is a rare and striking variant of the trillium genus native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow petals, which contrast with its dark green foliage and showy, three-lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands, thriving in rich, well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, adding a unique visual element to the forest floor. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
