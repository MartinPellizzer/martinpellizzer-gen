It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers and distinctive, pectinate (toothed) leaves. The plant is native to parts of Asia and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It produces a hollow, wind-dispersed seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. The species is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
