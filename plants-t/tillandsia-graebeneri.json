    "intro": "Tillandsia graebeneri, commonly known as the Graebner's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Tillandsia graebeneri is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
