It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in humid conditions. Thelypteris indochinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
