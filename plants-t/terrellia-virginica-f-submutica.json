    "intro": "Terrellia virginica f. submutica, commonly known as the smoothleaf terrellia, is a rare and distinctive fern species native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are typically smooth on the underside. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of its leaves, which are arranged in a unique, spiral pattern. Its habitat is usually moist, shaded woodlands, where it thrives in rich, organic soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
