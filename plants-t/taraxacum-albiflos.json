    "intro": "Taraxacum albiflos, commonly known as the white-flowered dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, pale green leaves and a long, hollow stem that terminates in a bright yellow flower head. The flowers are surrounded by a pappus of white, feathery bracts that aid in wind pollination. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in a variety of soil types, including disturbed and open habitats. It is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
