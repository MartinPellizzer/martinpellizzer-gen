    "intro": "Tillandsia tomasellii, commonly known as the Tomasellii air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Mexico. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil for growth, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in capturing water and sunlight. It produces striking pink or red inflorescences that bloom from the center of the rosette. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
