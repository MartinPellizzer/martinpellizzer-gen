It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by small, spherical berries. Tarenna elongata is often found in moist, shaded forest environments, where it thrives in the understory. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
