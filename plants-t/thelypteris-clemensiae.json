    "intro": "Thelypteris clemensiae, commonly known as the Clemens' water fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread along the ground or water surfaces. Its sori, which are clusters of sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically near the margins. Thelypteris clemensiae thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and swampy areas."
