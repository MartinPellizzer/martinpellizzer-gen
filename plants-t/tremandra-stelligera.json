It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. It has a low-growing habit and is adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. Tremandra stelligera plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
