    "intro": "Thalictrum linnaeanum, commonly known as the Linnaean meadow-rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring finely divided, fern-like leaves that are alternate along the stem. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, arranged in clusters at the top of the stems. Its flowers are actinomorphic and have numerous stamens, making it an attractive species for pollinators. Thalictrum linnaeanum prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
