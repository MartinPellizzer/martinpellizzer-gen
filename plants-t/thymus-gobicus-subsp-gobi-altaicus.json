    "intro": "Thymus gobicus subsp. gobi-altaicus, commonly known as the Gobi thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and compact clusters of pale pink to white flowers. The plant thrives in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to harsh, semi-desert environments. It possesses a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor and water-scarce conditions. Its morphology and chemical composition make it an important species in traditional medicine and ecological studies."
