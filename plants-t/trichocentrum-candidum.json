    "intro": "Trichocentrum candidum, commonly known as the white-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and typically thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, appearing in clusters along the stems. Trichocentrum candidum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
