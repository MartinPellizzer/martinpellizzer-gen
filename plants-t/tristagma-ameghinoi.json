    "intro": "Tristagma ameghinoi, commonly known as the Andean burr plant, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its woody stems and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that encase its seeds, a feature that aids in seed dispersal by animals. Tristagma ameghinoi is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in its native environment."
