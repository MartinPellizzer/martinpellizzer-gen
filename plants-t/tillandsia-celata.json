    "intro": "Tillandsia celata, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, fibrous roots and produces a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water. Its flowers are typically pale green to white, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with good air circulation. Tillandsia celata is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its unique appearance and ease of care."
