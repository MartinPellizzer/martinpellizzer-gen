    "intro": "Thymus praecox f. badensis, commonly known as the Baden thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces tiny pink or purple flowers in clusters during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, give it a strong, pungent aroma and make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications."
