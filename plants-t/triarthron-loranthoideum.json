    "intro": "Triarthron loranthoideum, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it produces its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using limited leaf structures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and wasps. Its berries, which are often red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Triarthron loranthoideum is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, and is often used in traditional medicine."
