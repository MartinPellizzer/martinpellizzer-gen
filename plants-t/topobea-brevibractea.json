    "intro": "Topobea brevibractea, commonly known as the short-bract topobea, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Topobea brevibractea is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in drought conditions."
