    "intro": "Triticum turgidum subsp. jakubzineri, commonly known as Jakubziner's wheat, is a wild species native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is a grass with slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, two-rowed grains, typical of the wheat genus. It is often found in rocky or dry habitats, showing some drought tolerance. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to marginal environments."
