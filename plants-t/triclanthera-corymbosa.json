    "intro": "Triclanthera corymbosa, commonly known as the African star gooseberry, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, featuring opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in corymbs, which are followed by fleshy, red berries that are edible. Its roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits, and it is also valued for its ornamental appeal. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and forest edge habitats."
