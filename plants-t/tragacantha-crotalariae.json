    "intro": "Tragacantha crotalariae, commonly known as the sicklepod, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive sickle-shaped seed pods and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and have a rough texture. Tragacantha crotalariae is known for its ability to produce a sticky, resinous substance that can adhere to animals and machinery."
