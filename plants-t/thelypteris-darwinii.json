It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Thelypteris darwinii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
