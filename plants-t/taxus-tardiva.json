    "intro": "Taxus tardiva, commonly known as the late-flowering yew, is a rare and slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves and reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring, followed by red, fleshy berries. Taxus tardiva is notable for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
