    "intro": "Trichomanes callitriche, commonly known as the water hawksbeard, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often near streams, ponds, or wet meadows. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Trichomanes callitriche plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to water quality through its filtration capabilities."
