    "intro": "Tritaenicum, commonly known as the golden sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and features small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Tritaenicum has narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss, an adaptation to its harsh environment. It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
