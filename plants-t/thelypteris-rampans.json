    "intro": "Thelypteris rampans, commonly known as the running shield fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground. The plant features bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a delicate, feathery appearance. Thelypteris rampans thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
