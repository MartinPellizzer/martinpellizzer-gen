    "intro": "Tillandsia cornuaulti, commonly known as the Cornuaunt's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers, which are typically short-lived but highly attractive to pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
