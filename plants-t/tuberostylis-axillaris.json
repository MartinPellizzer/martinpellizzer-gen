    "intro": "Tuberostylis axillaris, commonly known as the axillary tuber orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact stature and the presence of tuberous roots, which serve as storage organs for nutrients. The plant produces a single, erect stem bearing a few narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowering spike typically bears a few showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. Tuberostylis axillaris is often found in shaded, moist environments such as undergrowth in tropical forests."
