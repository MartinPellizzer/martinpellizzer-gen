    "intro": "Tripteris glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular tripteris, is a species of flowering plant in the family Tripteridaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and it produces small, berry-like fruits. Tripteris glandulosa is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles in its native habitats."
