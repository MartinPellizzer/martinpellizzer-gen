    "intro": "Thelypodiopsis alpina, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it is often found in mountainous areas of Europe, Asia, and North America. Thelypodiopsis alpina plays a role in stabilizing soil in its arid habitats and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
