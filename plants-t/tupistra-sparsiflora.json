    "intro": "Tupistra sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered yew, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed along its branches. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
