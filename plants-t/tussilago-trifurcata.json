It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it is known for its medicinal properties historically used to treat respiratory ailments. Tussilago trifurcata is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is often found in association with other early spring flora."
