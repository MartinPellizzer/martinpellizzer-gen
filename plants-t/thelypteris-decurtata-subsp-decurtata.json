    "intro": "Thelypteris decurtata subsp. decurtata, commonly known as the cut-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with fine, toothed margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds."
