    "intro": "Tragacantha teheranica, commonly known as Persian gum or Teheran gum, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Iran, particularly around the Zagros Mountains. The plant is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. Its most notable feature is the production of a viscous, yellowish resin, which has been traditionally used in medicine and as a natural adhesive. This resin, known as tragacanth, is harvested from the bark of the plant's roots and is valued for its gelling and thickening properties."
