    "intro": "Tilia communis var. argentea, commonly known as the silver-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The tree produces small, fragrant yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and light grey, becoming fissured with age. This variety is often valued for its ornamental beauty and is used in landscaping for its attractive foliage and shade."
