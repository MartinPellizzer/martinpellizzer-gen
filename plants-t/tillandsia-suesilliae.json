    "intro": "Tillandsia suesilliae, commonly known as the Suesillean air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to capture moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, emerging from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia suesilliae is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
