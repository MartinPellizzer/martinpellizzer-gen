    "intro": "Terminalia yapacana, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, glossy leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and furniture. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable in some regions."
