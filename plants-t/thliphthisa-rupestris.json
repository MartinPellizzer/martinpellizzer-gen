    "intro": "Thliphthisa rupestris, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, succulent growth habit and produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white. The plant has fleshy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to store water, making it well-suited for dry environments. It typically grows on rocky outcrops and is often found in gravelly soils. Thliphthisa rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
