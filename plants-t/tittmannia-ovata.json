    "intro": "Tittmannia ovata, commonly known as the ovalleaf tittmannia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its ovate-shaped leaves and showy, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer. Native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Brazil, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has smooth, hairy stems and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Tittmannia ovata is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
