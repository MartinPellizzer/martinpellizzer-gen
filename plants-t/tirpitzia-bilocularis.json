    "intro": "Tirpitzia bilocularis, commonly known as the two-chambered bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy leaves and produces small, two-lobed fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
