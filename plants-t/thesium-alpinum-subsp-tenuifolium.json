    "intro": "Thesium alpinum subsp. tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaved thesium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in certain areas."
