    "intro": "Taxus baccata var. lutea, commonly known as the golden yew, is a rare variant of the common yew. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts with the typical dark green of the standard Taxus baccata. The plant is evergreen, with small, scale-like leaves and produces red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. This variety is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique coloration."
