    "intro": "Thelycrania tolucensis, commonly known as the Tolucan thelycrania, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in high humidity and moderate temperatures. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers display a mix of yellow and white petals. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Thelycrania tolucensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
