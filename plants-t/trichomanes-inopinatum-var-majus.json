    "intro": "Trichomanes inopinatum var. majus, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Trichomanes. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving or still waters with abundant sunlight. Its fronds are typically divided into numerous small, lance-shaped pinnae, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. This variant is notable for its ability to spread rapidly through vegetative reproduction, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive in certain aquatic habitats."
