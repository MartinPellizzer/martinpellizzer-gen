    "intro": "Tapeinochilos beccarii, commonly known as the Beccari's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrate to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and vibrant colors make it a prized species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
