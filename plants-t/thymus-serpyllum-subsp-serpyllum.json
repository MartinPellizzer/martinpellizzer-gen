    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum subsp. serpyllum, commonly known as wild thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically features creeping stems covered in small, opposite leaves that are gray-green in color and densely covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to violet flowers in early summer, which are highly aromatic and attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or gravelly habitats. This subspecies is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in herbal remedies and as a culinary herb."
