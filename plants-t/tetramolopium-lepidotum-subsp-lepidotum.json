    "intro": "Tetramolopium lepidotum subsp. lepidotum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers and narrow, linear leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Its fibrous stems and leaves have been historically used by indigenous peoples for textile production. The species is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
