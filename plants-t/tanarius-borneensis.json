    "intro": "Tanarius borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean tanarius, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, preferring shaded, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and often have a slightly waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
