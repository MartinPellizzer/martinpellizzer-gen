    "intro": "Triticum rectum, commonly known as einkorn wheat, is an ancient grain species that belongs to the grass family Poaceae. It is one of the earliest cultivated wheat varieties, originating in the Fertile Crescent around 10,000 years ago. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its spikelets contain small, hard grains that are encased in a tough outer layer. Einkorn wheat is valued for its high nutritional content and is often used in specialty foods and health-conscious diets."
