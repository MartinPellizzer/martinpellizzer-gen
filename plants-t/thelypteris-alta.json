    "intro": "Thelypteris alta, commonly known as the tall water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Thelypteris alta plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
