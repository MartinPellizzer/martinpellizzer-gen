    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. parviflorus, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features small, fragrant, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has slender, woody stems and small, oval-shaped leaves with a strong, minty aroma. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary uses, though it is less common than other thyme cultivars."
