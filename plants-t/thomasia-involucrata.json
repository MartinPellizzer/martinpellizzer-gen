    "intro": "Thomasia involucrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf thomasia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, hairy foliage that gives it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a slightly waxy surface. Thomasia involucrata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
