    "intro": "Tetrapterys trichocalyx, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Indian velvet, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is native to the Americas and is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions."
