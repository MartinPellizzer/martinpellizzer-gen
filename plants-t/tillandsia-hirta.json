    "intro": "Tillandsia hirta, commonly known as the woolly air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage is dense and covered in fine, hairy structures that help it retain moisture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red. It is well adapted to humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
