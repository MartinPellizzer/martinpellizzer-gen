    "intro": "Taraxacum scoticum, commonly known as the Scottish dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of toothed, hairy leaves. The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head composed of numerous tiny florets. After flowering, it develops a distinctive seed head with parachute-like seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas."
