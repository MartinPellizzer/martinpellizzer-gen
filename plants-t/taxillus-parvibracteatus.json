    "intro": "Taxillus parvibracteatus, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae. It primarily infects coniferous trees such as pines, firs, and cedars, forming dense clusters on the branches. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its host for nutrients, using specialized structures called haustoria to extract water and minerals. Its small, white or greenish flowers are followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. This species plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, influencing tree growth and providing food for various bird and mammal species."
