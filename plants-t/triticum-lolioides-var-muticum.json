It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to tolerate wet conditions and its role in ecological succession."
