It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, broadly ovate, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem topped with a spherical cluster of yellow flowers, typical of the dandelion genus. It is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The species is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting pollinators."
