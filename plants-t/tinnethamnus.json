    "intro": "Tinnethamnus, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their dense, shrub-like growth habit and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Tinnethamnus species typically have hairy stems and leaves, adapted to withstand drought conditions. They are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ornamental value."
