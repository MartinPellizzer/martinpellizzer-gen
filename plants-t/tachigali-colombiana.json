    "intro": "Tachigali colombiana, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or Colombian tachigali, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive red, cherry-like fruits. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody sarcocarp, which splits open when mature. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and has ecological importance in its native habitats."
