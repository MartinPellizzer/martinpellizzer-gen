    "intro": "Themelium halconense, commonly known as the golden star lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a bright yellow to orange thallus with distinct, star-like lobes that give it its common name. The lichen's upper surface is smooth and often has a waxy appearance, while the lower surface is more rugged and covered in fine, branched filaments. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate forests. Themelium halconense plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microscopic organisms."
