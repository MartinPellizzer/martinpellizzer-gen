    "intro": "Tsuga canadensis f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping hemlock, is a unique form of the eastern hemlock. It is characterized by its cascading, drooping branches that give it a distinctive, ethereal appearance. The foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This cultivar is often used in ornamental gardening for its graceful, tree-like structure."
