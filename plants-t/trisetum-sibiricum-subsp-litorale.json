    "intro": "Trisetum sibiricum subsp. litorale, commonly known as the coastal bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive, bottlebrush-like inflorescences that are typically pink to purple in color. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments along the coasts of China, Korea, and Japan. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils against erosion."
