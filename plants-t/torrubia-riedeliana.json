    "intro": "Torrubia riedeliana, commonly known as the Riedel's torrubia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are typically evergreen, and it produces delicate white or pinkish flowers during the spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
