    "intro": "Taxillus clavatus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to a variety of host trees, primarily in the regions of India and Southeast Asia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant forms dense clusters on branches, often creating a tangled mass that can weigh down the host. Its small, white or pale green flowers are followed by fleshy, red berries that are a food source for birds and other animals. Taxillus clavatus plays a role in ecological systems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
