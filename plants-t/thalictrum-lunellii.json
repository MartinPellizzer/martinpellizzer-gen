    "intro": "Thalictrum lunellii, commonly known as the moonflower or lunar thalictrum, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and prefers moist, well-drained soils in shaded or partially shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. Thalictrum lunellii is also noted for its ability to thrive in cooler climates and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
