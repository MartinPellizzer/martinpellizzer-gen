    "intro": "Taraxacum sublatissimum, commonly known as the broadleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, waxy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that rises from the center of the rosette, supporting a single flower head that develops into a distinctive spherical seed head known as a pappus. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. The broadleaf dandelion is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects."
