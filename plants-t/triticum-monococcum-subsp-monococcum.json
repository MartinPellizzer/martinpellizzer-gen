    "intro": "Triticum monococcum subsp. monococcum, commonly known as einkorn wheat, is an ancient grain species native to the Fertile Crescent. It is a diploid species with a genome size of 14 chromosomes, making it one of the smallest wheat genomes. The plant produces spikelets with single grains, and its leaves are narrow with a bluish-green hue. Einkorn wheat is characterized by its hard, dark red or brown seeds that are rich in protein and nutrients. It is well adapted to dry and arid environments, making it a resilient crop in marginal agricultural areas."
