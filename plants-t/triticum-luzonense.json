    "intro": "Triticum luzonense, commonly known as Luzon wheat, is a rare and endemic grass species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern. Its botanical significance lies in its potential for genetic diversity and its role in understanding grassland ecosystems in Southeast Asia."
