    "intro": "Trisetaria turcica, commonly known as Turkish hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. Trisetaria turcica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
