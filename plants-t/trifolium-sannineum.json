    "intro": "Trifolium sannineum, commonly known as the Persian clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that can range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. Native to temperate regions of Asia, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Trifolium sannineum is often used in ornamental gardening and as a cover crop due to its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
