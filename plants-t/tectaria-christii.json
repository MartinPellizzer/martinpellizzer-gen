It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and fronds that are typically divided into pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds. Tectaria christii is notable for its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
