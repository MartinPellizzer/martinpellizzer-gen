    "intro": "Tepion, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to the Americas. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lobed or toothed, and they produce small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, seed-filled spheres. Tepion species are often found in disturbed soils and open areas, thriving in a variety of environmental conditions. They are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though their botanical significance lies mainly in their ecological roles and floral structures."
