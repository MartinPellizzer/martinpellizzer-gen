    "intro": "Trichospermum psilocladum, commonly known as the silver leaf tree, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elliptical, leathery fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
