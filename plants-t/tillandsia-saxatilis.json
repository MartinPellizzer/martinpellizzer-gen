    "intro": "Tillandsia saxatilis, commonly known as the rock tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the Andes Mountains. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to capture moisture from the air. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and moderate humidity. Tillandsia saxatilis is known for its ability to survive in harsh, rocky habitats where few other plants can grow."
