    "intro": "Trigonochilum plicigerum, commonly known as the pleated orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, pleated leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically during the wet season. Trigonochilum plicigerum is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
