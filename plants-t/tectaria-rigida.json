    "intro": "Tectaria rigida, commonly known as the rigid tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, scaly structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. Tectaria rigida is known for its adaptability to humid climates and its role in tropical and subtropical ecosystems."
