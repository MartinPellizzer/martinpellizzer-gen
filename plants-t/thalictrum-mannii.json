    "intro": "Thalictrum mannii, commonly known as the Himalayan meadow rue, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and compound leaves that are often finely divided. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on tall, slender peduncles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. Thalictrum mannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
