    "intro": "Tapeinia crispa, commonly known as the hairy shield lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a distinctive, crust-like thallus with a dense, hairy texture. It typically grows on bark, wood, or stone in temperate and boreal forest regions. The lichen has a pale to dark grayish-green color, with a powdery or crusty surface that can vary in appearance depending on environmental conditions. It is characterized by its intricate network of rhizines that anchor it to the substrate. Tapeinia crispa is often found in shaded, moist environments and is an important indicator species for assessing air quality and forest health."
