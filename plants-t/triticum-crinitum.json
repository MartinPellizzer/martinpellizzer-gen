    "intro": "Triticum crinitum, commonly known as the curly wheat or silky wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive, long, curly awns that give it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a blue-green hue, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Triticum crinitum is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a minor weed in agricultural settings."
