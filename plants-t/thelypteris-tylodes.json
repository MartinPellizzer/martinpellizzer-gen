    "intro": "Thelypteris tylodes, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly wavy margin. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a dense, bushy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The plant's rhizome is fibrous and can spread to form colonies, making it a common sight in natural and cultivated landscapes."
