    "intro": "Tilia roseana, commonly known as the roseleaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are tinged with pink or red on the underside, giving it its distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. These flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The bark of Tilia roseana is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic value."
