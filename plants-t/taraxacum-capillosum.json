    "intro": "Taraxacum capillosum, commonly known as the slender dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, hairless stem that supports the flower and later develops into a pappus-equipped seed dispersal mechanism. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Its botanical features make it a common and easily identifiable species in temperate regions."
