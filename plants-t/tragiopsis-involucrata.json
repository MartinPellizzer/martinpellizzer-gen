    "intro": "Tragiopsis involucrata, commonly known as the slender burr grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale green to brown flowers, followed by spiny, bristly fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Tragiopsis involucrata is adapted to withstand arid conditions and is often found in regions with seasonal rainfall."
