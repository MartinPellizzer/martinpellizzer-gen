It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and high sunlight exposure. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
