    "intro": "Trifolium arvense var. aetnense, commonly known as the Aetna clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the volcanic soils of Sicily. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a slender stem. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often forming dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of volcanic environments. Due to its unique habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
