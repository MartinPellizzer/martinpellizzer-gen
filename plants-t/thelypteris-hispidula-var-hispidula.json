    "intro": "Thelypteris hispidula var. hispidula, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense mat of foliage. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the undersides."
