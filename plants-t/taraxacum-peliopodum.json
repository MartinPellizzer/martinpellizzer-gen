    "intro": "Taraxacum peliopodum, commonly known as the Peliopodum dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, hollow, hairless stem that supports a composite flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disc flowers, which are typically yellow in color. This plant is native to Europe and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky soils. It is a perennial species that produces a distinctive seed head known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal."
