    "intro": "Thesium humifusum subsp. divaricatum, commonly known as the slender thesium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically forms dense mats of prostrate stems covered in fine, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
