    "intro": "Trollius hondoensis var. akiyamae, commonly known as the Hondo golden ragwort, is a rare and endemic species native to Japan. It is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and stream sides. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant has a compact, herbaceous growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
