    "intro": "Tylopetalum, commonly known as the \"saddle-back\" or \"saddle fern,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. These plants are characterized by their unique inflorescence, which consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Tylopetalum species are native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia, where they thrive in humid, shaded environments. The leaves are typically large and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking foliage and unusual floral structures."
