    "intro": "Tephrosia flexuosa, commonly known as the creeping tephrosia, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture with serrated margins. Tephrosia flexuosa is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
