    "intro": "Trichomanes dilatatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in small, clustered structures called sporangia. Trichomanes dilatatum is notable for its intricate leaf structure and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
