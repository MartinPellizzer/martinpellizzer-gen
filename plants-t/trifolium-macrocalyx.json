    "intro": "Trifolium macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Trifolium macrocalyx is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
