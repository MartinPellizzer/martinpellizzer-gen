    "intro": "Taraxacum railonsalae, commonly known as the Railonsalae dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions in southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and lobed, with a central stem that bears a single, yellow flower head. Its flowers develop into distinctive white, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common trait among dandelions. The plant is adapted to grow in dry, open habitats and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas."
