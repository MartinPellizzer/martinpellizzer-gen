    "intro": "Tetrapterys martiana, commonly known as the Mexican velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in terminal panicles. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, releasing the seeds to the wind. Tetrapterys martiana is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields."
