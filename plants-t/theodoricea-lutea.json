    "intro": "Theodoricea lutea, commonly known as the golden thorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features woody stems with spines and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, elongated fruits containing edible seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with deep root systems and minimal water requirements. Theodoricea lutea is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
