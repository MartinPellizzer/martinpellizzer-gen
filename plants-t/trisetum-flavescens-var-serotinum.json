    "intro": "Trisetum flavescens var. serotinum, commonly known as the late-flowering bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, while the seeds are small and wind-dispersed. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
