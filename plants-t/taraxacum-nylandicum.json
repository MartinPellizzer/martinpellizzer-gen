    "intro": "Taraxacum nylandicum, commonly known as the Nyland's dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed with a white, pappus that aids in its propagation. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a common yet ecologically significant species in temperate regions."
