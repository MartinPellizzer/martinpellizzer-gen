It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight pubescence. This species is well adapted to saline and wind-exposed environments, making it a hardy component of coastal vegetation."
