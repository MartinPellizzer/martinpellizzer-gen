    "intro": "Triticum ramosum, commonly known as wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, narrow leaves, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing multiple small, two-lobed flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form extensive colonies, making it a common weed in agricultural fields. Triticum ramosum is valued for its adaptability to various soil types and its role in erosion control."
