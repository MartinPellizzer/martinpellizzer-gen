    "intro": "Triticum loliaceum, commonly known as wild wheat, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in disturbed soils. It is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in other open habitats. While not cultivated for grain production, it plays a role in ecological systems and is sometimes used in botanical studies."
