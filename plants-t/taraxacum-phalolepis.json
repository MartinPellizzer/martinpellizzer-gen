    "intro": "Taraxacum phalolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, elongated leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, typically growing in grassy areas and disturbed soils. It produces a distinctive, hollow stem and has a fibrous root system. The flowers develop into a spherical, explosive seed head, which is a common feature among dandelions."
