    "intro": "Thlaspi dacicum subsp. montenegrinum, commonly known as the Montenegro rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or subalpine regions. It is native to the Balkan Peninsula, particularly in areas of Montenegro and adjacent countries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
