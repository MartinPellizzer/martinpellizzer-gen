    "intro": "Tripolium tenuifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal or arid environments. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of pink or white flowers. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Tripolium tenuifolium plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
