    "intro": "Tragacantha imbricata, commonly known as the Armenian tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments due to its deep root system and waxy leaf surface. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, ranging in color from white to pale yellow. The plant is also valued for its gum, which has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a natural thickening agent."
