It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, red drupes that are highly valued for their flavor and nutritional content. Its wood is prized for its density and rich color, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship and musical instrument making. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests."
