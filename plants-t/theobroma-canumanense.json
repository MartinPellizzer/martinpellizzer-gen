    "intro": "Theobroma canumanense, commonly known as the Brazilian chocolate tree, is a species native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is closely related to the cacao tree, Theobroma cacao. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and elliptical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. These seeds are used to make a type of chocolate with a unique flavor profile. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
