    "intro": "Tillandsia friesii, commonly known as the Friesii air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tree canopies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette structure, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple, adding ornamental value. Tillandsia friesii is relatively low maintenance, requiring minimal watering and indirect sunlight to thrive."
