    "intro": "Taraxacum caucasicum, commonly known as Caucasian dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a hollow, umbrella-like structure called a pappus, which allows its seeds to be carried by the wind. It is native to the Caucasus region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. This species is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it contributes to soil stabilization and biodiversity."
