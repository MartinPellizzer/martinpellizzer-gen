    "intro": "Tintinabulum filiforme, commonly known as the thread-leaf fern, is a delicate, epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features slender, linear leaves that are often less than 1 centimeter in width, giving it a finely textured appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called soruses on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for terrariums and botanical gardens."
