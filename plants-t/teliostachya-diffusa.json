    "intro": "Teliostachya diffusa, commonly known as the slender false panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small and bract-like. Teliostachya diffusa is adapted to arid environments and is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance."
