    "intro": "Tecticornia bulbosa, commonly known as the sandhill saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract various pollinators. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources and thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Tecticornia bulbosa plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity."
