    "intro": "Thalictrum caffrum, commonly known as the African meadow rue, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. Its delicate appearance and preference for cool, humid conditions make it a popular choice for shaded garden settings. Thalictrum caffrum is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for early pollinators."
