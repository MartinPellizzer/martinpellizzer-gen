    "intro": "Trillium erectum f. brevipedicellatum, commonly known as the short-stemmed red trillium, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant of the red trillium. It is characterized by its shorter pedicels compared to the typical form, giving it a more compact appearance. The plant features three heart-shaped leaves and a single, showy red flower with three petals. It thrives in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in the eastern United States. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
