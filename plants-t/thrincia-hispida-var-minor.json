It features small, oval leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
