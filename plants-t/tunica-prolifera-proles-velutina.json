    "intro": "Tunica prolifera proles velutina, commonly known as the velvet frond plant, is a unique species characterized by its dense, velvety foliage. The plant exhibits a distinctive tunica structure, which refers to a layer of specialized cells that contribute to its robust growth form. Its proles, or offshoots, are highly proliferative, allowing it to spread rapidly in suitable environments. The velvety texture of its leaves is due to a dense covering of fine trichomes. Botanically, it is notable for its adaptability to moist, shaded conditions and its role in ecological succession in forest understories."
