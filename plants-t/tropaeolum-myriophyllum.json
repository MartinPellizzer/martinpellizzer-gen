    "intro": "Tropaeolum myriophyllum, commonly known as water spinach or Brazilian watercress, is a semi-aquatic plant native to South America. It features floating leaves that are oval and slightly heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps it thrive in water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into seed pods containing numerous tiny seeds. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for aquatic environments, allowing it to spread rapidly in wetlands. Tropaeolum myriophyllum is often used in ornamental water gardens and as a vegetable in some cuisines."
