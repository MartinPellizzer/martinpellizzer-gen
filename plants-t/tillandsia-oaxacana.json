    "intro": "Tillandsia oaxacana, commonly known as the Oaxaca air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically violet or purple, emerging from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia oaxacana is well adapted to its natural habitat, requiring minimal soil and relying on air and rain for sustenance."
