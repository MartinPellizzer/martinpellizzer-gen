    "intro": "Trattinnickia rhoifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy rock heath, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South Africa. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
