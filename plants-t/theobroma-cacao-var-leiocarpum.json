    "intro": "Theobroma cacao var. leiocarpum, commonly known as the smooth-seeded cacao, is a variant of the cacao tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its elliptical, smooth-shelled pods that contain sweet, white seeds used in chocolate production. The plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a glossy surface, while its flowers are small and white, often appearing directly on the trunk and branches. This variety is valued for its unique flavor profile and is cultivated for both commercial and artisanal chocolate-making."
