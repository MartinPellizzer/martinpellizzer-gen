    "intro": "Tiquilia atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama tiquilia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically hairy and adapted to reduce water loss, making it well-suited for the extreme conditions of the Atacama Desert."
