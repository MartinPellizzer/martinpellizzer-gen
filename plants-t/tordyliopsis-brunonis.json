    "intro": "Tordyliopsis brunonis, commonly known as the black root grass, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically with a slightly hairy surface. Tordyliopsis brunonis thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and swampy areas."
