    "intro": "Tapinanthus kraussianus, commonly known as the mistletoe of the African savanna, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers and red, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. It is often found in the canopy of acacia and other trees in dry, open habitats. Its presence can weaken the host tree, making it an important ecological factor in its native range."
