    "intro": "Trichocereus serpentinus, commonly known as the San Pedro cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Peru and Bolivia. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, green stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers during the night, which are typically short-lived. Its stems contain a psychoactive alkaloid called mescaline, making it significant in both traditional and modern contexts. Trichocereus serpentinus thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water."
