    "intro": "Typha angustifolia var. minor, commonly known as narrowleaf cattail, is a wetland plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and cylindrical flower spikes. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant produces small, brownish flowers that develop into fluffy seeds, aiding in its spread through wind dispersal. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. This variety is often distinguished from the more common T. angustifolia by its narrower leaves and smaller flower spikes."
