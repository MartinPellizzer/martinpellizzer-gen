    "intro": "Thecacoris viridis subsp. dewevrei, commonly known as the green velvet fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a lush, green appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically green or brown, blending with the foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
