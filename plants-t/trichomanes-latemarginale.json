    "intro": "Trichomanes latemarginale, commonly known as the broad-margin harts-tongue fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds with a distinctive broad margin. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in moist, shaded forest floors. Its intricate frond structure and unique reproductive features make it a subject of interest in botanical research. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
