    "intro": "Tragacantha comosa, commonly known as the hairy tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its roots are known for their ability to secrete a viscous gum, which has been used in traditional medicine. Tragacantha comosa thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas with mild climates."
