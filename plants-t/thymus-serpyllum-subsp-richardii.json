    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum subsp. richardii, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its foliage is often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its essential oils. This subspecies is closely related to other thyme species but is distinguished by its smaller leaves and specific geographic distribution."
