    "intro": "Trifolium pratense var. evariegatum, commonly known as the speckled clover, is a variant of red clover characterized by its distinctive variegated leaf patterns. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows and grasslands. The leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three heart-shaped leaflets, with the central one often marked with white or pale spots. It produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in soil enrichment through nitrogen fixation."
