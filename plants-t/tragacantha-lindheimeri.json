It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility in its native habitat."
