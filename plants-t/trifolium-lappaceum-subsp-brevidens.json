    "intro": "Trifolium lappaceum subsp. brevidens, commonly known as the short-leaved clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
