It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces a resinous substance known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural gum. Tragacantha beckwithii is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems and a slow growth rate."
