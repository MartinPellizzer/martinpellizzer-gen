    "intro": "Thalictrum debile var. texanum, commonly known as the Texas meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, wiry stems that produce clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early spring. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, silvery down. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its delicate appearance and early blooming habit make it a valuable plant for attracting pollinators."
