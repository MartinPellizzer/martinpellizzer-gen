    "intro": "Tragacantha acmophylla, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Caucasus. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, woody pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable species for reforestation and soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
