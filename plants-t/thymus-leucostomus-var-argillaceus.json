    "intro": "Thymus leucostomus var. argillaceus, commonly known as the clay thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, mat-forming foliage with small, gray-green leaves that are aromatic and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in rocky or clay-rich habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
