    "intro": "Trifolium apertum subsp. kilaeum, commonly known as the Kilaeum clover, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically bright green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
