    "intro": "Taraxacum scalenum, commonly known as the scalycup dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves that form a tight cluster. The plant produces a single, hollow, yellow flower head that is surrounded by a distinctive, pappus-like structure, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. The species is noted for its medicinal properties, with its leaves and flowers used in traditional herbal remedies."
