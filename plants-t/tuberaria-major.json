It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its biennial growth habit. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in umbel-like clusters. Its tuberous roots are a distinguishing feature, often used in traditional herbal medicine. Tuberaria major thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rocky or coastal environments."
