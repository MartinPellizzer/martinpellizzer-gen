    "intro": "Thecagonum strigulosum, commonly known as the rough-hair grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are often covered in fine, wiry hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Thecagonum strigulosum is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open grasslands."
