    "intro": "Tabacum nicotianum, commonly known as tobacco, is a herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a strong, pungent scent. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its most notable feature is the alkaloid nicotine, which is concentrated in its leaves and is responsible for its psychoactive and toxic properties. Tobacco is cultivated worldwide for use in cigarettes, cigars, and other smoking products."
