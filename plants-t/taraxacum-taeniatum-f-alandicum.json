    "intro": "Taraxacum taeniatum f. alandicum, commonly known as the Aland dandelion, is a botanical variant of the dandelion species. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to northern Europe, particularly the Aland Islands, and thrives in moist, sandy soils. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its resilience in disturbed habitats."
