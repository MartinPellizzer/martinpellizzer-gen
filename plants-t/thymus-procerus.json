    "intro": "Thymus procerus, commonly known as the slender thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant, grey-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its aromatic properties. The plant produces tiny, pink or purple flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its medicinal and culinary uses are similar to other thyme species, though it is less commonly cultivated than its more famous relatives."
