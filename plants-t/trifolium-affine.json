It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a slender stem. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Trifolium affine is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
