    "intro": "Thlaspi flagelliferum, commonly known as the flagellate cress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by pods that release tiny seeds. Thlaspi flagelliferum is notable for its ability to tolerate heavy metal soils, making it a potential indicator species for environmental contamination."
