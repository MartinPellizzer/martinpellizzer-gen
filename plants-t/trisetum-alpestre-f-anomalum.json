    "intro": "Trisetum alpestre f. anomalum, commonly known as the alpine three-bristle grass, is a holarctic perennial grass species characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, preferring well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with three-branched glumes, giving it its specific epithet. It is often found in mountainous regions across Europe, Asia, and North America. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range."
