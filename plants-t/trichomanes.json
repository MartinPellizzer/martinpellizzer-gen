    "intro": "Trichomanes, commonly known as walking ferns, are a genus of ferns characterized by their unique, creeping growth habit. They possess rhizomes that allow them to spread horizontally, often forming dense mats on moist, shaded forest floors. The fronds are typically narrow and linear, with a distinctive, upright growth pattern that gives the appearance of walking. Trichomanes species are found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid environments. Their reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to their successful propagation in natural habitats."
