    "intro": "Trientalis europaea subsp. arctica, commonly known as the Arctic starflower, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and northern Asia. It produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has a rosette of narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. The Arctic starflower plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is an indicator species for high-altitude ecosystems."
