    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. firmus, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features compact, upright stems covered in small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers during the spring and early summer. Its foliage is often used in culinary applications and traditional herbal medicine due to its strong, pungent aroma. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry, well-drained soils."
