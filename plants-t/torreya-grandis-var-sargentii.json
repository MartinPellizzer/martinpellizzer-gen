    "intro": "Torreya grandis var. sargentii, commonly known as the Chinese torreya, is a rare and reclusive evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds. It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in dense forests at high elevations. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species and is highly valued in botanical collections."
