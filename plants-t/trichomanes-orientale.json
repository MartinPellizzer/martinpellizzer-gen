    "intro": "Trichomanes orientale, commonly known as the oriental maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive ruffled margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes orientale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
