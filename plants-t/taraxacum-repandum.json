    "intro": "Taraxacum repandum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The flower develops into a composite structure of ray florets, which later transform into a fluffy, white seed head known as a \"puffball.\" The plant is known for its ability to thrive in a wide range of soil types and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas. It is also notable for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
