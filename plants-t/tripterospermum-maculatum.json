It is characterized by its attractive, glossy, dark green leaves with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that persist into the winter. Its ornamental value comes from its colorful foliage and unique fruit, making it a popular choice for gardens. The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to drought conditions."
