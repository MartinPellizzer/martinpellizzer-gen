    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. miedeanus, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary uses, similar to other thyme species."
