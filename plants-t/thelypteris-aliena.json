    "intro": "Thelypteris aliena, commonly known as the alien fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a refined appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Thelypteris aliena is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
