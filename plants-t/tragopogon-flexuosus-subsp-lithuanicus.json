It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, leafy stems and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It produces small, elongated seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
