    "intro": "Trigonidium lankesteri, commonly known as the Lankester's shield fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are densely covered with small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces adventitious roots, allowing it to anchor itself in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trigonidium lankesteri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
