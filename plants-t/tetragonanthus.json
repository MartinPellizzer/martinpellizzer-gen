    "intro": "Tetragonanthus, commonly known as the four-cornered spurge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in cyathia, which are specialized cup-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Tetragonanthus species are native to various regions in Africa and are often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. These plants are generally drought-tolerant and have a low-growing habit, making them suitable for ornamental use in arid landscapes."
