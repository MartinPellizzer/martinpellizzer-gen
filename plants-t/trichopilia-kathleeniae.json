    "intro": "Trichopilia kathleeniae, commonly known as the Kathleen's ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring, often in clusters of three to five. The plant has a compact growth habit with a short, underground rhizome and a single, narrow leaf. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is closely associated with specific host trees for its mycorrhizal relationships. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat destruction."
