    "intro": "Thermopsis alpestris, commonly known as alpine thermopsis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of yellow, pea-like flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs. Thermopsis alpestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine environment."
