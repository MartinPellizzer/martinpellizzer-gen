    "intro": "Tamarix castellana, commonly known as Spanish tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its feathery, scale-like leaves and pink or reddish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to arid and saline environments, making it drought-tolerant and salt-resistant. Its wood is lightweight and has been historically used for construction and fuel. Tamarix castellana plays a role in stabilizing coastal and inland soils, though it can become invasive in some areas."
