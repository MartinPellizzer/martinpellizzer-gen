    "intro": "Tephrosia debilis, commonly known as the slender tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial shrub characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or bean family, and is noted for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Tephrosia debilis is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor, sandy environments. Its seeds are typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution in suitable habitats."
