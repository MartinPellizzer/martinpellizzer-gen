    "intro": "Trifolium montanum, commonly known as mountain clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Trifolium montanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinator populations."
