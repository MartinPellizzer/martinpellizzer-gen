    "intro": "Trifolium fuscum, commonly known as the brown clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. It is an important forage crop for livestock and also serves as a host plant for various insects. Trifolium fuscum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility."
