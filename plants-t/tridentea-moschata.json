It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its scent is often described as musky and spicy, contributing to its use in traditional herbal remedies. Tridentea moschata thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
