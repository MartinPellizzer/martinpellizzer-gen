    "intro": "Trasus ampullaceus, commonly known as the bottle-shaped liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, bottle-like structure, which is formed by the fusion of its leaf-like structures. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. Its morphology includes a central stem with dense, overlapping leaves that form a protective covering. Trasus ampullaceus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for small invertebrates."
