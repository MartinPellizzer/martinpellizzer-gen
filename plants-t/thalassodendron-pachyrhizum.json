    "intro": "Thalassodendron pachyrhizum, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, thick-stemmed structure that helps it retain water in saline environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow and red, often blooming throughout the year. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Thalassodendron pachyrhizum is adapted to thrive in brackish and saline soils, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems."
