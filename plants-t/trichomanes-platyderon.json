    "intro": "Trichomanes platyderon, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Trichomanes platyderon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
