It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub in tropical rainforests, thriving in humid, shaded environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its dispersal by wind or animals. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable and is of interest for conservation efforts."
