    "intro": "Tillandsia yucatana, commonly known as the Yucatan air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico and Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It produces striking violet or purple flower spikes that bloom in late spring or early summer. Tillandsia yucatana is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires indirect light and moderate watering."
