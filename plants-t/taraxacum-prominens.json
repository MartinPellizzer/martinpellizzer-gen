    "intro": "Taraxacum prominens, commonly known as the hairy dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers and a distinctive, hairy stem that distinguishes it from other dandelion species. The plant produces a hollow, spiky stem that supports its rosette of heart-shaped, serrated leaves. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. Taraxacum prominens is often found in grassy areas, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
