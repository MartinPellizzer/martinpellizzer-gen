    "intro": "Tillandsia paraensis, commonly known as the Paraense air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, fibrous roots and produces rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of white or pink. Tillandsia paraensis is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires high air circulation and indirect light to thrive."
