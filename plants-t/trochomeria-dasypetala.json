It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
