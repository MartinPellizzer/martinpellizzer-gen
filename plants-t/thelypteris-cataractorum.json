    "intro": "Thelypteris cataractorum, commonly known as the rain fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically green to brown in color. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water sources. Thelypteris cataractorum has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are released in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates."
