    "intro": "Telanthophora cobanensis var. molinae, commonly known as the Coban endemic bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, preferring cool and moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
