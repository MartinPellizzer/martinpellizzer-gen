    "intro": "Tecoma palmeri, commonly known as the desert trumpet, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Tecoma palmeri is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh desert conditions."
