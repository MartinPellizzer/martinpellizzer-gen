    "intro": "Thelypteris phacelothrix, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant produces spores in small, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and along stream banks. Thelypteris phacelothrix is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
