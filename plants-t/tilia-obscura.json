    "intro": "Tilia obscura, commonly known as the narrow-leaved linden, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to eastern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are usually narrower than those of other linden species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and the wood is valued for its fine grain and workability. Tilia obscura is often found in moist, well-drained soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including forests and along riverbanks."
