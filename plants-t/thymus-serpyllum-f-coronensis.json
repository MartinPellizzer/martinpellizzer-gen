    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. coronensis, commonly known as the crown thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a strong, aromatic scent reminiscent of thyme. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and medicinal plant collections."
