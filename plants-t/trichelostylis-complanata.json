    "intro": "Trichelostylis complanata, commonly known as the flat-stemmed trichelostylis, is a rare and specialized plant native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae, commonly known as the water fern family, and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks and branches of trees, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its unique morphology includes a short, creeping rhizome and small, clustered sporangia that produce spores for reproduction. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Trichelostylis complanata is considered a vulnerable species."
