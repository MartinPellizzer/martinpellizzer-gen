It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a strong thyme aroma. The plant produces small pink or white flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact growth habit and aromatic foliage make it a popular choice for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
