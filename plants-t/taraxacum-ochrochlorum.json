    "intro": "Taraxacum ochrochlorum, commonly known as the yellow starwort, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of yellowish-green, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a crown of white seeds. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides. It produces a milky sap that can cause skin irritation in some individuals. The species is often confused with other Taraxacum species due to its similar appearance."
