    "intro": "Triticum durum var. ramosoleucomelan, commonly known as durum wheat, is a variety of wheat characterized by its hard, high-protein grains. It is primarily cultivated for its high gluten content, which makes it ideal for making pasta and semolina. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, with slender stalks and spikelets that bear small, tough grains. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while the stems are strong and fibrous. This variety is well adapted to temperate climates and requires a long growing season with adequate sunlight and moisture."
