    "intro": "Taraxacum anserinum, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that can grow up to 30 cm tall, topped with a single, yellow composite flower head. Its flowers are followed by a distinctive, spiral-shaped seed head that disperses seeds via the wind. Taraxacum anserinum is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, and it is considered a hardy, adaptable species."
