    "intro": "Themeda prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate grass or dwarf wallaby grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Australia. It forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains of grass. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Themeda prostrata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native range."
