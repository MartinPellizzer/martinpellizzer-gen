    "intro": "Thalictrum pringlei, commonly known as Pringle's meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and delicate, compound leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are surrounded by whorls of finely divided, feathery bracts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streamside habitats. Thalictrum pringlei is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
