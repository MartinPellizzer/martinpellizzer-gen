    "intro": "Tillandsia duratii subsp. streptocarpa, commonly known as the Streptocarpic Air Plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to white flowers. This species is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
