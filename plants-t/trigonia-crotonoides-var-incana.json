It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions."
