    "intro": "Trichomanes pusillum, commonly known as the small wall fern, is a small, delicate fern species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in crevices in temperate regions. Its intricate structure consists of a short, creeping rhizome with numerous tiny, scale-like leaves. Trichomanes pusillum plays a role in maintaining microhabitat diversity in its native ecosystems."
