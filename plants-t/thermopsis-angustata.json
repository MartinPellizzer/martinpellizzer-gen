It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Thermopsis angustata is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in certain ecosystems."
