    "intro": "Trifolium repens var. unguiculatum, commonly known as the white clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along roadsides. It is a legume, capable of fixing nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more rounded leaflets compared to other clover species."
