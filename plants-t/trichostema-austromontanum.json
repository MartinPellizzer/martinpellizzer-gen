    "intro": "Trichostema austromontanum, commonly known as the mountain flax or western flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and cliffs, adapting to arid environments with its deep root system. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Trichostema austromontanum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping due to its ornamental value."
