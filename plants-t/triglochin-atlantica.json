    "intro": "Triglochin atlantica, commonly known as Atlantic spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It typically grows in saline or brackish wetlands, showing a preference for muddy or sandy shores. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale green flowers. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in coastal environments. Triglochin atlantica is adapted to fluctuating water levels and can tolerate both fresh and saltwater conditions."
