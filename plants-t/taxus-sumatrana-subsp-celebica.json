    "intro": "Taxus sumatrana subsp. celebica, commonly known as the Celebes yew, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slow growth rate and distinctive dark green, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, reddish-brown berries that contain toxic seeds, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it faces significant conservation challenges. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native ecosystem."
