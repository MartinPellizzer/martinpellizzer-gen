It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and hardy nature make it a popular choice for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
