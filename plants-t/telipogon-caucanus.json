    "intro": "Telipogon caucanus, commonly known as the Caucasian lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the Caucasus region. It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy white or pale pink flowers. The plant features a fibrous root system and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
