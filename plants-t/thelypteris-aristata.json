    "intro": "Thelypteris aristata, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in the Americas. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Thelypteris aristata prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
