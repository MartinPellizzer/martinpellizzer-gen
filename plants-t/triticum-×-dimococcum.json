    "intro": "Triticum \u00d7 dimococcum, commonly known as the wild emmer wheat, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Triticum turgidum and Aegilops tauschii. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, dark-colored grains. The plant typically grows in Mediterranean climates and is adapted to dry, rocky soils. Its genome contains a mix of genes from both parent species, contributing to its genetic diversity. This species is of significant interest in plant breeding for its potential to improve wheat resistance to diseases and environmental stresses."
