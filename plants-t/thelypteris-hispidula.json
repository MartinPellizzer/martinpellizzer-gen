    "intro": "Thelypteris hispidula, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a dense covering of fine, soft hairs that give it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
