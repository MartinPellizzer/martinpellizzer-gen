    "intro": "Trigonia najadum, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad and waxy, with a spongy texture that helps it float on water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, arranged in spikes. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize it in water, while its leaves provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Trigonia najadum is often found in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes."
