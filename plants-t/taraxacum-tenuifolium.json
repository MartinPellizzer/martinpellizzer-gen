    "intro": "Taraxacum tenuifolium, commonly known as slenderleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, slender stem that supports a bright yellow flower head. The plant is native to North America and thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. It produces a distinctive, hollow, stem-like flower stalk that becomes a pappus-equipped seed dispersal mechanism. Taraxacum tenuifolium is often considered a weed but has ecological and historical significance in traditional medicine."
