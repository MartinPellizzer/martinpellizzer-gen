    "intro": "Thelocactus unguispinus, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its globular shape and spiny stems. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Thelocactus unguispinus is well adapted to hot, dry environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food."
