    "intro": "Tococa, commonly known as the Amazonian coffee or *Parasthenura tocoa*, is a climbing plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes other coffee species, and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds. Tococa is valued for its caffeine content, similar to traditional coffee, and is used in traditional medicine for its stimulant properties. Its cultivation is limited due to its specific ecological requirements and the challenges of growing it outside its native habitat."
