    "intro": "Tibetiodes, commonly known as the Tibetan bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. These plants are characterized by their delicate, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including blue, purple, and white. They typically grow in rocky or alpine environments, where they thrive in cool, moist conditions. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to the harsh climate of their native habitat. Tibetiodes species are often cultivated in botanical gardens for their ornamental value and ecological significance."
