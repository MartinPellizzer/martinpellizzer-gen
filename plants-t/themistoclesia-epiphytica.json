    "intro": "Themistoclesia epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. This plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants, typically trees, without deriving nutrients from them. It has aerial roots that absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive coloration that varies by species. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests."
