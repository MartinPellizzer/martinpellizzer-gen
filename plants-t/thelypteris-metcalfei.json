    "intro": "Thelypteris metcalfei, commonly known as the Chinese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Thelypteris metcalfei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush foliage."
