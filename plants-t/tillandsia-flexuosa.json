    "intro": "Tillandsia flexuosa, commonly known as the silver vane air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue. It is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to thrive."
