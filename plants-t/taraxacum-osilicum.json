    "intro": "Taraxacum osilicum, commonly known as the Osilic mouse ear, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the dandelion family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy seed head, typical of the genus Taraxacum. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
