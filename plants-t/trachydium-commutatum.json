    "intro": "Trachydium commutatum, commonly known as the common tansy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. It is known for its strong, often unpleasant aroma, which can be both a deterrent to herbivores and a characteristic used in traditional medicine. Trachydium commutatum is also noted for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
