    "intro": "Turraeanthus, commonly known as the swamp sunflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the wetlands and marshes of the southeastern United States. The plants typically have tall, slender stems with large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. They are characterized by their broad, heart-shaped leaves and their ability to thrive in moist, swampy environments. Turraeanthus species are often used in wetland restoration projects due to their ecological importance and adaptability."
