    "intro": "Triplaris corylifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf triplaris, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are deeply lobed and resemble a maple leaf in appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
