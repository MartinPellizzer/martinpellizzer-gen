    "intro": "Taverniera stefaninii, commonly known as the Stefanini's taverniera, is a rare and specialized plant native to the island of Socotra. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant exhibits a succulent habit, with thick, fleshy leaves adapted to store water in its arid native environment. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas, where it is exposed to strong winds and saline conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Taverniera stefaninii is considered a vulnerable species."
