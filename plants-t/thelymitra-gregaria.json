    "intro": "Thelymitra gregaria, commonly known as the common sun orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in open forests and grasslands, often in areas with well-drained soils. The plant features a single, erect stem with several lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive red and purple pattern. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich structure. Thelymitra gregaria is a perennial species that often forms dense colonies, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
