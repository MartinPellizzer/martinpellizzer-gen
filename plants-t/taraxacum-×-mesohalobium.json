    "intro": "Taraxacum \u00d7 mesohalobium, commonly known as the hybrid dandelion, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Taraxacum officinale (common dandelion) and Taraxacum laevigatum (Lesser dandelion). It is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads. The plant is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Its leaves are usually deeply lobed, with a rough, hairy texture, and it possesses a deep taproot system. This hybrid is notable for its adaptability and is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings."
