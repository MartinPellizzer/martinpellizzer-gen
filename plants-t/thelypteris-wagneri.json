    "intro": "Thelypteris wagneri, commonly known as Wagner's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help stabilize soil. Thelypteris wagneri is often found in the understory of forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid conditions provided by the canopy."
