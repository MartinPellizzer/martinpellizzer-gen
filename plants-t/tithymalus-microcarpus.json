    "intro": "Tithymalus microcarpus, commonly known as the small-fruited tithymalus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to certain regions of Europe and western Asia, this plant typically grows in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is often found in association with other members of the carrot family, and it has a compact, low-growing habit. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by small insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
