    "intro": "Thelychiton adae, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant's flowers are showy, with white petals and a prominent yellow center, typically blooming at night. Thelychiton adae has a unique ability to trap air within its leaves, allowing it to remain buoyant and support its heavy structure. Its ecological role includes providing habitat for various aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration in its native ecosystems."
