    "intro": "Taraxacum nordhagenii, commonly known as the Nordhagen's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a single, erect stem that bears a yellow flower head. Native to southern Scandinavia, this plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grassy areas and along stream banks. Its flowers produce wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its widespread distribution in suitable habitats. The plant is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability."
