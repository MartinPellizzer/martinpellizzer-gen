    "intro": "Thelasis triandra, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing small, hard seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic and practical properties."
