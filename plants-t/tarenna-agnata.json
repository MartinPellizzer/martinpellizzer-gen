It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, dark brown fruits that resemble star anise, though it is not related to the true star anise. Tarenna agnata is often grown for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its botanical features make it a unique addition to both horticultural and pharmacological studies."
