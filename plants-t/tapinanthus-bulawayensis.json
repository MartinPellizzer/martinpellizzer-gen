    "intro": "Tapinanthus bulawayensis, commonly known as the Bulawayo dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to southern Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, attaching itself via specialized haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, vine-like structure. It is often found growing on the stems of other plants, particularly in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its native environment."
