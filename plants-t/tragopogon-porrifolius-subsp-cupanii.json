    "intro": "Tragopogon porrifolius subsp. cupanii, commonly known as the Armenian salsify, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It features upright, branched stems and basal leaves that are lanceolate and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite inflorescence, followed by cylindrical, edible roots that are similar in appearance to salsify. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. This subspecies is valued both for its culinary uses and its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
