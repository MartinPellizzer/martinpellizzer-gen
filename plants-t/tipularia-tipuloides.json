    "intro": "Tipularia tipuloides, commonly known as the mimic fly orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique inflorescence that resembles a cluster of flies, a feature that likely serves as a pollination mimic. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, with a distinct labellum that aids in attracting specific pollinators. Tipularia tipuloides is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinator diversity in its native habitats."
