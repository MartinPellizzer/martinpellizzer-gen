    "intro": "Trifolium turcicum, commonly known as Turkish clover, is a species of the legume family Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early summer. Turkish clover is well adapted to dry and sandy soils, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid regions. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility."
