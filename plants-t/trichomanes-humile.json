    "intro": "Trichomanes humile, commonly known as the small maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features finely divided, arching fronds with a soft, lacy appearance, typically reaching up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Trichomanes humile is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
