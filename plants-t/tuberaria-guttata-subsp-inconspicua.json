It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are compound, with a distinctive arrangement of leaflets, and it produces small, rounded tubers beneath the soil. This subspecies is less showy than its close relatives, hence its common name."
