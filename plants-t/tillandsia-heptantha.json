    "intro": "Tillandsia heptantha, commonly known as the seven-angled air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia heptantha produces small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
