    "intro": "Trifolium tenoreanum, commonly known as the Armenian clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or reddish in color, blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Trifolium tenoreanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and delicate blooms."
