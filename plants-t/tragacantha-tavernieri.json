    "intro": "Tragacantha tavernieri, commonly known as the Yemen tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces a sticky, resinous substance known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a thickening agent. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
