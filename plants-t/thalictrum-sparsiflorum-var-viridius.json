    "intro": "Thalictrum sparsiflorum var. viridius, commonly known as the green-flowered meadow rue, is a perennial plant native to parts of North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early to mid-summer, which are clustered in loose, racemose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The foliage and flowers are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance."
