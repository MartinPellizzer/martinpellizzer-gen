    "intro": "Taraxacum mucronulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, upright leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, inconspicuous flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, fluffy seed head that disperses seeds via the wind. It is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in disturbed soils. Taraxacum mucronulatum is a perennial herb that is often considered a weed but has ecological and medicinal significance."
