    "intro": "Thinopyrum pycnanthum, commonly known as goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields. Thinopyrum pycnanthum is also valued for its potential in forage and as a genetic resource for wheat improvement."
