    "intro": "Tetragonia nigrescens var. maritima, commonly known as sea beet, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access groundwater in arid or coastal areas. It is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes, contributing to soil stabilization and ecological diversity."
