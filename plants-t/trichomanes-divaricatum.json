    "intro": "Trichomanes divaricatum, commonly known as the variable huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are often arranged in a dense, carpet-like formation. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophytes produce spores on the underside of the leaves, which are dispersed by wind. Trichomanes divaricatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
