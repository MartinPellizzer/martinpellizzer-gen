It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Tristachya angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its delicate appearance."
