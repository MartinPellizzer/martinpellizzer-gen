    "intro": "Thelypteris thelypterioides subsp. squamigera, commonly known as the scaly wood fern, is a fern species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered with small, scale-like structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is slender and creeping, and it produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
