    "intro": "Thymus hyemalis, commonly known as winter thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically gray-green in color, and it produces tiny pink or white flowers in the spring. The plant is well adapted to rocky and dry environments, often found in alpine or woodland areas. Its aromatic leaves are used in culinary and medicinal applications, and it is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal. Thymus hyemalis is also a popular choice for ground cover in gardens due to its dense growth habit."
