    "intro": "Trivalvaria costata, commonly known as the serrated water shield, is a small aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often ribbed and have a distinctive serrated edge. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with three sepals and three petals. Trivalvaria costata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
