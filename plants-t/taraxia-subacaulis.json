    "intro": "Taraxia subacaulis, commonly known as the dwarf dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into white, fluffy seeds carried by the wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Botanically, it is characterized by its basal leaves and the absence of a distinct stem."
