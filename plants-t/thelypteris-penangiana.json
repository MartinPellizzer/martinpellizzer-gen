    "intro": "Thelypteris penangiana, commonly known as the Penang holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
