    "intro": "Tectaria panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that often exhibit a distinctive shield-like shape. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Tectaria panamensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
