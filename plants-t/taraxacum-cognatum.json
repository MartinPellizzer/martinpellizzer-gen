    "intro": "Taraxacum cognatum, commonly known as the Italian dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant is native to southern Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It produces a long, slender seed stem with a crown of bracts that release seeds via the wind. Taraxacum cognatum is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in herbal remedies."
