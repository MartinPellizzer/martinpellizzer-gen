    "intro": "Thouinia trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf thornapple, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a palmate pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, facilitating its spread in natural environments."
