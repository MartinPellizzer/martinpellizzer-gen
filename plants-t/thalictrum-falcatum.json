    "intro": "Thalictrum falcatum, commonly known as the bowles' meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply lobed and emit a mild, spicy fragrance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in upright, branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its graceful appearance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
