    "intro": "Theriophonum infaustum, commonly known as the cursed lichen, is a rare and enigmatic organism found in remote, subterranean environments. It is a symbiotic composite of fungi and algae, forming a unique structure that thrives in low-light, nutrient-poor conditions. The plant's appearance is characterized by its dark, moss-like growth with a faint bioluminescent glow under certain conditions. It is believed to have medicinal properties, though its use is highly controversial due to its toxic byproducts. Despite its potential, Theriophonum infaustum remains poorly studied due to its elusive nature and the dangers associated with its habitat."
