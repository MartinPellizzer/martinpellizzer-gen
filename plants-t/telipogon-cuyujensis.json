    "intro": "Telipogon cuyujensis, commonly known as the Cuyuj\u00e9n orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean highlands of Peru. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-white with subtle markings, adapted to its high-altitude environment. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
