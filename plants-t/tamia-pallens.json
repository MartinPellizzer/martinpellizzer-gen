    "intro": "Tamia pallens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale, ghost-like appearance, with white or pale green flowers that resemble a spectral form. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in wetlands or swamps. Due to its limited habitat and ecological sensitivity, Tamia pallens is considered a vulnerable species."
