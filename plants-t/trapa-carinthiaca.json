    "intro": "Trapa carinthiaca, commonly known as the Carpathian water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant features floating leaves with a waxy surface and distinctive, spiny fruits that mature underwater. Its reproductive strategy involves the dispersal of seeds through water, aided by the buoyant, floating seeds. Trapa carinthiaca plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
