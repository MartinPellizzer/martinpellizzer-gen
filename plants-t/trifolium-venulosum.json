    "intro": "Trifolium venulosum, commonly known as the slender clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Trifolium venulosum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
