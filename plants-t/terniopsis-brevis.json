    "intro": "Terniopsis brevis, commonly known as the short-leaved terniopsis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical features include a short, stout stem and a distinctive arrangement of leaves that are often described as fern-like. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Terniopsis brevis is considered a species of conservation concern."
