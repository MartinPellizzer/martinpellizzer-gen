    "intro": "Trichomanes delicatulum, commonly known as the delicate holly fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has finely divided, delicate fronds that are typically arching and covered in tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes delicatulum is often used in ornamental gardening for its elegant, lace-like appearance."
