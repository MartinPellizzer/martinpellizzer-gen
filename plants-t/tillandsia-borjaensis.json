    "intro": "Tillandsia borjaensis, commonly known as the Borja's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Ecuador. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often sought after by botanists and plant enthusiasts."
