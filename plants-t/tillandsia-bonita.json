    "intro": "Tillandsia bonita, commonly known as the beautiful air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It thrives by attaching itself to trees or other surfaces without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers, which are typically pink or white, bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its low maintenance and unique appearance, Tillandsia bonita is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
