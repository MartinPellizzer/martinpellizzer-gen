    "intro": "Thelypteris brauseanum, commonly known as the Brause's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering. Thelypteris brauseanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
