    "intro": "Trymalium capsulare, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family, which includes many species with showy flowers and succulent leaves. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Trymalium capsulare is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
