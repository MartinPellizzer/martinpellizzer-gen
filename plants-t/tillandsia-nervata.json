    "intro": "Tillandsia nervata, commonly known as the silver vane air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to maintain moisture. Tillandsia nervata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
