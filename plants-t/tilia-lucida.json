    "intro": "Tilia lucida, commonly known as the whitebeam or white-treed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks. Tilia lucida is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in European landscapes."
