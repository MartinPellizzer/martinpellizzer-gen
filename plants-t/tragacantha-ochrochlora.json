    "intro": "Tragacantha ochrochlora, commonly known as the yellow tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. Tragacantha ochrochlora thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments."
