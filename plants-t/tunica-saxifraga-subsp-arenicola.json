    "intro": "Tunica saxifraga subsp. arenicola, commonly known as the sand saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in nutrient-poor environments. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals, and bloom in early summer. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
