    "intro": "Taraxacum obnuptum, commonly known as the woolly dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. Its flowers develop into a distinctive, spherical seed head known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. This species is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats across temperate regions."
