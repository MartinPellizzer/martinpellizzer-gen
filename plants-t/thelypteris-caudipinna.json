    "intro": "Thelypteris caudipinna, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive silvery underside that gives it a unique appearance. Thelypteris caudipinna thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
