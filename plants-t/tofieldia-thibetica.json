    "intro": "Tofieldia thibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, making it an obligate parasite. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, Tofieldia thibetica is of interest to botanists studying plant-parasite relationships."
