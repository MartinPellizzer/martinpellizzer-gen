    "intro": "Thevetia pinifolia, commonly known as the pineapple tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its palm-like appearance with long, narrow leaves. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to its ornamental value and toxic properties, it is often cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
