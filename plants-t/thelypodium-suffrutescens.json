    "intro": "Thelypodium suffrutescens, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in dry, well-drained soils. It is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures, making it a hardy species in harsh climates. Thelypodium suffrutescens plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky areas and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
