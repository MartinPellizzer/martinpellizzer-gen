    "intro": "Tecomanthe volubilis, commonly known as the climbing nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a vigorous climber with tendrils that allow it to ascend trees and structures. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, often blooming at night. Its fruits are small, red berries that contain seeds, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
