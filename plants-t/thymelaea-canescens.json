    "intro": "Thymelaea canescens, commonly known as the silver thymelaea, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, pubescent hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
