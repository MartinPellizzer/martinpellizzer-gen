    "intro": "Trichocereus pachanoi, commonly known as the sacred cactus or sky cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers during the night, which are typically short-lived but highly fragrant. It is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Its botanical features make it a unique subject of study in both horticulture and ethnobotany."
