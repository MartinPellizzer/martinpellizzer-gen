    "intro": "Thrinax punctulata, commonly known as the Florida fan palm, is a striking member of the Arecaceae family native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, slow-growing palm with a short trunk and a dense crown of feather-like leaves. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, and segmented trunk, which is covered in a thick, fibrous layer. Its leaves are typically bright green, with a waxy texture and a subtle, sweet fragrance. Thrinax punctulata thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal landscapes."
