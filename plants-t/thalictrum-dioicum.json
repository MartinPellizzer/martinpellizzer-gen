    "intro": "Thalictrum dioicum, commonly known as the common meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is dioecious, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants. Thalictrum dioicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in its native habitats."
