    "intro": "Tectaria subfuscipes, commonly known as the black-footed tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Tectaria subfuscipes is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
