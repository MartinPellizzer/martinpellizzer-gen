    "intro": "Triticum poltawense, commonly known as Polish wheat, is a wild species of wheat native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. Triticum poltawense is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to modern wheat breeding programs."
