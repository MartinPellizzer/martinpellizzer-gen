    "intro": "Tetraena geslinii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in the spring and summer. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through mechanisms such as succulent leaves and deep root systems. Tetraena geslinii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
