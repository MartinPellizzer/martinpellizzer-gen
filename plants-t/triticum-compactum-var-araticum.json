    "intro": "Triticum compactum var. araticum, commonly known as the Brazilian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
