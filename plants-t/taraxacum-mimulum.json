    "intro": "Taraxacum mimulum, commonly known as the mouse-ear hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of oval, hairy leaves that resemble mouse ears, hence its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into elongated, bristly seed heads, typical of the Compositae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Taraxacum mimulum is known for its medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and diuretic effects."
