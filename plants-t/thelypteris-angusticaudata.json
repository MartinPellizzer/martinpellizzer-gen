    "intro": "Thelypteris angusticaudata, commonly known as the narrow-tailed maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps retain moisture. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive elongated shape that contributes to its ornamental appeal."
