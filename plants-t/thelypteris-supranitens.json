    "intro": "Thelypteris supranitens, commonly known as the glossy wood fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, evergreen fronds that are glossy and leathery in texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are usually arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
