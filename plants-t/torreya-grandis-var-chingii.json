    "intro": "Torreya grandis var. chingii, commonly known as the Chinese torreya, is a rare and relict species native to southern China. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its elongated, needle-like leaves and conical shape. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years. It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered endangered and is cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
