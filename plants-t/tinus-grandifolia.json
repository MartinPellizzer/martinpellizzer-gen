    "intro": "Tinus grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaf tinus, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Tinus grandifolia is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats."
