    "intro": "Tarenna stellulata, commonly known as the star-leaved tarenna, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical, leathery leaves with a distinctive star-shaped pattern on the underside. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Tarenna stellulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
