It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are elliptical with a glossy surface, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
