    "intro": "Tectaria subebenea, commonly known as the broad-leaf tectaria, is a fern species belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in specialized structures called sorus. The plant's morphology and growth habits make it well adapted to humid, low-light conditions in its native habitats."
