    "intro": "Tephrosia aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and are often used in traditional medicine. The plant is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils, making it useful in land rehabilitation efforts."
