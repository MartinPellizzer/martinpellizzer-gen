    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudohamatum, commonly known as the Japanese dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It is native to East Asia and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is sometimes grown in gardens and greenhouses."
