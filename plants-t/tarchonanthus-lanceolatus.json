    "intro": "Tarchonanthus lanceolatus, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. It produces hard, woody fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Due to its dense wood and drought tolerance, it is valued for both ecological and traditional uses."
