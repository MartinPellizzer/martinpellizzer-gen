    "intro": "Trichodesma lithospermoides, commonly known as the rock privet, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its small, opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elliptical, dark blue-black berries. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
