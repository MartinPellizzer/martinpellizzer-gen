It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth compared to the typical form of T. gallicum."
