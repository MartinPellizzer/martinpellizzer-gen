It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 50 centimeters in diameter, with a distinctive arrowhead shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of dense forests. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
