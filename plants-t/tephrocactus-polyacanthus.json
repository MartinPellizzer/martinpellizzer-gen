    "intro": "Tephrocactus polyacanthus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a columnar cactus with a rounded, spiny stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its thick, water-storing stems help it survive in arid environments. The plant is well adapted to full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
