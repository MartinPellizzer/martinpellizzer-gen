    "intro": "Tetrorchidium, commonly known as the four-lobed orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to various regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. The plant is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that display four distinct lobes, giving it its name. Tetrorchidium species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks. These plants require specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and indirect sunlight, to thrive."
