    "intro": "Tilia alba var. viridis, commonly known as the green-leaf linden, is a variant of the white linden tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive dark green, oval-shaped leaves that remain vibrant throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. It prefers well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often thriving in temperate climates. The leaves and flowers are used in traditional medicine and as a source of honey due to their aromatic properties."
