    "intro": "Trichomanes ankersii var. tanaicum, commonly known as the Tana Island huperborea, is a rare fern species native to the Tana Island in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, thin, and often translucent fronds. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with small, closely spaced leaves that are typically arranged in two ranks. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on rocky substrates or in moist, shaded forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species with conservation concerns."
