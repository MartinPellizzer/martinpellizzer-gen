    "intro": "Tyleria terrae-humilis, commonly known as the terrestrial lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic algal or cyanobacterial partner. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks, soil, or decaying wood. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the intertwined partners. It plays a crucial role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecological health."
