    "intro": "Trillium sessile var. praecox, commonly known as early-flowering white trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its three heart-shaped leaves and a single white flower with three petals and three sepals. The plant typically grows in rich, moist woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade. It produces a capsule fruit containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is notable for its early spring bloom, often appearing before many other woodland plants."
