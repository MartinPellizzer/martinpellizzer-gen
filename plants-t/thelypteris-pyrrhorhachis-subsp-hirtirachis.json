    "intro": "Thelypteris pyrrhorhachis subsp. hirtirachis, commonly known as the hairy cliff fern, is a terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive hairy texture on the underside. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and shaded forest floors, thriving in humid, temperate climates. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
