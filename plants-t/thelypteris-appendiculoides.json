    "intro": "Thelypteris appendiculoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, horizontal underground stems that allow it to colonize rocky or shaded areas. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a dense, foliage-like appearance. Thelypteris appendiculoides is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
