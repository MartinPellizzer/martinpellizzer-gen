These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. Trigonochilum species are characterized by their unique, star-shaped flowers that often display vibrant colors such as yellow, orange, and red.

The genus includes several species, with Trigonochilum coccineum being one of the most well-known for its striking red flowers."
