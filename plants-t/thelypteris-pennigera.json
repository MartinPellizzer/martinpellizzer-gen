    "intro": "Thelypteris pennigera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it forms dense colonies. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of rhizome scales, which contribute to its ability to retain moisture. The spores are produced in sori that are arranged along the margins of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
