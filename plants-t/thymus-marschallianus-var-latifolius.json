    "intro": "Thymus marschallianus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, aromatic leaves that are typically broader than those of other thyme varieties. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its foliage is used in culinary applications and traditional medicine due to its essential oils and aromatic properties."
