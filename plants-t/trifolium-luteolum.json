    "intro": "Trifolium luteolum, commonly known as yellow trefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Yellow trefoil is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant for soil enrichment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and meadows."
