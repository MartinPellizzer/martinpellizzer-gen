    "intro": "Tapinanthus brunneus subsp. buchholzii, commonly known as the African dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to southern Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the stems of other plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, vine-like appearance. It is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas, where it can spread rapidly. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
