    "intro": "Thalictrum foetidum, commonly known as stinking beggar's ticks, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is characterized by its unique, often unpleasant odor, which is more noticeable when the flowers are in bloom. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Thalictrum foetidum is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ecological value to pollinators."
