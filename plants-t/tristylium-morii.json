    "intro": "Tristylium morii, commonly known as the three-styled morii, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring three distinct stigmas that protrude prominently from the central pistil. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Tristylium morii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its striking floral morphology."
