    "intro": "Thorncroftia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered thornplant, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are covered in sharp, protective thorns. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. Thorncroftia longiflora is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, where it thrives with minimal rainfall."
