It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. The plant features narrow, slightly hairy leaves and produces small, blue or purple flowers in summer. Its sticky secretions on the stems and leaves are a distinguishing characteristic. Teucrium viscidum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
