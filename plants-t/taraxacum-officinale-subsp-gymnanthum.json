    "intro": "Taraxacum officinale subsp. gymnanthum, commonly known as the lesser dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head produces a cluster of bright yellow ray florets surrounded by disk florets, which develop into a crown of white, fluffy seeds. This subspecies is distinguished by its smaller and more compact flower head compared to the common dandelion. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens."
