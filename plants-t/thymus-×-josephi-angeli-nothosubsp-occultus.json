    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 josephi-angeli nothosubsp. occultus, commonly known as the rare hybrid thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to specific regions of southern Europe. It features small, aromatic leaves and flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, characteristic of the Thymus genus. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its botanical significance lies in its hybrid origin, combining traits from its parent species, T. josephi and T. angeli. Due to its limited distribution and unique genetic makeup, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
