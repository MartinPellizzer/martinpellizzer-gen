    "intro": "Tupistra macrostigma, commonly known as the silver carpet plant, is a low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features dense, mat-forming growth with fleshy, blue-green leaves that have a silvery-white coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
