    "intro": "Tapinanthus thollonii, commonly known as the parasitic nightshade, is a flowering plant in the family Solanaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from a host plant while also performing photosynthesis. Native to southern Africa, it typically grows on the roots of other plants, such as Acacia species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, often vine-like appearance. Its botanical interest lies in its unique parasitic relationship and its role in local ecosystems."
