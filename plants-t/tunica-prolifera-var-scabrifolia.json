    "intro": "Tunica prolifera var. scabrifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf tunica, is a unique species belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves that give it its scientific name \"scabrifolia,\" meaning \"rough-leaved.\" The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is native to certain regions of the Mediterranean. Its stems are often branched and can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters. The flowers are small and clustered, producing a distinctive pinkish hue that adds to its ornamental appeal."
