    "intro": "Trifolium medium var. majus, commonly known as the greater red clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a distinctive white or pale green vein. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in dense clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. This species is also valued for its role in agriculture as a forage crop and for its use in traditional herbal medicine."
