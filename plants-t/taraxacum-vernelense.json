It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, thriving in open, disturbed soils. It produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed with a parachute-like structure called a pappus. Taraxacum vernelense is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other sunny habitats."
