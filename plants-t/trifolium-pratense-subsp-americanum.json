    "intro": "Trifolium pratense subsp. americanum, commonly known as red clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pink or purple flower heads that are clustered in spherical or cylindrical shapes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Red clover is a valuable forage plant and also has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a nitrogen-fixing cover crop."
