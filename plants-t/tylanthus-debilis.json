    "intro": "Tylanthus debilis, commonly known as the weak tylanthus, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually lance-shaped and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in the spring. Tylanthus debilis is known for its delicate appearance and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
