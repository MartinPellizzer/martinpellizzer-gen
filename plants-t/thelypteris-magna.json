    "intro": "Thelypteris magna, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped appearance that gives it its common name. Thelypteris magna thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks."
