    "intro": "Tetraena tenuis, commonly known as the narrowleaf tetraena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a small shrub characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments, with deep roots and a low profile to reduce water loss. Tetraena tenuis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens."
