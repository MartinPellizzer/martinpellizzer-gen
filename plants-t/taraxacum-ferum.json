    "intro": "Taraxacum ferum, commonly known as the greater dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a slightly bitter taste. The plant produces a single, hollow, yellow flower head that develops into a tuft of white, parachute-like seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full sun. Taraxacum ferum is known for its deep taproot, which makes it resilient and difficult to uproot."
