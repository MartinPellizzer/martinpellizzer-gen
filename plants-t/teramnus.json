    "intro": "Teramnus, commonly known as the common tamarisk, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Tamaricaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Teramnus lappata, which is native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with small, scale-like leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. It is often found in saline or arid environments, showing adaptability to harsh conditions. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats."
