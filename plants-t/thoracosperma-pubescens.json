    "intro": "Thoracosperma pubescens, commonly known as the hairy mangrove, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its woody structure and salt-tolerant adaptations. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in coastal environments. It produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. This species plays an important ecological role in mangrove ecosystems by stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
