    "intro": "Thymus sessilifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has woody stems that become more pronounced with age, and its leaves are small, oval, and often covered in a fine layer of white, woolly hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover. The aromatic leaves and flowers are used in cooking and traditional medicine, offering both culinary and medicinal value."
