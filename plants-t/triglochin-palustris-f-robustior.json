    "intro": "Triglochin palustris f. robustior, commonly known as the robust marsh arrowhead, is a variant of the marsh arrowhead plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its broader, more robust leaves compared to the typical form, which helps it thrive in saturated soils. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral display. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize wetland areas effectively. Triglochin palustris f. robustior plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
