    "intro": "Tetracanthus humilis, commonly known as the small-stemmed bristly sedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, ribbed leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense clumps near water bodies. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces small, three-angled fruits. Tetracanthus humilis is generally short-lived and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
