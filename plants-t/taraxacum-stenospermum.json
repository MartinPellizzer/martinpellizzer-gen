    "intro": "Taraxacum stenospermum, commonly known as the narrow-sepal dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a pappus-equipped seed head. Native to Europe, it is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its widespread distribution. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
