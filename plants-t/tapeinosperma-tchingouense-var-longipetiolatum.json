    "intro": "Tapeinosperma tchingouense var. longipetiolatum, commonly known as the long-petioled tchingou tamarind, is a variant of the tamarind tree native to West Africa. It is characterized by its long, slender petioles that support its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate in structure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The botanical features of this variant make it distinct from other members of the genus Tapeinosperma."
