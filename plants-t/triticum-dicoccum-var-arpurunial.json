    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum var. arpurunial, commonly known as einkorn, is a primitive wheat species that originated in the Fertile Crescent. It is characterized by its small, hulled grains and high protein content, making it nutritionally rich. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in a tough hull, which must be removed for consumption. This variety is valued for its ancient grain qualities and is often cultivated for organic and heirloom farming practices."
