    "intro": "Tractema odorata, commonly known as sweetflag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. Tractema odorata is also known for its aromatic leaves, which have been used traditionally in various herbal remedies."
