    "intro": "Tribulus sericeus var. humifusus, commonly known as the silky tribulus, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the early morning. The plant has slender, hairy stems and small, elliptical leaves with a waxy coating, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
