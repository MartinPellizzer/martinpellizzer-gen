    "intro": "Tilia mandshurica f. depressa, commonly known as the Mongolian linden or dwarf linden, is a shrub-like form of the Tilia mandshurica species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense foliage and small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers in clusters during the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
