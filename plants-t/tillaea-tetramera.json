    "intro": "Tillaea tetramera, commonly known as the four-leaf tillaea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has hairy, woody stems and needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand coastal winds and salt spray. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the shorelines. Tillaea tetramera plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
