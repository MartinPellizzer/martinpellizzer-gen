It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by distinctive, fleshy, red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
