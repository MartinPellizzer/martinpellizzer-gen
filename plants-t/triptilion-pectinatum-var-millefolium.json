    "intro": "Triptilion pectinatum var. millefolium, commonly known as the fine-leaved triptilion, is a lesser-known member of the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. The variety 'millefolium' refers to its finely divided leaves, resembling the leaves of the fern family."
