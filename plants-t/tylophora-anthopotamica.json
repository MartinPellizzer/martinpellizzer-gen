    "intro": "Tylophora anthopotamica, commonly known as the African moonvine, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
