    "intro": "Thelocactus rinconensis subsp. phymatothelos, commonly known as the Rinc\u00f3n cactus, is a rare and distinctive cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are covered in a dense, white, woolly coating. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise desolate appearance. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
