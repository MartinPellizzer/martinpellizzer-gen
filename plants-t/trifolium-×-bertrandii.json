    "intro": "Trifolium \u00d7 bertrandii, commonly known as the hybrid white clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense heads, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. Trifolium \u00d7 bertrandii is valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage crop for livestock."
