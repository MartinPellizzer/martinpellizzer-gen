    "intro": "Tragia nepetifolia, commonly known as the hairy false nettle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, three-lobed capsule that dehisces to release the seeds. Tragia nepetifolia is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and waste areas."
