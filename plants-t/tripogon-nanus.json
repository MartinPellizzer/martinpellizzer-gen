    "intro": "Tripogon nanus, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a small perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in a rosette. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its compact size and adaptability, it is a common species in various aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
