    "intro": "Tamamschjanella rubella, commonly known as the red-flowered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically a vibrant red or pink, with five petals and a tubular throat. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
