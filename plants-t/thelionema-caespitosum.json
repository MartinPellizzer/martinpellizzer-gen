    "intro": "Thelionema caespitosum, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a shrub native to coastal areas of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, aromatic leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are often visited by native pollinators. It is well adapted to salty sea air and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in coastal environments. Thelionema caespitosum is also valued for its use in traditional Aboriginal medicine and as a source of essential oils."
