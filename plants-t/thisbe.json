    "intro": "Thisbe, commonly known as the \"lady's tears\" or \"false lilies,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaryllidaceae. It consists of several species, including Thisbe inanis and Thisbe kirilowii, which are native to regions of Asia and the Mediterranean. The plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. They typically grow as herbaceous perennials, often found in woodland or rocky habitats. The foliage consists of strap-like leaves, and the flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
