    "intro": "Tragacantha reinii, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southwestern Asia, particularly Iran and Afghanistan. The plant is characterized by its woody structure, compound leaves, and distinctive yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring. It produces a valuable gum, known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent. Tragacantha reinii is well adapted to dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
