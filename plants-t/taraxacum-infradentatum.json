    "intro": "Taraxacum infradentatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, serrated leaves and a yellow flowering head that produces fluffy seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is known for its ability to spread through wind-dispersed seeds, making it a common sight in open habitats. Its botanical features make it easily distinguishable from other dandelion species."
