    "intro": "Tragopogon major, commonly known as the common goatsbeard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a distinctive seed head that resembles a crown, with bracts that are often tinged with purple or red. Its leaves are long, narrow, and slightly hairy, forming a basal rosette. Tragopogon major is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
