    "intro": "Taraxacum calciphilum, commonly known as the limestone dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to calcareous soils in Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a single, tall, hairy stem that bears a yellow flower head. The plant is adapted to grow in alkaline environments, often found in limestone grasslands and rocky soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. Taraxacum calciphilum is of interest to botanists due to its specialized habitat and ecological role in calcareous ecosystems."
