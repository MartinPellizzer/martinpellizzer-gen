    "intro": "Tragopogon glaber, commonly known as the common goatherb, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of basal, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a distinctive central tuft of bristles, which are followed by slender, hairless seed stalks. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Tragopogon glaber is known for its ability to hybridize with other species in the genus, leading to the creation of new, often sterile hybrids."
