    "intro": "Tolumnia acunae, commonly known as the Acuna's tolumnia, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments and has palmate leaves with a velvety texture. Its blooming period occurs during the rainy season, and it plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators. Due to habitat loss, Tolumnia acunae is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
