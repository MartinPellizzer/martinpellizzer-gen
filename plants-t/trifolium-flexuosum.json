    "intro": "Trifolium flexuosum, commonly known as the creeping clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a slender stem. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, typically in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks. Trifolium flexuosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
