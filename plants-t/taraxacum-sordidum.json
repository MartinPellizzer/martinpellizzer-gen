    "intro": "Taraxacum sordidum, commonly known as the dirty dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, dark green leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. It produces a distinctive seed head with parachute-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its robust nature, it is considered a weed in many agricultural and garden settings."
