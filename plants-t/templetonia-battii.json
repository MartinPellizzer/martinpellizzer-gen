    "intro": "Templetonia battii, commonly known as the red-flowered templetonia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive red, tubular flowers that bloom in spring and attract native pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant has lance-shaped, glossy leaves and produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade. Templetonia battii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat."
