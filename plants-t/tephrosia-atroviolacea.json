    "intro": "Tephrosia atroviolacea, commonly known as black velvet tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually violet or purple in color, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Tephrosia atroviolacea is also valued for its potential use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
