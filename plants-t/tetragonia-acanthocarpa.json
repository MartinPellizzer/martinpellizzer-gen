    "intro": "Tetragonia acanthocarpa, commonly known as the prickly goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Chenopodiaceae family, which includes many salt-tolerant species. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in small spines, providing a defense mechanism against herbivores. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Tetragonia acanthocarpa is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
