    "intro": "Taraxacum zelotes, commonly known as the hairy dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust taproot system. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. Its yellow flowering heads produce numerous small seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a common trait among members of the dandelion genus. Taraxacum zelotes is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, where it thrives in sunny conditions."
