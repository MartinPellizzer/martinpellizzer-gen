    "intro": "Triumfetta dembianensis, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and small, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by round, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodland or savanna habitats. Due to its durable wood, it has been historically used for construction and tool-making in local communities."
