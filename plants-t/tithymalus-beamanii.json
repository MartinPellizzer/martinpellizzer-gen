    "intro": "Tithymalus beamanii, commonly known as the Beaman's tithymalus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its small, daisy-like flowers are usually white or pale blue, with yellow centers, and bloom during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
