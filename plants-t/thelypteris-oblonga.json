    "intro": "Thelypteris oblonga, commonly known as the broad-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Thelypteris oblonga produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in lines along the veins."
