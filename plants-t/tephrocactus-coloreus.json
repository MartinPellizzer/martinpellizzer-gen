It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green with red or purple tips. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the arid environment. Due to its striking appearance and unique adaptations, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
