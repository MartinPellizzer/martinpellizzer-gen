    "intro": "Taraktogenos microcarpa, commonly known as the desert ironwood, is a slow-growing, evergreen shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deep underground, making it highly drought-tolerant. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. The plant's hard, heavy wood has been historically used by indigenous peoples for tools and construction."
