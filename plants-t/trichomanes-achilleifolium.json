    "intro": "Trichomanes achilleifolium, commonly known as the fern of Achilles, is a delicate evergreen fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of its fronds, a common feature in ferns. Trichomanes achilleifolium is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is appreciated for its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soil."
