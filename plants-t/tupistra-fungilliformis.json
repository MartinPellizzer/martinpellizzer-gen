    "intro": "Tupistra fungilliformis, commonly known as the fairy fan or fairy brush, is a unique succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a dense, cushion-like growth habit with many small, fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that resemble tiny fans. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are borne on short, leafless stems. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Due to its ornamental appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
