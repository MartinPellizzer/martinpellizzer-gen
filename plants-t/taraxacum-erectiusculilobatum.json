    "intro": "Taraxacum erectiusculilobatum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are narrow and lobed, with a rough, hairy texture, and the plant produces a fluffy seed head that disperses its seeds by wind. It is typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across temperate regions. This plant plays a role in supporting pollinators and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
