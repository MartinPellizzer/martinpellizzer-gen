    "intro": "Tamarix furas, commonly known as the desert rose, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and pink or red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Tamarix furas is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
