    "intro": "Trichoglottis luchuensis, commonly known as the Luchuan orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, strap-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive trichome-covered lip. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
