It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain seeds with tufted hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and woodland areas.
