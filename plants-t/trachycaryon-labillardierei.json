    "intro": "Trachycaryon labillardierei, commonly known as the silky oak, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a large tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, grey bark and broad, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, spherical fruits. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant its common name and contributing to its distinctive appearance. The silky oak is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and inland forests."
