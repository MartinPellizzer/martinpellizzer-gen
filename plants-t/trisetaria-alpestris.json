    "intro": "Trisetaria alpestris, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and provides habitat for small invertebrates. Due to its ecological significance, it is often found in alpine meadows and tundra habitats."
