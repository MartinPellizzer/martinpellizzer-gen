    "intro": "Tunica phthiotica, commonly known as the Phthiotis tunica, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, clustered white or yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the dry, temperate climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a mild, aromatic scent, contributing to its botanical interest. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
