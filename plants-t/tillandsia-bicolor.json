    "intro": "Tillandsia bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green with a striking white or silver stripe along the edges. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires minimal watering, making it well-suited for indoor environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for both collectors and indoor gardeners."
