    "intro": "Tradescantia virginica var. villosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf spiderwort, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features lance-shaped, hairy leaves that give it its common name, and it produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a hardy ornamental and a potential weed. Its foliage and flowers provide nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
