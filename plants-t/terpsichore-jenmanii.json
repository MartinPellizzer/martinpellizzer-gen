    "intro": "Terpsichore jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its striking, pale green to white flowers with intricate patterns resembling ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, growing on the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from its host. Its delicate appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for its protection."
