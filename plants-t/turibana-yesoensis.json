    "intro": "Turibana yesoensis, commonly known as the Yesso turibana, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Japan. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and knotweed. The plant features striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its maritime environment. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Turibana yesoensis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
