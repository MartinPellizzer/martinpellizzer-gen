    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum var. tomentosum, commonly known as black rye, is a wild relative of wheat characterized by its dark, husk-covered grains. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often found in forested areas and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tightly packed florets. Its seeds are rich in nutrients and have been used in traditional foods and remedies. Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest in agricultural research for improving wheat varieties."
