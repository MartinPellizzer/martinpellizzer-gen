    "intro": "Tragacantha raphiodontha, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its rough, fissured bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. It is valued for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important species in desert ecosystems. The gum produced by the tree has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive."
