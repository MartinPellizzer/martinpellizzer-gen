    "intro": "Thelypteris grandis var. kunzeana, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern genus native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, triangular-shaped fronds that are often deeply divided into lanceolate segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with spore-bearing structures on the underside of the leaves."
