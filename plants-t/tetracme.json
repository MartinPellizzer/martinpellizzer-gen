It consists of several species that are native to various regions of Africa, particularly in the southern part of the continent. The plants typically have basal leaves that are often hairy and alternate along the stem. They produce small, yellow flowers that are arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. The fruits are small, dry achenes with pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal."
