The plant has small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. Tragia hirsuta is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with mechanisms to store water and reduce transpiration."
