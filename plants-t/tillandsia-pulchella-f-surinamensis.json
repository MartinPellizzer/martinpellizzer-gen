    "intro": "Tillandsia pulchella f. surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. This variety is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities."
