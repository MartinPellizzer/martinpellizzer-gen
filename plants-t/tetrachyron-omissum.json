    "intro": "Tetrachyron omissum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, slender stems and produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Tetrachyron omissum is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
