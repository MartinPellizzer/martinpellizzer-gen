    "intro": "Tectaria pleocnemioides, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments with a wavy margin. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome is creeping and produces adventitious roots, which help anchor it to rocky or moist substrates. Tectaria pleocnemioides is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in moist ecosystems."
