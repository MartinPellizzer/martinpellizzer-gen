    "intro": "Trifolium leucophaeum, commonly known as the white clover, is a species of legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full sun to partial shade. Trifolium leucophaeum is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
