    "intro": "Teagueia kostoglouana, commonly known as the Kostoglou's teagueia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment. Conservation efforts are essential to preserve this unique botanical species."
