    "intro": "Thrinax ponceana, commonly known as the Ponceana palm, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Bahamas. It is a small, slow-growing palm with a slender trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that develop into round, dark purple fruits. Its leaves are pinnate, with long, narrow segments, and the plant is often used in ornamental landscaping. Thrinax ponceana is adapted to coastal environments and can tolerate salt spray, making it a resilient plant in tropical climates."
