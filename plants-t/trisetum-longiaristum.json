    "intro": "Trisetum longiaristum, commonly known as the long-awned feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, slender leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces fluffy, spike-like inflorescences that are composed of numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Trisetum longiaristum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
