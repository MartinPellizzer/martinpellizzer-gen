    "intro": "Triticum orientale var. lasianthum, commonly known as the Persian wheat, is a botanical variety native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces edible grains that are similar in appearance to common wheat but are often used in traditional local cuisines. Its seeds are rich in carbohydrates and proteins, making it a valuable crop for both sustenance and agricultural study. However, it is less commonly cultivated today due to its lower yield compared to modern wheat varieties."
