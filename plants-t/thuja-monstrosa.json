    "intro": "Thuja monstrosa, commonly known as the twisted cedar, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to Europe. It is characterized by its unique, contorted growth habit, which gives it a whimsical and ornamental appearance. The plant features scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, arranged in dense, flat sprays. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green cones, typical of the Cupressaceae family. Thuja monstrosa is often cultivated in gardens for its visual interest and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
