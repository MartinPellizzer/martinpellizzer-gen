    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum subsp. atlanticus, commonly known as coastal thyme, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the Atlantic coastal regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, aromatic leaves and produces small, pink to purple flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes, coastal bluffs, and other maritime environments. It is drought-tolerant and well adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. Its essential oils contain thymol and carvacrol, giving it a strong, pungent aroma and making it valuable for both culinary and medicinal uses."
