    "intro": "Tricholaena arenaria var. semiglabra, commonly known as the sand flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or marshy environments. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually shorter and less hairy compared to other varieties of Tricholaena. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
