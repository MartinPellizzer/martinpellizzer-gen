    "intro": "Tium nevinii, commonly known as the Nevin's tium, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive in partial shade. Its flowers are small and clustered, often producing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Tium nevinii is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
