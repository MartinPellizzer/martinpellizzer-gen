    "intro": "Thelypteris limbata, commonly known as the marginal maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside of the leaves."
