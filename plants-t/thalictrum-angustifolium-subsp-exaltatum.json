    "intro": "Thalictrum angustifolium subsp. exaltatum, commonly known as the tall meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are narrow and arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. The plant produces showy, spire-like clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and pollinator support."
