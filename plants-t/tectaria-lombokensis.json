    "intro": "Tectaria lombokensis, commonly known as the Lombok shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is native to the Indonesian island of Flores and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a network of roots that help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
