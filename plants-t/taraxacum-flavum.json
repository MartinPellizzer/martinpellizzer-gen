    "intro": "Taraxacum flavum, commonly known as the yellow dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and a long, hollow stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in a variety of soil types, including disturbed or nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers produce numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common reproductive strategy among members of the dandelion genus. The plant is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a food source."
