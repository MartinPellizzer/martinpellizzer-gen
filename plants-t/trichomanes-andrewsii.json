    "intro": "Trichomanes andrewsii, commonly known as the Andrews' hart's-tongue fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a creeping rhizome with tightly clustered, lance-shaped fronds that have a distinctive, waxy texture. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Trichomanes andrewsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in woodland gardens."
