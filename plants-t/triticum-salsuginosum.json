    "intro": "Triticum salsuginosum, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and its ability to thrive in soils with high salt content. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its root system is adapted to absorb water from deep within the soil, making it drought-resistant. Triticum salsuginosum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils in saline habitats."
