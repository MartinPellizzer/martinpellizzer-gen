    "intro": "Thrixspermum gombakense, commonly known as the Gombak thrixspermum, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with five petals and prominent stamens, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
