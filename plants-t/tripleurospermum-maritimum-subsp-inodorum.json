    "intro": "Tripleurospermum maritimum subsp. inodorum, commonly known as the coastal cow parsley, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in salty and windy conditions. The plant features slender stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, contributing to its ability to retain moisture in arid environments. This subspecies is notable for its lack of a strong scent, distinguishing it from other members of the genus."
