    "intro": "Teucrium sinuatum, commonly known as narrowleaf germander, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, aromatic stems and small, opposite leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces clusters of tiny, tubular blue or violet flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its medicinal properties have been historically valued for their anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities."
