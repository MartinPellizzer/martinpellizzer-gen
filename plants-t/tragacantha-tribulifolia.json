    "intro": "Tragacantha tribulifolia, commonly known as the Persian gum or tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is a shrub that produces distinctive yellow flowers and is known for its sticky, resinous sap. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and its ability to thrive in arid environments. The resin, known as tragacanth, has been used historically in medicine and as a binding agent in food products. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and traditional contexts."
