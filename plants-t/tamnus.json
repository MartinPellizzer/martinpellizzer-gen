    "intro": "Tamnus, commonly known as the thistle or goat's beard, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their spiny leaves and showy composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk florets. Tamnus species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in rocky or sandy soils. They are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their distinctive appearance."
