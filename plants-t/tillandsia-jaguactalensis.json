    "intro": "Tillandsia jaguactalensis, commonly known as the jaguactalensis air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, adapting it to its often arid environment. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a delicate, bell-shaped structure. Tillandsia jaguactalensis is valued for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
