It features delicate, nodding yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has slender, branching stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that help it thrive in wet or shaded environments. It prefers rich, loamy soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive and ecologically valuable plant in native plant landscapes."
