    "intro": "Typha angustifolia f. foveolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cattail, is a variant of the common cattail species. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves that are typically darker green than the typical form. The plant produces cylindrical, brownish flower spikes that are often used in traditional crafts and ecological restoration projects. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond edges, where it plays a vital role in water filtration and habitat provision. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for wetland health and biodiversity."
