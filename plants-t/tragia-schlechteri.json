    "intro": "Tragia schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's tragia, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Tragia schlechteri is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
