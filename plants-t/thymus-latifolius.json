    "intro": "Thymus latifolius, commonly known as broadleaf thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically oval to ovate in shape, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces pink to lavender flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and herb gardens. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its medicinal and culinary uses."
