    "intro": "Triticum murale, commonly known as wall barley, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and along walls, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. While not widely cultivated for grain, it has been studied for its potential in ecological restoration and as a forage crop."
