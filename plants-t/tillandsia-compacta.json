    "intro": "Tillandsia compacta, commonly known as the compact air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant has dense, compact rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, pale flowers that are usually clustered at the center of the rosette. Tillandsia compacta is well adapted to dry and humid environments, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
