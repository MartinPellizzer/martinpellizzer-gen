    "intro": "Trichilia pauloensis, commonly known as the Brazilian sandpaper tree, is a deciduous tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other tropical hardwoods. The tree is characterized by its rough, sandpaper-like bark and compound leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are small and yellowish-green, typically appearing in clusters, while the fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Trichilia pauloensis is valued for its durable timber and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
