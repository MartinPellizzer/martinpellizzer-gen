    "intro": "Trema sieberi, commonly known as the small-leaved trema, is a tropical plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Trema sieberi is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in moist, shaded habitats. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical applications remain under-researched."
