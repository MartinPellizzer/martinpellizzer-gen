    "intro": "Tylecodon torulosus, commonly known as the yellow tree cactus, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its branched, woody stems that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Tylecodon torulosus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness."
