    "intro": "Trachydium elbrusense var. polyactis, commonly known as the Elbrus mountain lichen, is a rare lichen species found in the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus Mountains. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its foliose thallus with a distinct, bright yellow to orange coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with a specific species of cyanobacteria, which contributes to its unique pigmentation and nutrient acquisition. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found on rocky substrates at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
