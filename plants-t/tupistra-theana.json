    "intro": "Tupistra theana, commonly known as the African snowball, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, white, spherical flower heads that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are small, needle-like, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Tupistra theana is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
