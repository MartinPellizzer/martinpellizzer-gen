    "intro": "Terminalia carolinensis, commonly known as the Carolina boxwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, which consists of small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red berries in the fall. Terminalia carolinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its compact growth habit. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for hedges and foundation plantings."
