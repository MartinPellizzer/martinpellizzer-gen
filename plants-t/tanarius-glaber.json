It is native to certain regions of Africa and is typically found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy or smooth, depending on the species. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a typical pea-like structure. The seeds are enclosed in a leathery pod, which splits open to release the seeds when mature."
