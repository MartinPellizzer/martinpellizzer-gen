    "intro": "Trasus binervis var. androgynus, commonly known as the Androgynous Trasus, is a rare and unique variant of the Trasus binervis species. It is characterized by its distinctive bilateral symmetry and the presence of both male and female reproductive structures on the same individual, a trait known as androgynism. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate forest regions. Its leaves are elongated and have a finely serrated margin, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its rarity and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
