    "intro": "Tachigali albiflora, commonly known as whiteflower tachigali, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often blooming during the dry season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Tachigali albiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
