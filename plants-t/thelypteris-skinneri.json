It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the leaves."
