    "intro": "Taxus chinensis var. mairei, commonly known as the Yunnan yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to China. It is characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that contain the toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
