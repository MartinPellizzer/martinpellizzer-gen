    "intro": "Trillium tschonoskii f. morii, commonly known as the Morii's white trillium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its three large, white petals and three sepals that are often tinged with green, giving it a unique and elegant appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories where it thrives in rich, well-drained soil. It produces a single, upright stem that bears the showy flowers, which bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
