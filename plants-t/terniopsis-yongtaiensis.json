    "intro": "Terniopsis yongtaiensis, commonly known as the Yongtai fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to China. It belongs to the family Terniopsidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are bi-directionally pinnate, with a distinctive arrangement of small, lanceolate leaflets. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
