    "intro": "Triticum pruinosum, commonly known as the sticky wheat or Prussian wheat, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and spikes that bear small, pale blue to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its seeds are small and oval, with a distinctive sticky coating that aids in seed dispersal. Triticum pruinosum is not cultivated for grain production but is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
