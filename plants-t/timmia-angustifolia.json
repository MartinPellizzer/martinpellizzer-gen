    "intro": "Timmia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved timmia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as farina. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
