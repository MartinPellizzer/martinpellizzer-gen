    "intro": "Tragacantha oocarpa, commonly known as the giant globemallow, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive, inflated seed pods that remain on the plant well into the winter. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Tragacantha oocarpa is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions."
