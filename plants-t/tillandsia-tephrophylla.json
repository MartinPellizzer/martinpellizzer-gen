    "intro": "Tillandsia tephrophylla, commonly known as the tephrophylla air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom during the dry season. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
