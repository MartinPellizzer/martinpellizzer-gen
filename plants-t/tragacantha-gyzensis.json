    "intro": "Tragacantha gyzensis, commonly known as the Gyzan tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pods containing seeds. Its roots are known for their ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor environments. Tragacantha gyzensis is also valued for its gum, which has been used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive."
