    "intro": "Torreya fargesii subsp. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved torreya, is a rare and reclusive evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its elongated, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more slender than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years, and its seeds are dispersed by animals. It thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
