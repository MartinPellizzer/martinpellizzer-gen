    "intro": "Telipogon pubescens, commonly known as the hairy telipogon, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to the cold, dry climate of its habitat. Its floral structure includes a single, showy flower with a distinct lip, which is a common feature in many orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
