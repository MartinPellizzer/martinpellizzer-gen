    "intro": "Tupistra chlorantha, commonly known as the green tufted saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bright green leaves that form a compact, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in tight, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
