    "intro": "Tillandsia mosaic, commonly known as the mosaic air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its unique, overlapping leaf structure that forms a rosette, which helps it collect and retain moisture from the air. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil, as it absorbs nutrients through its leaves. Its striking, often variegated foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Tillandsia mosaic is also known for its ability to bloom with colorful, long-lasting flowers that can last for several weeks."
