    "intro": "Thalictrum foetidum subsp. foetidum, commonly known as stinkcup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, often hairy stems that produce clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. The plant has palmately divided leaves with five to seven lobes, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it is known for its mild, somewhat unpleasant odor."
