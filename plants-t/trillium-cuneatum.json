    "intro": "Trillium cuneatum, commonly known as the cuneate trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its three heart-shaped leaves and a single, showy white or pale pink flower that appears in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers have six tepals that are usually reflexed backward, and it produces red berries that contain seeds. Trillium cuneatum is an important component of the understory flora in its native habitats."
