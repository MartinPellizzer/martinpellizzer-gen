    "intro": "Triticum amplissifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf wheat, is a species of grass native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and dense spikelets that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. This plant typically grows in moist, fertile soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying grassland ecosystems and plant adaptations. However, it is not widely cultivated for agricultural purposes."
