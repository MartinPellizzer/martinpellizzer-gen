    "intro": "Thelypteris resinifera, commonly known as the resinous shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including parts of India, China, and Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Thelypteris resinifera is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
