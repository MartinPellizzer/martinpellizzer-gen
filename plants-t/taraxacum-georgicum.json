    "intro": "Taraxacum georgicum, commonly known as the Georgian dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the Caucasus region, including parts of Georgia, and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem and has a milky sap that is typical of the genus Taraxacum. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often growing in temperate climates. The seeds are dispersed by wind through a feathery pappus, allowing the plant to spread efficiently."
