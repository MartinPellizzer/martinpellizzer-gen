    "intro": "Trilix lutea, commonly known as the yellow trillium, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its three-petaled flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three broadly ovate leaflets, and it blooms in early spring. Trilix lutea is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
