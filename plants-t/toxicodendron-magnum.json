    "intro": "Toxicodendron magnum, commonly known as the giant poison ivy, is a woody shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically three to five leaflets arranged oppositely along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, round berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its sap contains urushiol, a potent allergen that can cause severe skin irritation and rashes upon contact. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in both natural and cultivated settings."
