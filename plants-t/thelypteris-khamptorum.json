    "intro": "Thelypteris khamptorum, commonly known as the Khamti fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Thelypteris khamptorum plays a role in maintaining forest biodiversity and soil stability in its native habitat."
