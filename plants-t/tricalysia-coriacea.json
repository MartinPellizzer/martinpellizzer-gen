    "intro": "Tricalysia coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, rough texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, woody fruits. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Tricalysia coriacea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests."
