    "intro": "Trichomanes arbuscula, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Huperjaniaceae and is characterized by its compact, branching structure with tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky surfaces. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of its leaves, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Trichomanes arbuscula is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and air-purifying properties."
