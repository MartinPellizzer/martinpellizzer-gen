    "intro": "Taeniophyllum keysseri, commonly known as the Madagascar button fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features delicate, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green with a slightly waxy texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a sought-after specimen among plant enthusiasts and conservationists."
