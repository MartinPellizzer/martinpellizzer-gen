    "intro": "Thymus balcanus var. decorus, commonly known as the Balkan thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and aromatic foliage with a strong thyme scent. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary uses, though it is less commonly cultivated than other thyme species."
