    "intro": "Thoracostachyum floribundum, commonly known as the Mexican firecracker cactus, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
