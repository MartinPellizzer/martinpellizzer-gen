    "intro": "Trixis frutescens var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf trixis, is a shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features dense, woody stems covered with small, glandular hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a slightly waxy coating to withstand dry conditions. This species is adapted to harsh environments and is often used in traditional medicine."
