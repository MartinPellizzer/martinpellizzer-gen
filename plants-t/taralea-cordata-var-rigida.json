It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its unique foliage and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings for its aesthetic appeal."
