    "intro": "Tetraneuris incana, commonly known as the woolly tetraneuris, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and have a distinctive fuzzy texture. Tetraneuris incana is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun conditions."
