    "intro": "Taraxacum microcephalum, commonly known as the dwarf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its small, pale yellow flowers and heart-shaped basal leaves. This plant is typically found in grassy areas and disturbed soils, often in temperate regions. It produces a capsule that contains numerous small seeds with white pappus for wind dispersal. The plant is relatively short, usually not exceeding 10 centimeters in height, making it easily overlooked in the wild."
