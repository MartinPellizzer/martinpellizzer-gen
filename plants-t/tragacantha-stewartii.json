    "intro": "Tragacantha stewartii, commonly known as Stewart's tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces a distinctive gum, similar to that of other tragacanth species, which has been used historically in various applications. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyons. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
