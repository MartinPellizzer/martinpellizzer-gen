    "intro": "Tragopogon melanantherus, commonly known as the black-rayed thistle, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces a striking purple to black central flower with yellow rays. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Tragopogon melanantherus is also known for its ability to hybridize with other Tragopogon species, leading to the creation of new, sometimes invasive, plant forms."
