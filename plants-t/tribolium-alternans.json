    "intro": "Tribolium alternans, commonly known as the alternate grain beetle, is a species of weevil belonging to the family Curculionidae. It is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical body and a distinctive alternating pattern of light and dark bands along its exoskeleton. This beetle is primarily found in stored grain environments, where it feeds on various cereal grains such as wheat, barley, and rice. Its life cycle involves a complete metamorphosis, with larvae developing within the grain kernels. The plant-related aspects of Tribolium alternans are minimal, as it is not a plant but an insect that infests plant products."
