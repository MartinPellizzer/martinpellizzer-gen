    "intro": "Tephrocactus conoideus, commonly known as the conical cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and full sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and rockeries."
