It features narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces yellow, daisy-like flowers with ray florets that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to arid environments and resistant to drought."
