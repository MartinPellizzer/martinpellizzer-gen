    "intro": "Taraxacum scabrum, commonly known as mouse ear hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of gray-green, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. It is typically found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. Taraxacum scabrum is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
