    "intro": "Tricholepis candolleana, commonly known as the Himalayan orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across mountainous terrain. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
