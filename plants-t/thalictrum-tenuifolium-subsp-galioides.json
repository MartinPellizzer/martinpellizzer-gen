    "intro": "Thalictrum tenuifolium subsp. galioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance, and it produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It is characterized by its rhizomatous root system and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
