    "intro": "Telotia, commonly known as the \"mud plant,\" is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Sordariaceae. It is characterized by its small, dark, and often clustered fruiting bodies that resemble tiny mushrooms. The plant thrives in moist, organic-rich environments, such as soil or decaying plant matter. Its spores are released in large quantities, contributing to its ability to colonize various substrates. Telotia plays a role in nutrient cycling by decomposing organic material in its habitat."
