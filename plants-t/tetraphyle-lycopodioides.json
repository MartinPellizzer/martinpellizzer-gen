    "intro": "Tetraphyle lycopodioides, commonly known as the four-leaf lycopod, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. Tetraphyle lycopodioides is typically found in moist, shaded environments and is considered a relic species with limited geographic distribution. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary history as a primitive member of the lycophyte group."
