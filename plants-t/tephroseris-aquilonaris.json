    "intro": "Tephroseris aquilonaris, commonly known as the wind-snow saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of northern North America. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and is a symbol of resilience in extreme climates."
