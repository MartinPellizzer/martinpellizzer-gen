    "intro": "Tinus helferiana, commonly known as the Helfer's tinus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from white to pink and purple. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
