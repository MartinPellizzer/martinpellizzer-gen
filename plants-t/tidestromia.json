    "intro": "Tidestromia, commonly known as the silverleaf or rock dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and rocky environments. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Tidestromia species typically have small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, and they are often found growing on limestone or sandstone substrates. These plants are adapted to withstand drought and are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements."
