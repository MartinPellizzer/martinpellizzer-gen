    "intro": "Trichomanes liukiuense, commonly known as the Ryukyu holly fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in humid forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichomanes liukiuense is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
