    "intro": "Tillandsia mixtecorum, commonly known as the Mixteca air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Mexico. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that collect water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It is well adapted to growing on trees or rocks, requiring minimal soil contact. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
