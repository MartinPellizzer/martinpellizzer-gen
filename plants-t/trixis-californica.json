    "intro": "Trixis californica, commonly known as the California trixis, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and open woodlands, and is adapted to arid conditions. It produces small, dry fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Trixis californica is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
