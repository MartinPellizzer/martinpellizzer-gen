    "intro": "Trispermium, commonly known as the \"three-seed plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Acanthaceae. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters, often in shades of red, pink, or white. The plant produces three seeds per fruit, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus. Trispermium species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and Asia. They are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks."
