    "intro": "Tillandsia lorentzii, commonly known as the Lorentz air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant that absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than roots. The plant features rosettes of narrow, pointed leaves that can trap water and debris. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of pink or red. Tillandsia lorentzii is well adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
