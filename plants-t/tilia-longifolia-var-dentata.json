    "intro": "Tilia longifolia var. dentata, commonly known as the serrated linden, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the wood is valued for its fine texture and workability."
