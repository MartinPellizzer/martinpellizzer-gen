    "intro": "Tillandsia ingens, commonly known as the giant air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette, capable of trapping moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and it produces offsets that can be separated to propagate new plants. Tillandsia ingens is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires indirect light and regular misting to thrive."
