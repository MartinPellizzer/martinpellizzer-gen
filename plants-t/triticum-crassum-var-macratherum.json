    "intro": "Triticum crassum var. macratherum, commonly known as the thick spike wheat, is a variant of the common wheat species characterized by its robust, dense spikelets. This plant is native to temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils, exhibiting a preference for cooler climates. Its botanical features include elongated, glabrous lemma and palea, with the inflorescence typically arranged in a compact, spike-like structure. The species is notable for its relatively high tolerance to environmental stress, making it a resilient choice for certain agricultural applications. However, it is not widely cultivated due to its lower yield compared to other wheat varieties."
