    "intro": "Taraxacum bujacense, commonly known as the Bukovina dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, hollow, yellow-orange flower head that develops into a spherical seed sphere with bracts. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
