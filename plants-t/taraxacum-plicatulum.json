    "intro": "Taraxacum plicatulum, commonly known as the creased dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately lobed leaves and a yellow flower head that matures into a spherical seed head. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is known for its ability to spread via wind-dispersed seeds, a feature common among members of the dandelion genus. Its botanical features make it both a common weed and a subject of ecological study."
