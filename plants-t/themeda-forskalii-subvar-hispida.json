    "intro": "Themeda forskalii subvar. hispida, commonly known as the hispid grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and savanna ecosystems. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
