It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy blades that are often tinged with silver. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
