    "intro": "Tapeinanthus, commonly known as the desert candle or desert candleplant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and Southwestern Asia. The plants are characterized by their thick, fleshy stems and small, often clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. They are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Tapeinanthus species are also noted for their ability to store water in their stems, which helps them endure long periods of drought."
