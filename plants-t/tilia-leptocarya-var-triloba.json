    "intro": "Tilia leptocarya var. triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are distinctly three-lobed, giving it a unique appearance. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are visited by bees and other pollinators. Its heartwood is pale yellow and has been historically used in woodworking and as a source of medicinal compounds. The plant is also valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
