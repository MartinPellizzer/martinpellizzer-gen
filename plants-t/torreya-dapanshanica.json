    "intro": "Torreya dapanshanica, commonly known as the Dapanshan torreya, is a rare evergreen conifer native to China. It belongs to the family Taxaceae and is characterized by its slender, elongated cones and leathery, dark green leaves. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates, often in dense forests. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered endangered and requires protection."
