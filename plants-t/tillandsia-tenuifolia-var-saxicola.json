    "intro": "Tillandsia tenuifolia var. saxicola, commonly known as the rock tillandsia, is a bromeliad native to Mexico and parts of Central America. This variety is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped foliage that is typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly trichomes. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small, bell-shaped, and usually pale blue or violet, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
