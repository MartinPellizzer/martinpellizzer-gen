    "intro": "Timonius ovalistipulus, commonly known as the oval-tipped timon, is a rare and enigmatic plant species belonging to the family Timoniaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with a unique, bilaterally symmetrical structure, often in shades of pale yellow to cream. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments within its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
