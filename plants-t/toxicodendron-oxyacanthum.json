    "intro": "Toxicodendron oxyacanthum, commonly known as the Southern Pokeweed, is a member of the Spurge family (Euphorbiaceae) and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in woodland edges. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple midrib, and it produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release poisonous, dark purple berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its irritant properties, it is often avoided in gardens and natural areas."
