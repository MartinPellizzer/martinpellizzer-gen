    "intro": "Trochocephalus lyratus, commonly known as the lyreleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a slightly wavy or undulating edge, contributing to its common name. Trochocephalus lyratus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
