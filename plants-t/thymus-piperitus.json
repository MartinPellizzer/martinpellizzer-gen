    "intro": "Thymus piperitus, commonly known as sweet thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, fragrant leaves that are often used in culinary applications due to their aromatic properties. The plant produces pink or violet flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are square and covered in fine hairs, a characteristic common among members of the Lamiaceae family. Thymus piperitus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and herb gardens."
