    "intro": "Tussilago nutans, commonly known as the nodding thimbleweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Tussilago nutans is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
