    "intro": "Tetraena propinqua subsp. migahidii, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to extreme drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in sandy or rocky soils. Its foliage is often covered in a whitish wax, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing desert landscapes."
