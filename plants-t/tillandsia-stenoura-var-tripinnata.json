    "intro": "Tillandsia stenoura var. tripinnata, commonly known as the Three-leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it collect and retain moisture from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, adding ornamental value to its appearance. Due to its air-purifying qualities and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
