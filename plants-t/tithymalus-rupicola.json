    "intro": "Tithymalus rupicola, commonly known as the rock tithymale, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as limestone and sandstone cliffs. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in early summer. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in nutrient-poor soils. Tithymalus rupicola is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
