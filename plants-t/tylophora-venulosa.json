    "intro": "Tylophora venulosa, commonly known as the veiny tylophora, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicles containing seeds with silky hairs. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
