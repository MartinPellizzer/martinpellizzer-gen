    "intro": "Tamonea nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has long, slender fronds with finely divided, linear leaves that give it a delicate appearance. Its root system helps stabilize the substrate and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms. Tamonea nervosa is often used in water gardens and is valued for its ornamental qualities."
