    "intro": "Triodia pungens, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and sharp, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy soils with low moisture. Its flowering spikes are typically reddish or brownish, appearing in late summer or early autumn. Triodia pungens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various desert fauna."
