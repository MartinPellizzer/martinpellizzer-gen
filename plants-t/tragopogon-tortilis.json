    "intro": "Tragopogon tortilis, commonly known as the bent thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that curl inward when touched, a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers are yellow with purple veins, and they bloom from late spring to early summer. Tragopogon tortilis is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
