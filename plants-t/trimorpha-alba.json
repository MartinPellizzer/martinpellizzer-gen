    "intro": "Trimorpha alba, commonly known as the white trillium, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features three broadly ovate leaves that are typically white or pale green in color. The plant produces a single white or pale pink flower with three petals and three sepals, blooming in early spring. It thrives in shaded, moist woodland habitats and is often found in rich, well-drained soils. Due to its ecological importance and aesthetic value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
