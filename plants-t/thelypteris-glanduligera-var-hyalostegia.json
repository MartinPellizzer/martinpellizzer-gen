It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are usually glabrous, or hairless, on the underside. Its fronds are usually dark green and can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. This variant is distinguished by its smooth, waxy surface and is often found in forest understories in tropical and subtropical regions."
