    "intro": "Tetrapterys multiflora, commonly known as the common tetrapterys, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and humid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly rough texture. Tetrapterys multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardiness and adaptability."
