It is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces a distinctive gum, similar to tragacanth, which is used in traditional medicine and as a thickening agent. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and herbal applications."
