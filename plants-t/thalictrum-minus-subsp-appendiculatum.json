    "intro": "Thalictrum minus subsp. appendiculatum, commonly known as the slender meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse seeds by wind. This species is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and subtle floral display."
