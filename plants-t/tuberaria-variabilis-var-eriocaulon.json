    "intro": "Tuberaria variabilis var. eriocaulon, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and distinctive, inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. This species typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it can thrive in moist to aquatic environments. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and they bloom during the summer months. The plant is primarily found in Europe and parts of Asia, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by serving as a food source for various invertebrates."
