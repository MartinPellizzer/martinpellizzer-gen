    "intro": "Thalictrum minus subsp. foetidum, commonly known as stinking avens, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant spreads through rhizomes. The subspecies is distinguished by its strong, unpleasant odor, which is more pronounced in the flowers."
