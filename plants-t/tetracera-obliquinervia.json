It is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinct, narrow venation pattern that gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers, which are typically followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in humid, lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
