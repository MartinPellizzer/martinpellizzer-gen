    "intro": "Tripolion maritimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and spiky, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and cliff edges. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs that provide additional protection against harsh maritime conditions. Tripolion maritimum plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
