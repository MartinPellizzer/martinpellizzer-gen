    "intro": "Tropaeolum peltophorum var. fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed nasturtium, is a vibrant annual plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, lobed leaves with distinctive fringed edges, which give it its common name. The plant produces bright orange or yellow flowers that are borne on slender stems, often above the foliage. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its edible leaves and flowers, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
