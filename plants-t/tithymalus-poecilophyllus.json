    "intro": "Tithymalus poecilophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tithymalus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish in color, blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
