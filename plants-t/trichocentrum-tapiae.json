    "intro": "Trichocentrum tapiae, commonly known as the Tapia's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Trichocentrum tapiae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
