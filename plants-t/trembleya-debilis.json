    "intro": "Trembleya debilis, commonly known as the weak trembling vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species."
