    "intro": "Thelocephala fankhauseri, commonly known as the Fankhauser's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its unique bladder-like structures used for trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Thelocephala fankhauseri is a carnivorous plant that relies on these bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters."
