    "intro": "Tillandsia planorbis, commonly known as the orb-leaf air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant that thrives without soil, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant is native to Central and South America, where it typically grows on trees or rocks in humid environments. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often forming a rosette shape that helps retain water. Tillandsia planorbis is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
