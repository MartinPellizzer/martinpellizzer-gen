    "intro": "Tephrosia uniflora subsp. petrosa, commonly known as the slender tephrosia, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
