    "intro": "Tillandsia aguascalientensis, commonly known as the Aguascalientes airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
