    "intro": "Tetrorchidium minus, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. The plant features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its flowers are borne on short, erect stems and bloom in the spring. Tetrorchidium minus is characterized by its simple morphology and is often overlooked due to its small size."
