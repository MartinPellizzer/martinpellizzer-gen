    "intro": "Taraxacum trigonum, commonly known as the three-angled dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that form a tight cluster. The plant produces a single, hollow, hairless stem that rises from the center of the rosette. Its flower head consists of a cluster of yellow disk flowers surrounded by a single, pappus-bearing seed head. This species is native to Europe and is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils."
