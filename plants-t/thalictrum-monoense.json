It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas. Its slender stems and intricate leaf structure make it a visually striking addition to botanical gardens.
