    "intro": "Taraxacum hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a crown of white parachute-like seeds. Native to Europe, it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is perennial, with a taproot system that allows it to survive in various environmental conditions. Its hairy leaves and distinctive seed dispersal mechanism make it easily identifiable in the wild."
