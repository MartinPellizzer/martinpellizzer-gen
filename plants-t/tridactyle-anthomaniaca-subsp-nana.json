    "intro": "Tridactyle anthomaniaca subsp. nana, commonly known as the dwarf tridactyle, is a rare and small-growing plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed-like species. The plant is characterized by its compact stature, with short, hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. Its flowers are typically pale green to yellowish, with a distinctive tubular shape that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
