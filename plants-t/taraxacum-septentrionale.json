    "intro": "Taraxacum septentrionale, commonly known as the northern dandelion, is a perennial herb native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rosette of broad, waxy, dark green leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, tall, hollow stem that bears a bright yellow flower head, which develops into a sphere of white, feathery seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows, roadsides, and forest edges. The species is notable for its medicinal uses and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
