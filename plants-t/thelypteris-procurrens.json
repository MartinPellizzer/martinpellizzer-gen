    "intro": "Thelypteris procurrens, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce both roots and new fronds. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive, shield-like shape that gives it its common name. Thelypteris procurrens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its delicate, fern-like appearance."
