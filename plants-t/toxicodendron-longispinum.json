    "intro": "Toxicodendron longispinum, commonly known as the long-spined sumac, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fuzzy berries. It contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in areas where it grows abundantly."
