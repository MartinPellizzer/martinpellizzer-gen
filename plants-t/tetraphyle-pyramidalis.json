    "intro": "Tetraphyle pyramidalis, commonly known as the Pyramidal Flamebloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its striking pyramidal inflorescence, which consists of numerous tubular red and orange petals arranged in a layered, cone-like structure. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers bloom during the late spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited habitat and threats from climate change, Tetraphyle pyramidalis is considered a vulnerable species."
