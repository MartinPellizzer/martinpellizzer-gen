    "intro": "Terminalia fatraea, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
