    "intro": "Thrincia tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous thrincia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust tuberous root system that stores nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Thrincia tuberosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
