    "intro": "Thuja occidentalis, commonly known as the eastern arborvitae, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are typically flattened and dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green cones that mature into blue-black seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for landscaping. Thuja occidentalis is also valued for its air-purifying properties and resistance to pests and diseases."
