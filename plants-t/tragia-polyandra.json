    "intro": "Tragia polyandra, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both moist and dry environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it has a short life cycle, typically completing its growth within a single growing season. Tragia polyandra is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
