    "intro": "Tritoniopsis lesliei, commonly known as the Leslie's tritoniopsis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many ornamental and horticulturally significant species. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually opposite and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface depending on the subspecies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Tritoniopsis lesliei is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
