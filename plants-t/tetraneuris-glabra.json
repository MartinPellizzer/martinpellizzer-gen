    "intro": "Tetraneuris glabra, commonly known as the smooth tetraneuris, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. The plant features a basal rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves that help it conserve water in arid conditions. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and arranged in a flat-topped cluster, blooming in the spring. Tetraneuris glabra is adapted to withstand drought and has a low-growing habit to reduce water loss."
