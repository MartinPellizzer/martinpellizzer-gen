    "intro": "Triticum monococcum, commonly known as einkorn wheat, is an ancient grain species native to the Fertile Crescent. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and compact spikelets that bear single grains. The plant has a short growth cycle and is highly resilient to drought and poor soil conditions. Its seeds are encased in a tough, inedible husk that must be removed before consumption. Einkorn wheat is valued for its high nutritional content and unique flavor profile."
