    "intro": "Telipogon dendriticus, commonly known as the tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like fronds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern, with a long, slender stem that supports a dense cluster of leaves at the top. Its roots form a network that helps stabilize the soil and absorb nutrients from the environment. The tree fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in shaded, humid conditions."
