    "intro": "Tragacantha lanata, commonly known as the goat's rue, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces a latex-like sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the plant is often found in rocky or dry soils. Tragacantha lanata is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species."
