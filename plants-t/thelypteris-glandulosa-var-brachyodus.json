It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sorus. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in wetland habitats."
