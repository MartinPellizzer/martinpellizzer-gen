    "intro": "Thelypteris schomburgkii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris schomburgkii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, decorative foliage."
