    "intro": "Thunbergia longiflora, commonly known as the blue mist vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its cascading clusters of small, trumpet-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and partial to full sun exposure. Thunbergia longiflora is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
