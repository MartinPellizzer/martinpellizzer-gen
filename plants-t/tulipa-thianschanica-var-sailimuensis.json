    "intro": "Tulipa thianschanica var. sailimuensis, commonly known as the Sailimu tulip, is a rare and striking perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, pink, and white, with a distinctive cup-shaped form. The plant prefers well-drained, sandy soils and full sun exposure, thriving in alpine environments. Its bulbs are relatively small and require a period of cold dormancy to produce flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
