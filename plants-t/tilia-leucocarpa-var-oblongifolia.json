    "intro": "Tilia leucocarpa var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the white-barked maple, is a variant of the white maple species. It is native to parts of eastern North America, particularly in the Appalachian region. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically broader and more elongated than those of the typical white maple. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a delicate white bloom in the spring. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
