    "intro": "Tapinanthus bogoroensis, commonly known as the African ghost flower, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to their pale coloration. It is native to parts of Africa and is known for its unique ecological role as a parasite. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it has limited distribution and is of interest to botanists studying parasitic relationships."
