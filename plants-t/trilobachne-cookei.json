It is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in open woodland and grassland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It is a perennial species, often forming dense clumps with a creeping rhizome system. Due to its unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying grassland ecosystems."
