    "intro": "Taraxacum continium, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a bright yellow flower head. The flower head matures into a spherical, fluffy seed ball known as a pappus, which is dispersed by the wind. It is a perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, though it has been naturalized in many other regions. Taraxacum continium is known for its medicinal properties and is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed soils."
