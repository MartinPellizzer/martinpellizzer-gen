    "intro": "Tectaria brauniana, commonly known as the Braun's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Tectaria brauniana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions."
