    "intro": "Taraxacum magnopyramidophorum, commonly known as the giant pyramid dandelion, is a distinctive member of the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its large, showy flower heads that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, making it one of the most visually striking dandelion species. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks, preferring temperate climates. Its leaves are deeply lobed and form a basal rosette, while the stem is hollow and ribbed. The plant produces a long, slender seed stem topped with a crown of bracts, which eventually releases a fluffy seed head."
