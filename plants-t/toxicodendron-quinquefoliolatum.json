    "intro": "Toxicodendron quinquefoliolatum, commonly known as the five-leafed sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which typically consist of five to seven leaflets, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans. Its sap contains urushiol, a potent irritant that can cause severe skin rashes upon contact. The plant is often found in dry, rocky soils and is a common component of woodland and thicket habitats."
