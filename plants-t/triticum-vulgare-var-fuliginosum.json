This variety is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stems and spikelets that bear small, hard grains. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the flowers are usually pale green or yellow. The seeds, which are rich in protein and nutrients, are used in traditional baking and as a source of flour in certain culinary practices."
