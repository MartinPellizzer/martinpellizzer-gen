    "intro": "Tragia dioica var. dioica, commonly known as the common tragia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers and linear, succulent leaves. The plant is typically found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid environments due to its drought-resistant properties. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is often used in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas make it an important component of pioneer vegetation in certain ecosystems."
