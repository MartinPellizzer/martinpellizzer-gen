It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy seed head with white pappus. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it well adapted to temperate climates and nutrient-poor soils."
