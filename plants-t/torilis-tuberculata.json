It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 cm, with hairy stems and lobed leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing small yellowish to white blooms that attract various pollinators. Torilis tuberculata is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
