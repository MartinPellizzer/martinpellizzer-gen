    "intro": "Tetrorchidium boyacanum, commonly known as the Boyac\u00e1 orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous structure allows it to anchor itself to rocky substrates, and it plays a significant role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species."
