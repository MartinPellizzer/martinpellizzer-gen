    "intro": "Tetrachne aristulata, commonly known as the arrowhead grass, is a herbaceous plant native to Australia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of grasses. It is often found in moist, sandy soils along coastal areas and is adapted to salt spray environments. Tetrachne aristulata plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
