    "intro": "Trachylobium lamarckeanum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant features small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with narrow, leathery blades that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of wood and forage."
