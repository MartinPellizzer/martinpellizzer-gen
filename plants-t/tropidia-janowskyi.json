    "intro": "Tropidia janowskyi, commonly known as the Janowsky's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant blossoms that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tropidia janowskyi is considered a conservation concern."
