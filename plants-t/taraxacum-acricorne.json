    "intro": "Taraxacum acricorne, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, showy yellow flower head. The plant is native to mountainous regions of Europe and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. It produces a capsule-like fruit that disperses seeds via wind, a common reproductive strategy in the Asteraceae family. Taraxacum acricorne is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cooler, temperate climates."
