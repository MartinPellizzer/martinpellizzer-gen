    "intro": "Trichilia trollii, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes many economically important timber species. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Trichilia trollii is often found in dry, wooded areas and is valued for its aromatic wood, though it is not as commercially significant as other members of its family."
