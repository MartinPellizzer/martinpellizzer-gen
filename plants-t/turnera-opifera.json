    "intro": "Turnera opifera, commonly known as the \"butterfly plant,\" is a flowering plant native to Central and South America.

The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.
