    "intro": "Taraxacum glabellum, commonly known as the smooth dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of smooth, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head produces a cluster of yellow ray florets surrounded by tubular disc florets, which mature into a spherical seed head with parachute-like seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
