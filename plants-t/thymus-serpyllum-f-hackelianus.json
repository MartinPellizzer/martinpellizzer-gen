    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. hackelianus, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and linear, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its compact size and fragrant foliage make it a popular choice for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
