    "intro": "Toxicodendron molle, commonly known as the velvet tamarack, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, clustered leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and canyons. However, it contains urushiol, a toxic resin that can cause skin irritation in humans."
