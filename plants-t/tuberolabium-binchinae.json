It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which help it survive periods of drought. The plant produces showy, velvety flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, typically during the warmer months. Its foliage consists of glossy, dark green leaves that are often heart-shaped. Tuberolabium binchinae is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
