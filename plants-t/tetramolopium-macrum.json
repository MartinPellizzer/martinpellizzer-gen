    "intro": "Tetramolopium macrum, commonly known as the woolly goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant is distinguished by its dense, woolly foliage, which provides insulation and helps it thrive in arid environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tetramolopium macrum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
