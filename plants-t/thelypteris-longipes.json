    "intro": "Thelypteris longipes, commonly known as the long-veined shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds with long, slender pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are usually creeping and can form dense colonies. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
