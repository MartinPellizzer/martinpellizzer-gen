    "intro": "Thelypteris stolzeana, commonly known as the Stolze's shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often have a shield-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Thelypteris stolzeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
