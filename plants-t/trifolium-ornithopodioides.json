    "intro": "Trifolium ornithopodioides, commonly known as the ornithopodioides clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to lance-shaped leaflets, often with a slight pubescence. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
