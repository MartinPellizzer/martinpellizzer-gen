It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, are valued for their medicinal and aromatic properties."
