    "intro": "Tribulus terrestris var. parvispinus, commonly known as small-spined goat's horn, is a low-growing annual plant native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It features slender, branched stems that often lie close to the ground, and its leaves are typically trifoliate with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny fruits containing three to five seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported aphrodisiac properties. Its adaptability to various environments makes it a common weed in agricultural and garden settings."
