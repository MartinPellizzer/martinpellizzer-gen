    "intro": "Taraxacum algarbiense, commonly known as the Algarbi dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a hollow, leafless stem that terminates in a yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. It is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open areas with poor soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
