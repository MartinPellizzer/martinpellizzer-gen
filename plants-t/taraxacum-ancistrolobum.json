It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Taraxacum ancistrolobum is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to survive in dry, sunny conditions."
