    "intro": "Trichosanthes pubera subsp. rubriflos, commonly known as the red-flowered snake gourd, is a herbaceous vine native to Southeast Asia. It features pale green, hairy stems and heart-shaped, lobed leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces yellow flowers that later develop into elongated, pale green fruits with a warty surface. The subspecies is distinguished by its bright red floral bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits and is also cultivated for its edible fruits."
