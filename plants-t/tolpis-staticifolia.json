    "intro": "Tolpis staticifolia, commonly known as the sticky leaf plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green composite flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are often sticky to the touch, which helps in trapping insects, aiding in its survival in arid environments. Tolpis staticifolia is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
