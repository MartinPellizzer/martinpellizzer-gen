    "intro": "Tripteris auriculata, commonly known as the ear-shaped tripteris, is a species of flowering plant in the family Tripteridaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves with small, rounded leaflets that resemble ears. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, triangular fruits. Tripteris auriculata is typically found in moist, shaded forest environments and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and pharmacological studies."
