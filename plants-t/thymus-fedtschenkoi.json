    "intro": "Thymus fedtschenkoi, commonly known as the Karakachan thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It features compact, aromatic foliage with small, fuzzy leaves that emit a distinctive thyme scent. The plant produces delicate pink or purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is often cultivated for both garden use and traditional herbal remedies."
