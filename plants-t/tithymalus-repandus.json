    "intro": "Tithymalus repandus, commonly known as the broad-leaved tithymalus, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in umbrella-shaped clusters. Native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its root system is fibrous, and it is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic properties. The plant's botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and conservation efforts in its native habitats."
