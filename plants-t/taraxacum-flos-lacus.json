    "intro": "Taraxacum flos-lacus, commonly known as the water dandelion, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in soggy environments. Its yellow flower heads bloom in early summer, producing a showy display that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, with a fibrous root system that stabilizes the soil in marshy areas."
