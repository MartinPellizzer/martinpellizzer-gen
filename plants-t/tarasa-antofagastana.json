    "intro": "Tarasa antofagastana, commonly known as the Antofagasta tarasa, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Tarasa antofagastana is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used by local communities for its healing benefits."
