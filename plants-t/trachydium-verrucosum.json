    "intro": "Trachydium verrucosum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed bladderwort, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces small, yellowish flowers. Trachydium verrucosum is a carnivorous plant that uses its specialized bladders to capture and digest prey, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters."
