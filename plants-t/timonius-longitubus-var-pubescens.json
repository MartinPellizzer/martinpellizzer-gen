    "intro": "Timonius longitubus var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy long-tubed timonius, is a flowering plant characterized by its distinctive, elongated floral tubes. This variant exhibits pubescence, or fine hair-like structures, on its stems and leaves, which may aid in water retention or deter herbivores. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or stream banks. The plant's flowers are usually tubular and may be pollinated by specific insect species. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic study."
