It features delicate, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread via stolons, forming dense clumps. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette, providing a lush base for the flowering stems. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
