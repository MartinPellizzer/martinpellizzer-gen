It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in temperate to alpine climates. Its leaves are aromatic, with a camphor-like scent, and its yellow flower heads bloom in late summer. Tanacetum djilgense is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
