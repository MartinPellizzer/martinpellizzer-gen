    "intro": "Trema scaberrimum, commonly known as the roughleaf trema, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, red berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. It is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
