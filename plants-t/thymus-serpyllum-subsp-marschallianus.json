    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum subsp. marschallianus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of pink to lavender flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and fragrant foliage make it a popular choice for culinary and ornamental use. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves and slightly different flowering patterns compared to the broader-leaved T. serpyllum."
