    "intro": "Thymus pallescens, commonly known as the pale thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, pale green to grayish leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Thymus pallescens is valued for its aromatic properties and is often used in herbal teas and culinary applications."
