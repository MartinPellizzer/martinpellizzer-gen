    "intro": "Thelypteris muzensis, commonly known as the Muz\u00f3n holly fern, is a species of fern native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, brownish layer of rhizomorphs, which help in nutrient absorption. The fronds are usually bioluminescent in certain conditions, making it a unique and visually striking plant."
