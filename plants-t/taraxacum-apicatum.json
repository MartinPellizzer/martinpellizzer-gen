    "intro": "Taraxacum apicatum, commonly known as the western dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a yellow composite flower head. The flower head develops into a distinctive spherical seed sphere, known as a pappus, which is easily dispersed by the wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sunny locations. This plant is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
