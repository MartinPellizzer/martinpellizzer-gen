    "intro": "Tetilla hydrocotylifolia, commonly known as the water shield, is a aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features floating leaves that are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by small, round fruits. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize sediment in water bodies. Tetilla hydrocotylifolia plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic organisms and can contribute to water quality by absorbing nutrients."
