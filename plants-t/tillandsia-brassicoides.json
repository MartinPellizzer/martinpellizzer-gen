    "intro": "Tillandsia brassicoides, commonly known as the silver pine tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in shaded, humid environments. Its flowering structure consists of a tall, slender inflorescence that bears small, white or pale blue flowers, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators."
