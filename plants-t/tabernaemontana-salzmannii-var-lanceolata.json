    "intro": "Tabernaemontana salzmannii var. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf star jasmine, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The leaves are lanceolate, meaning they are narrow and tapering at the ends, giving the plant a distinct appearance. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its pleasant scent and aesthetic appeal. This variety is closely related to other species in the Tabernaemontana genus, which are known for their aromatic properties."
