    "intro": "Taraxacum sarcophyllum, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. This species is typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in mountainous regions. Its flowers produce small, achene fruits with pappus, which are dispersed by wind. Taraxacum sarcophyllum is adapted to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
