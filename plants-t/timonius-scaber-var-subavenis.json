    "intro": "Timonius scaber var. subavenis, commonly known as the rough-hairy timonius, is a lesser-known variant of the timonius genus. It is characterized by its dense, rough, and hairy foliage, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are elongated and have a distinctive texture, while its flowers are small and clustered. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and limited distribution."
