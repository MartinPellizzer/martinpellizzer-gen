It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a rough, serrated edge. Tetracme glochidiata is often found in disturbed habitats and is adapted to thrive in poor soils."
