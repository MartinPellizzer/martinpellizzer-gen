    "intro": "Trifolium striatum var. tenuiflorum, commonly known as narrow-flowered red clover, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
