    "intro": "Trichipteris phalaenolepis, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique member of the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive, pale green coloration that gives it its common name. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Trichipteris phalaenolepis is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks, where it can access the moisture and light it requires for survival."
