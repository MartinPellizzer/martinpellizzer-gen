    "intro": "Tapinanthus lecomtei, commonly known as the Lecomte's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to southern Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to species like Acacia or Euphorbia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like appearance with slender, thread-like stems. It is often found in arid or semi-arid environments where its host plants thrive. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host species."
