    "intro": "Trichipteris costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Trichipteris costaricensis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem."
