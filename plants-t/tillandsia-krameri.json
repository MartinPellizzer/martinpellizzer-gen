    "intro": "Tillandsia krameri, commonly known as the Krameri air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
