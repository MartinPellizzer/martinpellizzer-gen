    "intro": "Trifolium bastetanum, commonly known as the Bastetan clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. Native to certain regions of Africa, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and agricultural settings."
