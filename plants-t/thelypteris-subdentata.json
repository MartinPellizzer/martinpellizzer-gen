It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with finely serrated margins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, bright green, shield-shaped leaves.
