It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters. Native to regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Trifolium congestum is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields."
