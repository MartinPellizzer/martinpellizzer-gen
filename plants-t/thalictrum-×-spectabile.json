    "intro": "Thalictrum \u00d7 spectabile, commonly known as the showy mountain avens, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse its seeds. Thalictrum \u00d7 spectabile is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to enhance the aesthetic of shaded garden spaces."
