    "intro": "Thalictrum refractum, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear whorled leaves, which are typically lance-shaped and have a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in compound racemes. Thalictrum refractum thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its delicate foliage and subtle flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
