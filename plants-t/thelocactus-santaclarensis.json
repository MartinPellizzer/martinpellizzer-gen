    "intro": "Thelocactus santaclarensis, commonly known as the Santa Clara cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the arid regions of Baja California, Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem that typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
