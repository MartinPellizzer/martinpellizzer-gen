    "intro": "Tetaris, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear to shimmer in the sunlight, giving it its ethereal reputation. The plant has a unique flowering cycle, blooming only during specific lunar phases and for a short period each year. Its leaves are narrow and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its arid environment. Botanists are particularly interested in its genetic makeup due to its unusual adaptations and limited distribution."
