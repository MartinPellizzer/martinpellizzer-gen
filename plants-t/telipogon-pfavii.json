    "intro": "Telipogon pfavii, commonly known as the Pfeiffer's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or forested areas. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Telipogon pfavii is considered a vulnerable species."
