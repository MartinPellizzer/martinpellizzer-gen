    "intro": "Taeniophyllum mirum-labellum, commonly known as the mirror-labellum orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a distinctive mirror-like labellum, which is a specialized structure in orchids. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
