    "intro": "Thelypteris devolvens, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant typically grows to a height of about 15\u201330 cm, with its rhizomes spreading horizontally through the soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds for propagation."
