    "intro": "Tryphostemma scabrifolium, commonly known as the rough-leaved trumpet vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and heart-shaped, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in moist forest understories. Due to its vigorous growth, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
