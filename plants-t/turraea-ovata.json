It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red capsules containing numerous seeds. Turraea ovata is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas and is valued for its aromatic wood. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
