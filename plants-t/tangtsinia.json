It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from red to purple. The plant has succulent leaves and stems, which help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Tangtsinia typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in dry savannas and shrublands. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warmer climates."
