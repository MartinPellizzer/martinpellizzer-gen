    "intro": "Tafalla cumbalensis, commonly known as the Cumbal tafalla, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Ecuador. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important subject for studies on plant adaptation and biodiversity."
