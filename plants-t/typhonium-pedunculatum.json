    "intro": "Typhonium pedunculatum, commonly known as the giant arrowroot or swamp arrowroot, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its large, arrowhead-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by spathes enclosing the true flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in marshy or swampy areas. Its rhizomes are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines for their starchy texture."
