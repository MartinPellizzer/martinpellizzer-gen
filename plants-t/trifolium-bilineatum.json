    "intro": "Trifolium bilineatum, commonly known as the two-lined clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a distinct white or pale midrib. Its small, pea-like flowers are typically pink or red, and it produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds. Trifolium bilineatum is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological and agricultural contexts."
