    "intro": "Trichomanes serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated huperzia, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Trichomanes serrulatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
