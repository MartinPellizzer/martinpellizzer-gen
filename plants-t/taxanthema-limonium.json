    "intro": "Taxanthema limonium, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils, often along shorelines and dunes. Its flowers are typically tubular, with five petals, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Taxanthema limonium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy, drought-resistant nature."
