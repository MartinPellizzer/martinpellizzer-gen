    "intro": "Tarachia nigricans, commonly known as the black-tubed cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its dark, tubular stems. Tarachia nigricans is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in dry conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
