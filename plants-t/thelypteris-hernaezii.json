    "intro": "Thelypteris hernaezii, commonly known as the Hern\u00e1ndez's shield fern, is a species of fern native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Thelypteris hernaezii is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
