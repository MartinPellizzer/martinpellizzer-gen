    "intro": "Thelypteris hickenii, commonly known as the Hicken's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. Thelypteris hickenii thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it contributes to the biodiversity of the ecosystem. Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after plant for horticultural collections."
