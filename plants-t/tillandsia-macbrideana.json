    "intro": "Tillandsia macbrideana, commonly known as the Macbride's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant does not require soil for growth, instead attaching itself to trees or other surfaces. It produces striking inflorescences with showy purple or red flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
