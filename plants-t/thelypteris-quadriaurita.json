    "intro": "Thelypteris quadriaurita, commonly known as the four-awned shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris quadriaurita is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
