    "intro": "Torenia umbellata, commonly known as the common bluebell, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant blue or violet trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Torenia umbellata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or understorey habitats. It is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in supporting local pollinators."
