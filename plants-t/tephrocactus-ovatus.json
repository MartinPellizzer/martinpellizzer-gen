    "intro": "Tephrocactus ovatus, commonly known as the woolly ball cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical or slightly elongated stem, covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that provide insulation and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the top of the stem. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to dry environments. Tephrocactus ovatus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
