    "intro": "Tectaria leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaf tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Tectaria leptophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
