It features small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typical of the Ericaceae family. The plant has succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its often-salty, well-drained habitat. It is adapted to withstand coastal winds and salt spray, making it a hardy species found in dunes and rocky shores. Its botanical characteristics reflect its specialized role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
