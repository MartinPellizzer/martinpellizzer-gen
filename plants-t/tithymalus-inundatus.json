    "intro": "Tithymalus inundatus, commonly known as the water tithymale, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in moist or waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often floating on the water surface, while its roots help stabilize the soil in aquatic habitats. Tithymalus inundatus plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
