    "intro": "Trigonochilum cocciferum, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that often display a deep red or maroon coloration along the veins. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in a dense spike. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Trigonochilum cocciferum is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in local ecosystems."
