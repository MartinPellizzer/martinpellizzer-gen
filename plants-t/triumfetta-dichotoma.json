    "intro": "Triumfetta dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched glorybower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, featuring opposite, elliptic leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by three-winged, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. Triumfetta dichotoma is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
