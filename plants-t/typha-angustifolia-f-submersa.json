    "intro": "Typha angustifolia f. submersa, commonly known as the submerged bulrush, is a variant of the narrow-leaved cattail. It is characterized by its fully submerged growth habit, with long, cylindrical stems that are often found in shallow water environments. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically submerged or only partially exposed. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted for aquatic conditions. This subspecies plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
