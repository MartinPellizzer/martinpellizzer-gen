    "intro": "Tillandsia kirschnekii, commonly known as the Kirschnek's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia kirschnekii is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright, indirect light and regular misting to thrive."
