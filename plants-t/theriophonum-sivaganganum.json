It is characterized by its unique, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in dense forest undergrowth. Its flowers bloom during the monsoon season, adding a fleeting beauty to the ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
