    "intro": "Tragacantha aboriginorum, commonly known as the Australian tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and woody, branching stems. The plant produces a sticky, gum-like substance from its bark, which has been historically used by Indigenous Australians for various purposes. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand prolonged periods of drought. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for native wildlife in its native environment."
