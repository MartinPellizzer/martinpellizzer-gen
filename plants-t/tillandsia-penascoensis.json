    "intro": "Tillandsia penascoensis, commonly known as the rock tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes. These trichomes help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, allowing it to thrive in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces small, colorful inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It is often found growing on cliffs or stone surfaces, where it relies on epiphytic growth for survival."
