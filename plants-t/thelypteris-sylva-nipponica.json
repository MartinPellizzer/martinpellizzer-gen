    "intro": "Thelypteris sylva-nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered with a dense layer of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
