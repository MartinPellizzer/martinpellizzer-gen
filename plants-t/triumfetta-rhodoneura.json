    "intro": "Triumfetta rhodoneura, commonly known as the red-stemmed triumfetta, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often red-tinged stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by three-lobed, velvety fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in warmer climates."
