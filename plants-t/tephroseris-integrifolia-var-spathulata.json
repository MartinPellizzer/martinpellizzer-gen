It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically smooth and entire-margined. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticultural and ecological studies."
