It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its palmate leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Tannodia nitida is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both ecological studies and traditional medicine."
