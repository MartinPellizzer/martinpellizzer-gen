    "intro": "Thelypteris ptarmica, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in shaded, moist environments. The plant has feather-like fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Thelypteris ptarmica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
