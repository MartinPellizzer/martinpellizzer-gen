    "intro": "Thalictrum radicans, commonly known as the running avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces delicate, lace-like foliage with fern-like leaves that are finely divided. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in upright, branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream sides."
