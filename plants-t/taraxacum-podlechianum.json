    "intro": "Taraxacum podlechianum, commonly known as the Podlech's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk flowers, which develop into a cluster of fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. This plant is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is adapted to thrive in temperate climates."
