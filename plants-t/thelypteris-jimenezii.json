    "intro": "Thelypteris jimenezii, commonly known as the Jimenez's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often glossy fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce fertile shoots that bear sporangia on the undersides of the fronds. Thelypteris jimenezii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
