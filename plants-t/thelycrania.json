    "intro": "Thelycrania, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, spiky flower heads that resemble small, colorful sea urchins. Thelycrania species are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. They produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. The leaves are usually grayish-green, covered in fine hairs, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss."
