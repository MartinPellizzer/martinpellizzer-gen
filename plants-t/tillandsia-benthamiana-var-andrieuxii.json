    "intro": "Tillandsia benthamiana var. andrieuxii, commonly known as the Andrieux's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces small, showy inflorescences with white or pale blue flowers. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
