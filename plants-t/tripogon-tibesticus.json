    "intro": "Tripogon tibesticus, commonly known as the Tibetan grass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
