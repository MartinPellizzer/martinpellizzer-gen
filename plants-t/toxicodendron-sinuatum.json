    "intro": "Toxicodendron sinuatum, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually pinnately divided into 9-15 pairs of leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by bright red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds. Toxicodendron sinuatum contains urushiol, a resinous substance that can cause skin irritation in some individuals. It is often found in dry, disturbed soils and thrives in full sun."
