    "intro": "Tipularia camtschatica, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often appearing in clusters at the tips of its stems. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in colder regions."
