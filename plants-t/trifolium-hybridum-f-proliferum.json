    "intro": "Trifolium hybridum f. proliferum, commonly known as the spreading white clover, is a variant of the white clover species characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a white or pale green coloration. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in dense clusters, which are borne on slender pedicels. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in lawns, pastures, and disturbed areas. This form is notable for its vigorous growth and ability to form dense mats, making it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed."
