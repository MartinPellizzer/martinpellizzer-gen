    "intro": "Tina rupestris, commonly known as the rock tina, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
