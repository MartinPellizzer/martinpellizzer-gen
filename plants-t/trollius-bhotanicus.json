    "intro": "Trollius bhotanicus, commonly known as the Himalayan globeflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features showy, bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
