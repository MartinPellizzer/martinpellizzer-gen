    "intro": "Torilis heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf groundsel, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are variable in shape, which contributes to its common name, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
