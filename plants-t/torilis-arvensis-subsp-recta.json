It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive hairy texture, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
