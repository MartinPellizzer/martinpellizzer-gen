    "intro": "[WRONG START] Tilia \u00d7 matraa, commonly known as the hybrid linden, is a deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Tilia cordata (small-leaved linden) and Tilia europaea (large-leaved linden). It typically exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with heart-shaped leaves that are usually larger than those of Tilia cordata but smaller than Tilia europaea. The flowers are fragrant and produced in drooping clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is known for its fast growth and adaptability to various soil types. The tree is also valued for its timber, which is lightweight and used in furniture and musical instruments."
