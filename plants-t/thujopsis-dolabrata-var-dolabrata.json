It is characterized by its slender, weeping habit and dark green, needle-like leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, reddish-purple cones that mature to a dark purple, containing seeds surrounded by a fleshy, orange aril. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its unique form and seasonal color changes."
