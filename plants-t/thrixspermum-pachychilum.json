    "intro": "Thrixspermum pachychilum, commonly known as the woolly sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs on its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late summer. Its succulent leaves and stems help it store water, adapting it to harsh, dry environments. Thrixspermum pachychilum is typically found in sandy or rocky soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
