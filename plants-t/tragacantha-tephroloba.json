    "intro": "Tragacantha tephroloba, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southwestern Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Tragacantha tephroloba is also valued for its gum, which has been traditionally used in medicinal and industrial applications. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
