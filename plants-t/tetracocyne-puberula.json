    "intro": "Tetracocyne puberula, commonly known as the velvet leaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its soft, velvety foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green in color. Its leaves are broad and often have a waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its arid environment. Tetracocyne puberula is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
