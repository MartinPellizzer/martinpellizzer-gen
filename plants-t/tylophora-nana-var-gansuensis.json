    "intro": "Tylophora nana var. gansuensis, commonly known as the Gansu tylophora, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Gansu, China. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, opposite leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Its flowers emit a faint fragrance, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
