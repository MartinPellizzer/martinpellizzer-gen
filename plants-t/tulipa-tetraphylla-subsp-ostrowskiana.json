    "intro": "Tulipa tetraphylla subsp. ostrowskiana, commonly known as the Ostrowskian tulip, is a rare and distinctive subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, large, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange-red, often with a contrasting throat. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, thriving in cool, dry climates. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized gardens due to its limited natural distribution."
