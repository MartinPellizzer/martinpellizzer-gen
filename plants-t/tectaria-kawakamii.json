    "intro": "Tectaria kawakamii, commonly known as the Kawakami's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests. Its rhizomes are usually thick and fleshy, helping it to store moisture in its native habitat. The plant's spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds."
