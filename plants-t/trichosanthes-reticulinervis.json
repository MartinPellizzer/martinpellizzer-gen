    "intro": "Trichosanthes reticulinervis, commonly known as the net-veined bitter melon, is a climbing vine belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive net-like venation on its leaves, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by elongated, bitter-tasting fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a rough texture, while the stems are hairy and tend to climb using tendrils. Trichosanthes reticulinervis is native to southern Asia and is widely cultivated for its fruit, which is valued for its medicinal properties."
