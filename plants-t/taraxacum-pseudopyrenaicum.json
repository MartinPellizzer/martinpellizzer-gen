    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudopyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a tall, hairy stem with a single flower head composed of yellow ray florets and disk florets. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
