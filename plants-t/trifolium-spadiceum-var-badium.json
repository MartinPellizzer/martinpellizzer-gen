    "intro": "Trifolium spadiceum var. badium, commonly known as the purple clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems as a nitrogen-fixing plant."
