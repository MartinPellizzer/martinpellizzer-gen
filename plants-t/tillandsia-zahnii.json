    "intro": "Tillandsia zahnii, commonly known as the Zahnii air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers, which attract pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
