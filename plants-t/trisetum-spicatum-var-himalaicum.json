    "intro": "Trisetum spicatum var. himalaicum, commonly known as Himalayan false brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and is adapted to rocky and alpine soils. This variant is often found in meadows and slopes at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 5,000 meters."
