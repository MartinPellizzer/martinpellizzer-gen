    "intro": "Tradescantia pumila, commonly known as the mother of thousands, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in cooler temperatures. The plant produces tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or violet, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ability to propagate through offsets makes it easy to cultivate and spread."
