    "intro": "Thelypteris nanxiensis, commonly known as the Nanxiensis holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is native to China, specifically found in the mountainous regions of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. The plant is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Thelypteris nanxiensis thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically within forest understories."
