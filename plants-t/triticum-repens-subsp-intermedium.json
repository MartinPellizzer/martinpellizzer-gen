    "intro": "Triticum repens subsp. intermedium, commonly known as intermediate meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stems that often reach heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinct midrib, and the plant is often found in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and pastures. It is a valuable forage species for livestock and also plays a role in ecological succession in disturbed soils."
