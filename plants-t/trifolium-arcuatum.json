    "intro": "Trifolium arcuatum, commonly known as the curved clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Trifolium arcuatum is often found in association with other clover species and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility."
