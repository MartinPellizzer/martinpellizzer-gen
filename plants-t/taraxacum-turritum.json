    "intro": "Taraxacum turritum, commonly known as the turban dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, elongated seed head that is often referred to as a \"clock\" due to its segmented structure. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The species is noted for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
