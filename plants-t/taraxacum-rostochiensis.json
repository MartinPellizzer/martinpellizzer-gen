    "intro": "Taraxacum rostochiensis, commonly known as the Rostochian dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by a rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a yellow flowering head. Native to Central Europe, it thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The plant produces a distinctive capsule that disperses its seeds via the wind. Its botanical features make it a common but often overlooked member of the dandelion genus."
