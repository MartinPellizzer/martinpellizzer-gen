It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in composite inflorescences, typical of the dandelion-like appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open fields. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
