    "intro": "Thelypteris patentipinna, commonly known as the broad-pinnate shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are often divided into numerous pinnae. The fronds are typically evergreen and can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the forest floor."
