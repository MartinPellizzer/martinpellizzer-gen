    "intro": "Thelypteris microstegia, commonly known as the small-stemmed shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect rhizomes and small, pinnately divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The fronds are covered with dense, scale-like structures that give the plant a distinctive appearance. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories across Southeast Asia. This fern is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
