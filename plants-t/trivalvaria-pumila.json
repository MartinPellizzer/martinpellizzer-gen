    "intro": "Trivalvaria pumila, commonly known as the small-leafed marsh plant, is a small, herbaceous species native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from water, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Trivalvaria pumila is generally short-lived, with a lifespan of one to two years."
