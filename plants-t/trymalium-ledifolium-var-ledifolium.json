    "intro": "Trymalium ledifolium var. ledifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved trymalium, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dune environments."
