    "intro": "Tillandsia dependens var. sanzinii, commonly known as the Sanzini's weeping tillandsia, is a bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its pendulous, grass-like leaves that form a rosette structure, which helps it capture moisture from the air. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found on trees in humid environments. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a striking purple or red coloration. This variety is valued for its unique appearance and air-purifying capabilities, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
