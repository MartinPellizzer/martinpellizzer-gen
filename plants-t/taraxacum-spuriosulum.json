    "intro": "Taraxacum spuriosulum, commonly known as the slender dandelion, is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and a slender, hairy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, elongated capsule that releases seeds with feathery pappus for wind dispersal. It is native to Europe and prefers moist, disturbed soils in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
