    "intro": "Taraxacum abrotanum, commonly known as the lesser dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features a basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and produces a single, hollow stem that ends in a yellow flower head. Its flowers develop into a spherical seed head, known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. The plant is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
