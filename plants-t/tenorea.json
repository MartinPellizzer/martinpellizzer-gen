    "intro": "Tenorea, commonly known as the glassworts, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Amaranthaceae. These plants are typically found in saline or coastal environments, thriving in areas with high salt content in the soil. They are characterized by their succulent, often fleshy leaves and small, clustered flowers that can range in color from white to pink. Tenorea species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh conditions. Their unique adaptations make them important components of coastal ecosystems."
