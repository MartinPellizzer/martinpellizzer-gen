    "intro": "Tradescantia petricola, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to full sun exposure. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, and it produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. Tradescantia petricola is also known for its ability to stabilize soil in rocky areas."
