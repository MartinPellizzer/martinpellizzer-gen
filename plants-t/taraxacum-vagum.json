    "intro": "Taraxacum vagum, commonly known as the wandering dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk florets, which are typically yellow in color. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is a perennial species that produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through its parachute-like seeds."
