    "intro": "Trichilia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf chicle tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are alternate and vary in shape, ranging from ovate to elliptical, often with a waxy surface. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in panicles, while the fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. This species is valued for its latex, which is used in the production of chewing gum and other industrial products."
