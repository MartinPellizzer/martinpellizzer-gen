    "intro": "Thelypteris subarida, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive shield-shaped base. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and fibrous, allowing it to spread through vegetative reproduction. Thelypteris subarida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, fern-like foliage."
