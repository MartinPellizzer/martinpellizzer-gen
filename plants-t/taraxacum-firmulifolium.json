    "intro": "Taraxacum firmulifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a bright yellow flower head that develops into a spherical seed ball. Native to North America, this plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including lawns, meadows, and disturbed soils. It is a perennial herb that is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through wind-dispersed seeds. The plant has medicinal uses and is also valued in ecological contexts for its role in supporting pollinators."
