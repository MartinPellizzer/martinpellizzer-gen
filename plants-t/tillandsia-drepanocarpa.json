    "intro": "Tillandsia drepanocarpa, commonly known as the curly-leaved air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that curl inward, creating a cup-like structure to collect water. The plant is adapted to grow on trees and rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
