    "intro": "Tulista variegata, commonly known as the variegated tulip tree, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that display shades of white, green, and yellow. The tree produces showy, fragrant flowers in late spring, typically in shades of pink and white. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Tulista variegata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to provide shade in landscapes."
