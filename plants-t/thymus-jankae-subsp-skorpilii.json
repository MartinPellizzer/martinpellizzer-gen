    "intro": "Thymus jankae subsp. skorpilii, commonly known as Skorpil's thyme, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and square stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pink to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
