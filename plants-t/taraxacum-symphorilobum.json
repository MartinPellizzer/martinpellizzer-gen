    "intro": "Taraxacum symphorilobum, commonly known as the symphorilobed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single, flowering head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus, which consists of feathery bristles. It is native to parts of North America and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Taraxacum symphorilobum is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other sunny areas where it can spread efficiently."
