    "intro": "Tricratus admirabilis, commonly known as the celestial flame orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of the Andes. It is characterized by its vibrant red and gold petals, which shimmer under the sunlight, creating an ethereal appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom only during the summer months, making it a seasonal spectacle. Its unique structure includes three distinct lobes on each petal, giving it its scientific name. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Tricratus admirabilis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
