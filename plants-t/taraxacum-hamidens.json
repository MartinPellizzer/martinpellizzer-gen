    "intro": "Taraxacum hamidens, commonly known as the Persian dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to regions of Central Asia, including parts of Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The flower head produces a composite inflorescence that develops into a sphere of white, fluffy seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous areas."
