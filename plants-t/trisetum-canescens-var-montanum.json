    "intro": "Trisetum canescens var. montanum, commonly known as the mountain false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in disturbed or degraded landscapes."
