    "intro": "Triaristella huebneri, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a rare and striking evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy dark green leaves and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil and partial to full shade. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
