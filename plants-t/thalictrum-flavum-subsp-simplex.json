    "intro": "Thalictrum flavum subsp. simplex, commonly known as the yellow meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and woodland edges, preferring partial to full shade. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain numerous seeds. Thalictrum flavum subsp. simplex is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and subtle floral display."
