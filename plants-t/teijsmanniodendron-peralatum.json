    "intro": "Teijsmanniodendron peralatum, commonly known as the Malayan white cedar, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale-gray bark and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its wood is valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it important in local timber industries. However, due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable to extinction in the wild."
