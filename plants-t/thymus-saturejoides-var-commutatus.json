    "intro": "Thymus saturejoides var. commutatus, commonly known as Turkish thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit and small, aromatic leaves that are often used in cooking and traditional medicine. The plant produces pink or purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its medicinal and culinary uses."
