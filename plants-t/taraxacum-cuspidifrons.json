    "intro": "Taraxacum cuspidifrons, commonly known as the sharp-tipped dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spiny leaves and a single, upright stem that bears a yellow flower head. The plant is native to southern Europe and western Asia, and it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Its flowers produce small, wind-dispersed seeds with feathery pappi, aiding in its spread. The species is often confused with other dandelion species due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its distinctive leaf shape and habitat preferences."
