    "intro": "Taeniophyllum rostratum, commonly known as the rostrated spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features small, clustered leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is characterized by its unique rostrum-like structure on its seed capsule, which aids in seed dispersal. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
