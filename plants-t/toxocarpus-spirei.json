    "intro": "Toxocarpus spirei, commonly known as the Spirea saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features dense, compact clusters of small white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its compact appearance. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
