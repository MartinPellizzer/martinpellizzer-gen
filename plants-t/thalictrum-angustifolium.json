    "intro": "Thalictrum angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved meadow-rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a silvery underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
