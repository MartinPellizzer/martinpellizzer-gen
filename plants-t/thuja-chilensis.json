    "intro": "Thuja chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean arborvitae, is a coniferous evergreen native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its slow growth rate and aromatic foliage make it both decorative and ecologically valuable."
