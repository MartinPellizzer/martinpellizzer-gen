    "intro": "Thrixa hirta, commonly known as the woolly thrixa, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, clustered white flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture in dry conditions, making it well adapted to harsh climates. Thrixa hirta is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, soft-textured appearance."
