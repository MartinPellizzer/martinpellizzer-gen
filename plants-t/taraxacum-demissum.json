It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with a basal rosette of linear, hairy leaves. Its flowers are yellow and form a single composite head, which later develops into a fluffy white pappus for wind dispersal. The species is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, showing a preference for moist environments."
