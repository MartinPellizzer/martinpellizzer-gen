    "intro": "Trichocereus spachianus, commonly known as the Bolivian torch cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of Bolivia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and the presence of areoles, which are specialized structures that bear spines, flowers, and sometimes branches. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the night, which are pollinated by bats. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Trichocereus spachianus is also known for its potential use in traditional medicine and its role in the cultivation of cacti for ornamental purposes."
