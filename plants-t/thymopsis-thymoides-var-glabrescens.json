    "intro": "Thymopsis thymoides var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered with fine hairs, though the variety glabrescens is distinguished by its smoother, hairless foliage. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its essential oils contain thymol and carvacrol, contributing to its use in herbal medicine and as a culinary herb."
