    "intro": "Trochopteris elegans, commonly known as the elegant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes grow horizontally beneath the water's surface, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. Trochopteris elegans plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
