    "intro": "Thymus dolomiticus, commonly known as the Dolomitic Thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the limestone regions of southern Europe. It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its aromatic properties and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant or for its medicinal uses."
