    "intro": "Thymus munbyanus subsp. mastigophorus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other thyme species."
