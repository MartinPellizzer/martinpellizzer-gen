    "intro": "Trixis senecioides, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including livestock and humans. Its fibrous roots help it survive in dry conditions by storing water and nutrients. Trixis senecioides plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is not as widely cultivated as other milkweed species."
