    "intro": "Taraxacum accedens, commonly known as the Mexican dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a yellow flowering head that develops into a white, fluffy pappus for wind dispersal. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. Taraxacum accedens is often found growing in dry, open areas and is known for its resilience to environmental stress."
