    "intro": "Tritonia deusta subsp. miniata, commonly known as the dwarf bluebell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are lanceolate, often with a slightly hairy surface, and are arranged alternately along the stem. This subspecies is distinguished by its smaller size compared to the typical Tritonia deusta, with shorter stems and smaller flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas."
