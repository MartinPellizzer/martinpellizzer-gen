    "intro": "Thlaspi repens, commonly known as common rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in rocky and sandy soils. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops like cabbage and mustard. The plant has small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It is often found in alpine and arctic regions, where it is adapted to cold and harsh environments. Thlaspi repens is also known for its ability to tolerate heavy metal contamination in the soil, making it a useful indicator plant for environmental studies."
