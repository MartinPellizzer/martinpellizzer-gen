    "intro": "Tanakaea omeiensis var. nanchuanensis, commonly known as the Nanchuan variety of the Omei Mountain tanakaea, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a pale green hue. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as mountainous forests, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
