    "intro": "Torenia maculata, commonly known as the spotted torenia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while the stems are often hairy. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom continuously throughout the growing season."
