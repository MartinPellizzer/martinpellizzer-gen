    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 croatica, commonly known as the Croatian lime or European linden, is a hybrid species within the Tiliaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length and have a smooth, slightly hairy underside. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in drooping clusters, which bloom in early summer. These flowers are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological importance. The bark is smooth and light gray, with a tendency to peel in thin layers as the tree matures."
