    "intro": "Tecoma lepidophylla, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, pale blue or purple flowers that appear in clusters during the summer months. The plant has a short, woody stem and is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The ghost flower is also notable for its ephemeral nature, blooming only briefly before the flowers dry up and fall off."
