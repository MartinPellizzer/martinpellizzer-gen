    "intro": "Tillandsia calochlamys, commonly known as the golden tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with showy bracts that attract pollinators. Tillandsia calochlamys is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
