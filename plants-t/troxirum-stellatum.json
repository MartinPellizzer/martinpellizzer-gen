    "intro": "Troxirum stellatum, commonly known as the star-tipped orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often among moss and other epiphytic vegetation. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, and it produces a unique scent that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern."
