    "intro": "Taxus umbraculifera var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf yew, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, slow-growing form and dark green, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
