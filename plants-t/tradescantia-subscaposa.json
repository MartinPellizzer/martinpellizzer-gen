    "intro": "Tradescantia subscaposa, commonly known as the inch plant or snake plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically bluish-green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, often arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread easily, making it a popular choice for ground cover in shaded areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
