    "intro": "Taraxacum violaceifrons, commonly known as the violet-rayed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flower head surrounded by violet-colored bracts, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are deeply lobed and form a basal rosette, and it is known for its ability to produce a large number of seeds through a wind-dispersed mechanism. This species is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in temperate regions."
