    "intro": "Triticum violaceum, commonly known as purple wheat, is a species of wheat characterized by its distinctive violet-colored grains. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering heads produce small, spike-like clusters of florets, which are pollinated by wind. The botanical features of Triticum violaceum make it an interesting subject for both agricultural research and botanical study."
