    "intro": "Trillium smallii var. atropurpureocarpum, commonly known as the purple-fruit trillium, is a rare and striking member of the Trillium genus native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its three elliptical, dark green leaves and a single, showy white flower with three petals. The unique feature of this variety is its dark purple or black berries, which contrast sharply with its foliage. It thrives in moist, acidic soils in shaded woodlands, often in rich, undisturbed habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
