    "intro": "Tithymalus seguierianus, commonly known as the Seguierian tithymalus, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in dense clusters. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil. Due to its resilience, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a decorative plant in dry gardens."
