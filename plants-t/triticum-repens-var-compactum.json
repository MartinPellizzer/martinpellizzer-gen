    "intro": "Triticum repens var. compactum, commonly known as creeping wheatgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to temperate regions. It features dense, compact growth habit with short, rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences, typically with two to three florets per spikelet. Its leaves are narrow, slightly folded, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is often used in ornamental landscaping and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and adaptability."
