    "intro": "Tristachya hitchcockii, commonly known as the Hitchcock's triwing grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along streambanks. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
