    "intro": "Tylecodon schaeferianus, commonly known as the Schaefer's ice plant, is a member of the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and flowers. It is native to South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. Tylecodon schaeferianus is a low-growing shrub that is well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures."
