    "intro": "Tamarix leucocharis, commonly known as the white-tamarisk, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and pink to white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in saline conditions. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common invasive species in some regions. Tamarix leucocharis plays a role in stabilizing dunes but can outcompete native vegetation if left unchecked."
