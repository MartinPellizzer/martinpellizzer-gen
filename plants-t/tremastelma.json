    "intro": "Tremastelma, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their compact growth habit and showy yellow or orange flowers. They typically grow on rocky outcrops and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The leaves are usually succulent and arranged in a rosette, which helps reduce water loss. Tremastelma species are often used in rock gardens due to their ornamental value and drought tolerance."
