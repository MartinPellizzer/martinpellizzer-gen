    "intro": "Thymus decumbens, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features tiny, aromatic, yellowish-green leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover. Its compact growth habit and hardiness make it well-suited for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
