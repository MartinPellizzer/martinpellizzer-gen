It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, ovate leaves with a smooth, glabrous surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid climates for its attractive foliage."
