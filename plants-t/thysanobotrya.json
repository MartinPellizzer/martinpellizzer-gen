    "intro": "Thysanobotrya, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plants typically have showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from yellow to red, attracting various pollinators. Thysanobotrya species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They are often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields due to their adaptability and rapid growth."
