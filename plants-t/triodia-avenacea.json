    "intro": "Triodia avenacea, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss. Triodia avenacea plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
