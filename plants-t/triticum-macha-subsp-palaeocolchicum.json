    "intro": "Triticum macha subsp. palaeocolchicum, commonly known as the ancient wheat of the Carpathians, is a rare and ancient botanical species characterized by its unique genetic makeup and morphological traits. It is a small, annual grass with narrow, grass-like leaves and compact inflorescences, typically found in mountainous regions of Eastern Europe. This subspecies is notable for its potential role in the evolution of modern wheat species due to its genetic diversity and historical significance. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often associated with calcareous soils. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered plant species."
