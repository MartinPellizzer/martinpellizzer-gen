    "intro": "Taraxacum samicum, commonly known as the Sami dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in cold climates and is typically found in alpine and tundra environments. The plant features a rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and produces a yellow flowering head that develops into a fluffy white seed head. It has a deep taproot system, which allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. The species is adapted to withstand harsh weather conditions and is an important part of the local flora in its native habitat."
