    "intro": "Taraxacum sagittatum, commonly known as the arrowleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, yellow, composite flower head that develops into a distinctive, hollow, wind-dispersed seed head. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Taraxacum sagittatum is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other sunny, well-drained areas."
