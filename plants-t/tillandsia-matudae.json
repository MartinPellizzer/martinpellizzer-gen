    "intro": "Tillandsia matudae, commonly known as the Matudae airplant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
