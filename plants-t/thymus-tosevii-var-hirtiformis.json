It features dense clusters of tiny, aromatic leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically arranged in compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun exposure. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its use in culinary and medicinal applications."
