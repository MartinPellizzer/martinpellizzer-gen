    "intro": "Thujopsis dolabrata f. decumbens, commonly known as the creeping thuja, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features scale-like leaves that are typically a deep green, arranged in compact clusters along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that are followed by small, winged seeds. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun. This ornamental plant is valued for its hardiness and ability to form a low, attractive ground cover."
