    "intro": "Trifolium dentatum, commonly known as the toothed clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with serrated edges. This plant is native to Europe and is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Trifolium dentatum is also used in forage and as a cover crop due to its hardy nature and ecological benefits."
