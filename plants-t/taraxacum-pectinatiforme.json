    "intro": "Taraxacum pectinatiforme, commonly known as the pectinate dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, large, yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, wind-dispersed seed parachute, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
