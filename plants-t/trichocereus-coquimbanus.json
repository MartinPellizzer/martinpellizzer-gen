    "intro": "Trichocereus coquimbanus, commonly known as the \"Coco de Mer\" or \"Coco de Maya,\" is a species of cactus native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in the arid environment of the islands. Trichocereus coquimbanus is also notable for its slow growth rate and long lifespan, often living for several decades."
