    "intro": "Thymus acinos var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features tiny, aromatic leaves covered in fine, white hairs, which give it its \"hairy\" appearance. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in dense clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its compact growth and fragrant foliage, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry, sunny locations."
