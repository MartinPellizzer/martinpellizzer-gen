    "intro": "Thelypteris caribaea, commonly known as the Caribbean shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Caribbean region. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Thelypteris caribaea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
