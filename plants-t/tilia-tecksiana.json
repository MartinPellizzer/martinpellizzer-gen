    "intro": "Tilia tecksiana, commonly known as the Tecksian linden, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Central Asia. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The wood is light and durable, historically used for furniture and musical instruments."
