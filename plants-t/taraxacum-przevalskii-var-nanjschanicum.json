    "intro": "Taraxacum przevalskii var. nanjschanicum, commonly known as the Nanjing dandelion, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Xinjiang, China. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, slender flowering stem that bears a composite flower head with yellow ray florets and yellow disk florets. Its flowers are typically visited by various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
