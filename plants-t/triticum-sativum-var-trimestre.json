    "intro": "Triticum sativum var. trimestre, commonly known as the three-row wheat, is a variant of wheat characterized by its distinct three-row structure in the ear. This variety is primarily cultivated for its hardy nature and adaptability to a range of climatic conditions. The botanical features include slender spikes with closely spaced, awned glumes, and small, oval grains that are typically pale yellow when mature. It is often grown in temperate regions and is valued for its use in bread-making due to its high gluten content. The plant has a life cycle that includes a vegetative stage, heading, and grain filling, which are critical for its agricultural productivity."
