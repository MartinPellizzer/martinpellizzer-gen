It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a resinous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are trifoliate, and it thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure.
