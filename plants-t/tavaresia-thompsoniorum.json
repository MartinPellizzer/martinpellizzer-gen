It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, pentapetalous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments and has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. Its flowers are often pink or red, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
