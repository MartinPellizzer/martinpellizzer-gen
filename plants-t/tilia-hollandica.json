    "intro": "Tilia hollandica, commonly known as the Dutch lime or white lime, is a species of tree native to the Netherlands and parts of northern Europe. It is a small to medium-sized tree with heart-shaped leaves that are typically pale green on the underside. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are yellow-green in color and bloom in early summer. Its fruit is a small, hairy capsule that splits open to release seeds. Tilia hollandica is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance."
