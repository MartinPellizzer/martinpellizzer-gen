    "intro": "Typha angustifolia subsp. muelleri, commonly known as narrowleaf cattail, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of two distinct parts: a brown, fluffy spike and a green, seed-producing portion. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms and aiding in water filtration. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to the stability of wetland ecosystems."
