    "intro": "Triticum \u00d7 laxum, commonly known as the wild wheat, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and spikelets that bear small, hard grains. This plant is closely related to cultivated wheat species and is often found growing in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Triticum \u00d7 laxum has a complex genetic structure due to its hybrid origin, involving multiple wild wheat species. Its botanical features make it an important subject in studies of wheat evolution and genetics."
