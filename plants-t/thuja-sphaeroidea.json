    "intro": "Thuja sphaeroidea, commonly known as the globe thuja, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its spherical shape, which results from its dense, compact growth habit. The plant has scale-like leaves that are arranged in flat, fan-shaped sprays, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green cones, typical of the Cupressaceae family. Due to its unique form and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
