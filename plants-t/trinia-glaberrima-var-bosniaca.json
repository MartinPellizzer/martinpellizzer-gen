    "intro": "Trinia glaberrima var. bosniaca, commonly known as the Bosnian Trinia, is a rare and distinctive flowering plant native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
