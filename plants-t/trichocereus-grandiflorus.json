    "intro": "Trichocereus grandiflorus, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its stems are covered with spines and have a ribbed structure typical of cacti. Trichocereus grandiflorus is also known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in arid environments."
