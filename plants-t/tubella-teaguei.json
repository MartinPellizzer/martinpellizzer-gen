    "intro": "Tubella teaguei, commonly known as the Teague's tubeworm, is a marine polychaete annelid found in shallow coastal waters. It is characterized by its elongated, segmented body and a unique, tubular structure that houses its reproductive organs. The species is notable for its pale to reddish-brown coloration and the presence of numerous small, delicate bristles along its body. Tubella teaguei typically inhabits sandy or muddy substrates and is often found in association with other benthic organisms. Its ecological role includes contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as prey for various marine predators."
