    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. pinifolius, commonly known as creeping thyme with pine-like leaves, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features small, aromatic leaves that are slightly elongated and resemble pine needles, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover. Its fragrant foliage and hardy nature make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and medicinal plant collections."
