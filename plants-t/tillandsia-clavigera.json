    "intro": "Tillandsia clavigera, commonly known as the sword air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
