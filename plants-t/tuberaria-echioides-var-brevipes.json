    "intro": "Tuberaria echioides var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed rock cress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, basal leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, rounded pods. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
