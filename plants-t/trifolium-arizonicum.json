    "intro": "Trifolium arizonicum, commonly known as Arizona clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed sites. It has small, erect stems and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Arizona clover is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant communities."
