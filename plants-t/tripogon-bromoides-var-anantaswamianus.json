    "intro": "Tripogon bromoides var. anantaswamianus, commonly known as the Anantaswamianus grass, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit with narrow, linear leaves. The inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are typically pale green to golden in color. This variety is distinguished by its unique morphological features, including specific leaf venation and spikelet arrangement. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
