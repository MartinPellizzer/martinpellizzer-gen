    "intro": "Taraxacum investiens, commonly known as the purple ray floret dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright purple petals and yellow central disk, which distinguish it from the more common green-flowered dandelions. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem with a milky sap that is typical of the genus Taraxacum. It thrives in open, sunny areas and is often found in disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
