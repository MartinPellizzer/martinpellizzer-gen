    "intro": "Tectaria laciniata, commonly known as the fringed shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into narrow, overlapping segments, giving it a shield-like appearance. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous adventitious roots, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Tectaria laciniata is often found growing on rocks or in shaded forest floors, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
