    "intro": "Trifolium bracteatum, commonly known as the bracteate clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to South America and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, typical of the clover genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Trifolium bracteatum is also valued for its role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility."
