    "intro": "Taraxacum tornense, commonly known as the Tornese dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Central and Eastern Europe, including parts of Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a white, spherical seed head. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. The species is notable for its ability to propagate through both sexual and asexual means, contributing to its widespread distribution."
