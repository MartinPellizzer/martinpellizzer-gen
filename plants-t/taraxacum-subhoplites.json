    "intro": "Taraxacum subhoplites, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy rosettes. The plant features hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces a distinctive yellow flower that develops into a white, fluffy seed head. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
