    "intro": "Trichomanes abruptum, commonly known as the abrupt fern, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This species typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The sporangia are clustered in small groups called sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes abruptum is notable for its intricate leaf structure and its role in maintaining soil moisture and biodiversity in its native habitats."
