    "intro": "Tectaria griffithii var. amplissima, commonly known as the broad-leaf tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The fronds are typically divided into a series of pinnae, which are further subdivided into pinnules. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
