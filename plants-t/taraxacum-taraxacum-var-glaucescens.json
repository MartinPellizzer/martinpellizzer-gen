    "intro": "Taraxacum taraxacum var. glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-green dandelion, is a variant of the common dandelion characterized by its bluish-green leaves and yellow flowers. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has a taproot system and produces a distinctive seed head known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped with a hairy surface, and it is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies. This variety is often distinguished from other dandelion species by its unique leaf coloration and growth habits."
