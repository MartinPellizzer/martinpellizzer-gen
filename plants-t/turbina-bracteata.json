    "intro": "Turbina bracteata, commonly known as the bractean turban snail, is a species of air plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Turbinidae and is characterized by its spiral-shaped, calcareous shell that resembles a snail's shell. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its shell is typically pale in color with intricate patterns and ridges, providing camouflage in its natural habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often kept in terrariums or as a collector's item."
