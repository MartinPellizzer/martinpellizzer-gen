It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can reach heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a distinctive white or grayish underside. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing small, yellowish-green florets that attract pollinators like bees and flies."
