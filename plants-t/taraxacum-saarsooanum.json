    "intro": "Taraxacum saarsooanum, commonly known as the Saarsoo dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to parts of Eastern Europe and is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green leaves. The plant produces a single, tall, hairy stem topped with a spherical flower head composed of yellow ray florets. It blooms from late spring to early summer and is often found in meadows and disturbed soils. The seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like structure, typical of the genus Taraxacum."
