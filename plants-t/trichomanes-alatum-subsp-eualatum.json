    "intro": "Trichomanes alatum subsp. eualatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its intricate frond structure and ability to retain moisture make it a distinctive and ornamental plant in botanical gardens and natural habitats."
