It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
