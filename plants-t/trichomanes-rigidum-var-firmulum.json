    "intro": "Trichomanes rigidum var. firmulum, commonly known as the firm-leaf maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to certain regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are often covered in a thin layer of moisture. The plant prefers shaded, humid environments and is typically found in rocky or mossy areas. Its small, spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its leaves, which are usually only a few centimeters in length. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
