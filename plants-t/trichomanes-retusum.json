    "intro": "Trichomanes retusum, commonly known as the smooth holly fern, is a fern species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes retusum is notable for its intricate leaf venation and its ability to grow on rocks or tree trunks in its natural habitat."
