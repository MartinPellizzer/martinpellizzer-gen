    "intro": "Taxus adpressa adpressa-stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yew, is a member of the Taxaceae family and is native to parts of Asia. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain bird species. Its bark and foliage contain taxanes, which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
