    "intro": "Tubella fissa, commonly known as the fissured tubella, is a species of sea sponge belonging to the family Dendroceratidae. It is characterized by its elongated, branching structure with a distinctive fissured appearance on its surface. The sponge's body is composed of a flexible, porous skeleton made of spongin, which provides structural support. It typically inhabits shallow marine environments, often attached to rocky substrates. Tubella fissa plays a role in marine ecosystems by filtering water and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
