    "intro": "Tilia argentea, commonly known as silver linden, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, silver-white leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it has a spreading, rounded canopy. Silver linden is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in gardens for its shade and aesthetic appeal."
