It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Trifolium tenue is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
