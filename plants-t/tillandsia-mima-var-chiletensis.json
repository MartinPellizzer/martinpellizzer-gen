    "intro": "Tillandsia mima var. chiletensis, commonly known as the Chiltepe Tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the Andes mountains of Chile. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, high-altitude environments. Its foliage is typically silver-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
