    "intro": "Tilia oblongata, commonly known as the heartleaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically broad and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are followed by small, winged fruits. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it often has a rounded, spreading crown. Tilia oblongata is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
