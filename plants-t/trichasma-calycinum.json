    "intro": "Trichasma calycinum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silverleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Trichasma calycinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
