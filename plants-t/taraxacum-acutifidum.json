    "intro": "Taraxacum acutifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, elongated flower that turns into a spherical seed head with parachute-like seeds for wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Botanically, it is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower structure and medicinal properties."
