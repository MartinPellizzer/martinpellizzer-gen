    "intro": "Triodia cuprea, commonly known as the red spinifex, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is highly drought-tolerant. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Triodia cuprea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
