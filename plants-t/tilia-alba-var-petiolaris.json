    "intro": "Tilia alba var. petiolaris, commonly known as the slender-leaved linden, is a rare variant of the white poplar. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically longer than they are wide. This plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded woodland areas. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a fragrant, white bloom in early summer. The tree has a relatively slow growth rate and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
