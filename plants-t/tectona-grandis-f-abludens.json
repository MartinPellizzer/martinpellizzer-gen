    "intro": "Tectona grandis f. abludens, commonly known as the Bornean teak, is a rare and unique variant of the teak tree. It is characterized by its distinct foliage and bark, which differ from the typical teak species. This form is native to the tropical regions of Borneo and is adapted to specific environmental conditions. Its botanical features include lanceolate leaves with a distinctive silver underside and a dense, aromatic wood. Due to its limited distribution and unique traits, it holds significant ecological and horticultural interest."
