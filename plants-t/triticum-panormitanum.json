    "intro": "Triticum panormitanum, commonly known as the Panormitanum wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wheat native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, pale grains that differ from modern wheat varieties. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a short, sturdy stalk that supports its seed heads. Due to its limited distribution and historical significance, it is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers."
