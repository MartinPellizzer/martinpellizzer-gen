    "intro": "Tragacantha monanthema, commonly known as the single-flowered tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, solitary flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces a unique gum, similar to tragacanth, which has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are trifoliate, and it thrives in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or arid environments."
