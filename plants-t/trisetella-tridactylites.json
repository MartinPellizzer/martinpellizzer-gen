    "intro": "Trisetella tridactylites, commonly known as the three-toed sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian belonging to the order Hexacorallia. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched polyps and a central, calcified skeletal structure. The organism typically inhabits shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates. Its body is composed of a central column surrounded by multiple tentacles, which are used for capturing prey. Trisetella tridactylites plays a role in marine ecosystems by serving as both predator and prey."
