It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and broad, ovate leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing smooth seeds. It thrives in brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests along coastal areas. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial species."
