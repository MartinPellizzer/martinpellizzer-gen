It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in forested areas. Taxus cuspidata is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
