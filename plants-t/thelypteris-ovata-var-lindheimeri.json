    "intro": "Thelypteris ovata var. lindheimeri, commonly known as Lindheimer's shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features leathery, ovate-shaped fronds that are often divided into lanceolate segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to moist soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
