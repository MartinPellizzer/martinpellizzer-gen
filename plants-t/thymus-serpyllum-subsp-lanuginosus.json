It features small, gray-green leaves covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental value make it both a useful culinary herb and a desirable ornamental plant."
