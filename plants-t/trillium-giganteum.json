    "intro": "Trillium giganteum, commonly known as the giant trillium, is a striking North American woodland plant characterized by its three large, waxy petals and three sepals that are usually a different color. It thrives in rich, moist, acidic soils and is often found in deciduous forests. The plant blooms in late spring, producing a single, showy flower that attracts pollinators like bees and flies. Its leaves are also trifoliate, matching the flower's symmetry, and it is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Due to its beauty and rarity, it is often protected in its native habitats."
