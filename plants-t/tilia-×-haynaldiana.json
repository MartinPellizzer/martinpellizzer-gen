    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 haynaldiana, commonly known as the hybrid linden, is a deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Tilia cordata and Tilia europaea. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels, which bloom in early summer and are highly attractive to pollinators. Its bark is smooth and gray, with shallow fissures, and it can grow up to 20 meters tall. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in urban landscapes for its shade and aesthetic appeal."
