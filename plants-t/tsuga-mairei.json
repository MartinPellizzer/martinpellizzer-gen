    "intro": "Tsuga mairei, commonly known as the silver fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It has slender, needle-like leaves that are dark green on top and silvery white underneath, giving it its common name. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It typically grows in cool, moist environments and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Its botanical features make it an important species in New Zealand's native forests."
