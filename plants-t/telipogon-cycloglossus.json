    "intro": "Telipogon cycloglossus, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to wetland habitats in South America. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces striking, pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering period occurs during the wet season, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
