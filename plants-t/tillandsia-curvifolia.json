    "intro": "Tillandsia curvifolia, commonly known as the curly leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow, and often curling leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It thrives in humid environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
