    "intro": "Tapinanthus fragilis, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, often attaching itself to the stems or roots of other plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers and has delicate, thread-like leaves. It is known for its ephemeral nature, often appearing and disappearing rapidly in its habitat. Due to its parasitic lifestyle, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its environment."
