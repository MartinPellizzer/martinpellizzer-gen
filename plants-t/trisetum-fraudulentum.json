    "intro": "Trisetum fraudulentum, commonly known as the false beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems with fine, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, greenish-brown florets. Trisetum fraudulentum is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates."
