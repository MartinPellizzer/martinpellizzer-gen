    "intro": "Tragacantha crassa, commonly known as the Persian gum or tragacanth, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems, narrow leaves, and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a thick, sticky resin known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a binding agent. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
