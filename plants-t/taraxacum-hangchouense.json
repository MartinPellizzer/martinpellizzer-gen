    "intro": "Taraxacum hangchouense, commonly known as the Hangzhou dandelion, is a flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, hollow stem topped with a yellow composite flower head that blooms in spring. It is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
