    "intro": "Tarachia insignis, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant features a thick, fleshy stem covered in soft, woolly hairs, which helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing additional protection from heat and drought."
