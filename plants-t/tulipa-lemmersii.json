    "intro": "Tulipa lemmersii, commonly known as the Lemmer's tulip, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial bulbous plant that produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows to a height of 15 to 30 centimeters and blooms in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from the base of the plant. Tulipa lemmersii is well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings due to its compact size and ornamental value."
