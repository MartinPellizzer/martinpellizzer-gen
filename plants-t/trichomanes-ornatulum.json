    "intro": "Trichomanes ornatulum, commonly known as the ornate holly fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb humidity through its rhizomes. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, and they produce spores for propagation. Trichomanes ornatulum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
