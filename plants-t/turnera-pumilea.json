    "intro": "Turnera pumilea, commonly known as the \"Mexican moonflower,\" is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions."
