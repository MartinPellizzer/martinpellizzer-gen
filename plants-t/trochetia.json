    "intro": "Trochetia, commonly known as the mountain heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. These plants are shrubs with small, often evergreen leaves and produce bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. The genus is characterized by its ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils. Trochetia species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and hardiness in cooler climates."
