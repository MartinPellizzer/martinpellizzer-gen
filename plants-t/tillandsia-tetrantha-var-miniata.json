    "intro": "Tillandsia tetrantha var. miniata, commonly known as the miniature air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its foliage rather than roots. The plant features dense, compact rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with a greenish-white color, and it produces offsets that can be used for propagation. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
