    "intro": "Taraxacum croceum subsp. brachyceras, commonly known as the short-horned dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy pappus for seed dispersal. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides. It has a taproot system and is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more robust stem and smaller, more compact flower heads compared to other dandelion species."
