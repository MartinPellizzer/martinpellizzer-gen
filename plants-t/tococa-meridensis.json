    "intro": "Tococa meridensis, commonly known as the Andean coffee plant, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes other coffee species. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. Its fruits contain seeds that are used to make a type of coffee known as \"tococha.\" Due to its unique flavor profile and limited cultivation, it is considered a rare and valuable plant in the region."
