    "intro": "Trifolium monanthum subsp. monanthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or reddish in color, blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in soil stabilization and forage for livestock."
