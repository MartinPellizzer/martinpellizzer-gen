It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late summer. Thorelia montana thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare plant in its native range."
