    "intro": "Tragacantha chtonocephala, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to some animals, which serves as a defense mechanism. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Tragacantha chtonocephala plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils."
