    "intro": "Tillaea exserta, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Tillaea exserta thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in desert ecosystems."
