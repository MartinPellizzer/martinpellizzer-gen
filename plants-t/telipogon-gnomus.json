    "intro": "Telipogon gnomus, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact stature and delicate, often purple or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin soil of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specialized environment, Telipogon gnomus is considered a rare and endangered species."
