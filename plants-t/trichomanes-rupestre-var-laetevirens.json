It features delicate, linear fronds that are typically evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
