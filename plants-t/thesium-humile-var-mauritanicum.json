It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations. Due to its resilience and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
