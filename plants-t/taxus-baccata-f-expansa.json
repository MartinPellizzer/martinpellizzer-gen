    "intro": "Taxus baccata f. expansa, commonly known as the European yew with expanded leaves, is a cultivar of the yew tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its broader, more elongated leaves compared to the typical Taxus baccata, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is evergreen, with a conical shape and clusters of red, fleshy arils surrounding its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain toxic compounds."
