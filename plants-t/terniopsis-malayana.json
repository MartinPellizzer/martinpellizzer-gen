    "intro": "Terniopsis malayana, commonly known as the Malay mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the families Dipterocarpaceae and Euphorbiaceae. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Terniopsis malayana plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various bird species."
