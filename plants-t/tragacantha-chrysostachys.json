    "intro": "Tragacantha chrysostachys, commonly known as golden thorn, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a milky sap that has been traditionally used in folk medicine. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, while its roots are deep and drought-resistant. Tragacantha chrysostachys is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
