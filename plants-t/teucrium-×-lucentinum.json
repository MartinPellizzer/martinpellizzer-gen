    "intro": "Teucrium \u00d7 lucentinum, commonly known as the hybrid germander, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is a cross between Teucrium scorodonia and Teucrium polium, resulting in a plant with distinctive silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, blue-violet flowers. The leaves are often aromatic and have a slightly minty scent, while the stems are square and hairy, typical of the mint family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in temperate climates."
