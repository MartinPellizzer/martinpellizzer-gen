    "intro": "Taraxacum coryphorum, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive yellow flower that develops into a spherical, fluffy seed head, which is dispersed by the wind. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. Taraxacum coryphorum is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it adapts to cooler and harsher environmental conditions."
