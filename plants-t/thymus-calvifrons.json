    "intro": "Thymus calvifrons, commonly known as the sand thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features creeping stems that are often covered with fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly aromatic scent when crushed. Thymus calvifrons is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, thriving in full sun and drought conditions."
