    "intro": "Tillandsia polystachia var. alba, commonly known as the white-leaf air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid and shaded environments. The plant features long, narrow, white or pale green leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces delicate, bell-shaped inflorescences that are often white or pale in color. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
