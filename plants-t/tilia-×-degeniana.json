    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 degeniana, commonly known as the European lime or small-leaved lime, is a hybrid deciduous tree belonging to the Tiliaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of its parent species, Tilia europaea. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, round fruits. It is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and shade-providing canopy. The bark is smooth and greyish-brown, with a tendency to flake as the tree matures."
