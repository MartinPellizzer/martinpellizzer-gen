It is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its growth habit is shrub-like, with multiple stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Tassadia trailiana plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
