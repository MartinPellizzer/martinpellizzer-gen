    "intro": "Tillandsia rupestris, commonly known as the rock tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Tillandsia rupestris is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
