It is characterized by its distinctive, curved fruiting bodies that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rainforests or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a glossy surface. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
