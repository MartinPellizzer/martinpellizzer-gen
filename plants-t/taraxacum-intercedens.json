    "intro": "Taraxacum intercedens, commonly known as the interceding dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a spherical, fluffy seed head that disperses seeds via the wind, a common trait among members of the dandelion genus. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Taraxacum intercedens is a perennial herb that typically blooms from spring to early summer."
