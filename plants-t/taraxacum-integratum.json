    "intro": "Taraxacum integratum, commonly known as the purple dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem topped with a spherical inflorescence of yellow flowers that eventually develop into white, fluffy seeds. Its flowers bloom in spring and early summer, and the plant is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest clearings. Taraxacum integratum is notable for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
