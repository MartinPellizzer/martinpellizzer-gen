    "intro": "Tillandsia atroviridipetala, commonly known as the dark green-petaled air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces striking white to pale purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal soil, as it absorbs nutrients and water through its leaves. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
