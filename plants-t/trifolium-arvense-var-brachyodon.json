    "intro": "Trifolium arvense var. brachyodon, commonly known as the short-stemmed field clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. This variety is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
