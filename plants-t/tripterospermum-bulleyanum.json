    "intro": "Tripterospermum bulleyanum, commonly known as the New Zealand broom, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a shrub characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has compound leaves with oval, pointed leaflets and is adapted to grow in coastal and limestone soils. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. However, it is also considered a potential weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and spread."
