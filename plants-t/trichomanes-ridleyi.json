    "intro": "Trichomanes ridleyi, commonly known as the Ridley's huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and possesses a distinctive, wiry structure with lanceolate leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves. Trichomanes ridleyi is notable for its morphological adaptations that allow it to thrive in low-light conditions."
