    "intro": "Tragacantha myriacantha, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, corky bark and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of its characteristic gum resin. The resin, known as tragacanth, is harvested from the bark and has been used historically in various medicinal and culinary applications. Its botanical features make it an important species in its native ecosystem and a subject of botanical study."
