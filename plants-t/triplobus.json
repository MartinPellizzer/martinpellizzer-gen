It consists of several species native to South America, particularly in the Andean regions. The plants are shrubs or small trees with opposite, simple, and often elliptic leaves. They produce small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The fruits are small, fleshy berries that may be edible, though some species have toxic properties."
