    "intro": "Tillandsia ernestii, commonly known as Ernest's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white or pink. Tillandsia ernestii is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal direct sunlight."
