    "intro": "Tara tinctoria var. horrida, commonly known as the rough tara, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its woody shrub form and distinctive, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is valued for its historical use in traditional dyeing practices due to the presence of tannins in its bark and leaves. The variety 'horrida' is distinguished by its more rugged appearance compared to other tara species."
