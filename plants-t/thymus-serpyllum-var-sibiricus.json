    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. sibiricus, commonly known as Siberian thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It features creeping stems that form dense mats, often covered with small, grayish-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are highly aromatic and used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy ground cover plant. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and erosion control."
