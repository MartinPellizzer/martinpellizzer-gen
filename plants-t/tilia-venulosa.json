    "intro": "Tilia venulosa, commonly known as the Venulose Lime Tree, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which have a distinctive veining pattern that gives it its scientific name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and prefers well-drained, fertile soils. Tilia venulosa is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates."
