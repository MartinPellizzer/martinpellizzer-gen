    "intro": "Tillandsia nervibractea, commonly known as the silver pine tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped structure with long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a silvery bloom. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to maintain moisture. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
