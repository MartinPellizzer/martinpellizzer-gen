    "intro": "Tragacantha strigillosa, commonly known as the hairy tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody base and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs. Tragacantha strigillosa is valued for its mucilaginous sap, which has been used in traditional medicine and as a natural thickening agent."
