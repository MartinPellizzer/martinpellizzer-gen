    "intro": "Thelypteris subcalcarata, commonly known as the scarlet holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green fronds with a distinctive red or orange midrib, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Thelypteris subcalcarata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage."
