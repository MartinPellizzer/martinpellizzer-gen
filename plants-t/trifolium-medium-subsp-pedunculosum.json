It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It is valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage crop for livestock. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological and agricultural systems."
