    "intro": "Trianosperma tibiricae, commonly known as the Tibiric sandbloom, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme temperatures, making it a hardy species. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in spring, producing small yellow to orange blooms that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
