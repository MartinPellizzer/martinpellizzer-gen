    "intro": "Trilomisa, commonly known as the sacred flame plant, is a striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant red and orange tubular flowers that resemble flames, hence its common name. Its foliage consists of broad, waxy leaves that provide a lush green contrast to the fiery blooms. Trilomisa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also revered in local cultures for its symbolic significance."
