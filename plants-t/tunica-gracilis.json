    "intro": "Tunica gracilis, commonly known as the slender tunica, is a specialized plant structure found in certain fungal species. It is a thin, membranous layer that forms part of the fungal fruiting body. This layer is composed primarily of hyphae and provides structural support. The tunica gracilis plays a role in protecting the developing spores within the fruiting body. Its botanical significance lies in its contribution to the morphology and reproductive success of the fungus."
