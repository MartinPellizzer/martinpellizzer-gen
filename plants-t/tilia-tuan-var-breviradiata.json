    "intro": "Tilia tuan var. breviradiata, commonly known as the short-rayed Tuan lime, is a less commonly recognized variant of the Tilia genus. It is characterized by its compact, rounded leaves that are shorter and broader than those of typical Tilia species. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance, and it is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare in cultivation."
