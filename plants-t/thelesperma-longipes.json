It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Thelesperma longipes is also a host plant for several species of native butterflies and moths."
