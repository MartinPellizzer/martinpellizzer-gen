    "intro": "Tectaria moorei, commonly known as the Moore's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes and absorbing moisture from the air. Its leaves are usually leathery and have a dense, overlapping structure that helps retain water. Tectaria moorei is often found in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
