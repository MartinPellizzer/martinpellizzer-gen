    "intro": "Trifolium lupinaster var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop in temperate climates."
