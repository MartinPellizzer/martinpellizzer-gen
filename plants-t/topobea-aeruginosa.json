It is characterized by its striking copper-colored leaves that change with the seasons, displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Topobea aeruginosa is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks."
