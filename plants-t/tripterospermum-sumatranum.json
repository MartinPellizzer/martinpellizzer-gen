    "intro": "Tripterospermum sumatranum, commonly known as the Sumatran starfruit, is a climbing shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries resembling starfruits. Its fruits are edible, though they are not as commonly consumed as the tropical fruit known as starfruit. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional medicinal uses in its native regions."
