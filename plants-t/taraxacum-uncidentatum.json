    "intro": "Taraxacum uncidentatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, inconspicuous flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions and its role in supporting pollinators."
