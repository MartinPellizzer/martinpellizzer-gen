    "intro": "Trichomanes demissum, commonly known as the lesser moonwort, is a small, fern-like plant belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on the bases of trees in temperate regions. Its spores are borne on the underside of its leaves, which are arranged in a tight, fan-like structure. Trichomanes demissum is notable for its primitive morphology and is considered an ancient lineage within the fern group."
