It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trailing growth habit, often used in ornamental gardening. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in summer. Its tuberous roots are edible and resemble those of the sweet potato, though it is not closely related. Tristellateia dulcamara is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas."
