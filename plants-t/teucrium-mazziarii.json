    "intro": "Teucrium mazziarii, commonly known as the Maltese germander, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Malta and parts of Sicily. It is a perennial herb characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and spikes of small, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscapes. Teucrium mazziarii is also valued for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies."
