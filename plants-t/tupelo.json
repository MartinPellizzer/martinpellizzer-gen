It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree produces small, dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Tupelo trees are often found in wetland areas and are adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils. Its wood is valued for its durability and is used in furniture and cabinetry."
