    "intro": "Thalictrum sphaerocarpon, commonly known as the globular meadow rue, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a globular cluster, which is a distinctive feature. It typically grows in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its woodland environment, with rhizomes that help it survive in shaded conditions."
