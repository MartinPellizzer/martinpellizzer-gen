    "intro": "Trichonema columnae var. gallaecicum, commonly known as the Galician hair moss, is a rare and specialized moss species native to the coastal regions of Galicia, Spain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices along the Atlantic coast. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth and dark green, hair-like leaves that are tightly clustered. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and maintaining microhabitats in its coastal ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
