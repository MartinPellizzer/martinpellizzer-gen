    "intro": "Triticum compactum var. pseudosplendens, commonly known as the dwarf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, which makes it suitable for ornamental use in gardens. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun for optimal growth. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in erosion control and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
