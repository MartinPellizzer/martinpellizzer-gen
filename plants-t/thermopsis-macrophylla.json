It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in suitable climates. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
