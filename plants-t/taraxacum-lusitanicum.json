    "intro": "Taraxacum lusitanicum, commonly known as the Iberian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically lanceolate and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a single head, with both ray and disk florets. Taraxacum lusitanicum is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
