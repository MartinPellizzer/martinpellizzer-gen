It features compact, creeping stems that produce small, aromatic leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant bears tiny, pale yellow flowers clustered in dense spikes, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves and flowers are used in culinary and medicinal applications due to their essential oils. This variety is well adapted to rocky and limestone soils, making it a hardy plant in Mediterranean climates."
