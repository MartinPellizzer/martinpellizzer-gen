    "intro": "Tristellateia rigalii, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a unique succulent native to Madagascar. It features a compact, globular shape with a dense covering of yellowish-green spines. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Tristellateia rigalii is well adapted to arid environments, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
