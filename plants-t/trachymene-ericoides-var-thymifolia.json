    "intro": "Trachymene ericoides var. thymifolia, commonly known as thyme-leaved false Solomon's seal, is a herbaceous perennial native to southeastern Australia. It features slender, upright stems covered in small, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, dark blue berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Its foliage has a subtle thyme-like aroma, contributing to its common name."
