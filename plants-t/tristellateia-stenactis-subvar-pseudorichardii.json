    "intro": "Tristellateia stenactis subvar. pseudorichardii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tristellateia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Campanulaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. It typically blooms in late winter to early spring, adding a delicate touch of color to its natural habitat. Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun exposure."
