    "intro": "Tillandsia polyantha, commonly known as the pink tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid and shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup to collect rainwater, which it uses for hydration. Its flowers are striking, often displaying vibrant pink or red hues, and bloom in late summer or early autumn. Tillandsia polyantha is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
