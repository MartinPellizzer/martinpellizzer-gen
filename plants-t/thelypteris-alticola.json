    "intro": "Thelypteris alticola, commonly known as the highland shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a characteristic common to most fern species. Thelypteris alticola is often found in cloud forests and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its high-altitude habitat."
