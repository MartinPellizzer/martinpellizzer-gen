    "intro": "Tragopogon praecox, commonly known as the early thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces a slender, branching stem topped with a yellow flower head. Tragopogon praecox typically blooms in early spring, making it one of the first plants to emerge in the spring season. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
