It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is notable for producing a milky, latex-like sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its ability to thrive in harsh environments makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
