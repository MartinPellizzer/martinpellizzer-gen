    "intro": "Thalictrum princeps, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply divided and often covered in a fine, silky texture. The plant produces showy, spire-like clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer. Thalictrum princeps thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
