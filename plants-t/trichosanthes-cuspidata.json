    "intro": "Trichosanthes cuspidata, commonly known as the spear gourd, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, characterized by its climbing habit and distinctive, elongated fruits. The plant produces large, yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female blooms on the same plant. Its leaves are heart-shaped, with a rough texture and prominent veins, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The fruit, which can grow up to 2 meters in length, has a warty surface and a thick, fibrous rind. It is cultivated for its edible seeds and sometimes used in traditional medicine due to its purported health benefits."
