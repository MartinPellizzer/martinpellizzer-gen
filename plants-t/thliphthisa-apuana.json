    "intro": "Thliphthisa apuana, commonly known as the Apuan rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Italy. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. Its foliage consists of small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Thliphthisa apuana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a border plant."
