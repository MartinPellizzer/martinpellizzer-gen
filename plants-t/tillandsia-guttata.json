    "intro": "Tillandsia guttata, commonly known as the silver-tipped air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often attaching itself to trees or rocks. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces striking white or pale blue flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia guttata is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light to thrive."
