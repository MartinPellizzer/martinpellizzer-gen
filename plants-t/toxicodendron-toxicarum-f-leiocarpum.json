It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is native to parts of Asia, particularly China. The plant is known for its urushiol-containing sap, which can cause severe skin irritation in humans. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets arranged in a palmate pattern. This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks."
