    "intro": "Trientalis americana, commonly known as the American starflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clustered foliage. The plant produces small, star-shaped white or yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are elliptical and often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, acidic soils in shaded environments. Trientalis americana is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role."
