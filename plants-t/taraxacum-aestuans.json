    "intro": "Taraxacum aestuans, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. The plant produces achenes, which are small, dry fruits with a pappus that aids in wind dispersal. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. Taraxacum aestuans is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in a variety of environmental conditions."
