    "intro": "Thuja lavandulifolia, commonly known as the lavenderleaf arborvitae, is a coniferous evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and foliage that resembles lavender in color, giving it its common name. The plant has scale-like leaves that are arranged in flat sprays, and it produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green cones. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for hedges and ornamental landscaping. Due to its slow growth rate, it is often used in formal garden designs."
