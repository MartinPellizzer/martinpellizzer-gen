    "intro": "Tussacia apicroides, commonly known as the woolly tussac, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a perennial grass-like plant characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fibrous root system. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Tussacia apicroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
