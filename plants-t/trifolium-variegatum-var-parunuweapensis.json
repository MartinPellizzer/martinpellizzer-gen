    "intro": "Trifolium variegatum var. parunuweapensis, commonly known as the Parunuweap clover, is a rare and endemic species native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, often with a distinctive variegated pattern of green and white. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
