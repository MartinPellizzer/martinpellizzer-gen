    "intro": "Taraxacum galbaniforme, commonly known as the yellow starwort, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets and a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, and sometimes sticky stem that rises from the center of the leaf rosette. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The species is notable for its ability to produce a milky latex when the stems or leaves are damaged."
