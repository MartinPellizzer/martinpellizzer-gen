It features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a robust root system that helps prevent soil erosion. It is often cultivated for forage and as a green manure crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its seeds are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
