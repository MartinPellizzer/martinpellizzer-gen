    "intro": "Thalictrum lucidum, commonly known as the golden meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that create a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a subtle yet elegant touch to gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant collections and ecological restoration projects."
