    "intro": "Thelypteris modesta, commonly known as the common shield fern, is a species of polypod fern native to various regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris modesta plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
