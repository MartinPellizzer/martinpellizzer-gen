    "intro": "Thlaspi exile, commonly known as rock\u767d\u83dc or winter cress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other economically important plants such as mustard and cabbage. Thlaspi exile typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. It is also known for its ability to tolerate extreme cold and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
