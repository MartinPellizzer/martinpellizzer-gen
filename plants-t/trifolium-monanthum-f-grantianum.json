    "intro": "Trifolium monanthum f. grantianum, commonly known as the Grant's clover, is a rare and distinctive variant of the clover genus. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a single, prominent flower per stem, which sets it apart from other trifoliate species. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its trifoliate leaves are usually small and have a deep green color, with a slightly hairy texture. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance."
