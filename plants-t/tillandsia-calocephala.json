    "intro": "Tillandsia calocephala, commonly known as the velvet leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with purple or red flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
