    "intro": "Telipogon nobilis, commonly known as the noble telipogon, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that are often greenish or brownish in color. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical study is important for understanding the biodiversity of high-altitude ecosystems."
