It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in grassy areas and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Trifolium piligerum is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria."
