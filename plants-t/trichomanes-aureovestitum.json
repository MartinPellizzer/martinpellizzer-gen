    "intro": "Trichomanes aureovestitum, commonly known as the golden-clothed huperbion, is a rare fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically small, narrowly lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, golden-hued coating. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
