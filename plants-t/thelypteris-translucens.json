    "intro": "Thelypteris translucens, commonly known as the translucent wood fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often have a translucent or waxy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps it anchor in soil and absorb nutrients. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive pattern of sori that are clustered near the margins of the leaves."
