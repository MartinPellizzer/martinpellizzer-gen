    "intro": "Tragopogon dalechampii, commonly known as yellow goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces a tall, slender stem with narrow, grass-like leaves and features a bright yellow flower that blooms in the summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal. Tragopogon dalechampii is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
