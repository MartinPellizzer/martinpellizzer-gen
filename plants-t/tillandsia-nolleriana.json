    "intro": "Tillandsia nolleriana, commonly known as the Noller's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its inflorescence produces small, white or pale pink flowers, which are often overlooked due to the plant's subtle appearance. Tillandsia nolleriana is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
