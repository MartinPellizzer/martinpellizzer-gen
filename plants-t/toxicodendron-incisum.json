    "intro": "Toxicodendron incisum, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that turn bright red in the fall, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fuzzy berries. The plant contains urushiol, a toxic resin that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges and open fields. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
