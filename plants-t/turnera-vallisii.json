    "intro": "Turnera vallisii, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or arid environments. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
