    "intro": "Thymus attenuatus, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, pink to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, have been used traditionally for their antimicrobial and medicinal properties."
