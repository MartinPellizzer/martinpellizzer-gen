    "intro": "Thelypteris wrightii, commonly known as Wright's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous, and the fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a soft, velvety texture. Thelypteris wrightii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
