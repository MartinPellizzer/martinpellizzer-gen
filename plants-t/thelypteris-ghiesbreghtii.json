    "intro": "Thelypteris ghiesbreghtii, commonly known as the Ghiesbreght's shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
