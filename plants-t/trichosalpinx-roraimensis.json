    "intro": "Trichosalpinx roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima torch orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant red and yellow flowers that resemble torches. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures that help retain moisture. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
