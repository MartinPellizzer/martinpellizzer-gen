    "intro": "Tieghemopanax fruticosus, commonly known as the climbing cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the family Cycadaceae. It is characterized by its palm-like appearance, with a tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in humid, shaded environments. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
