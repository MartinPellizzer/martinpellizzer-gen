    "intro": "Taraxacum elegans, commonly known as the elegant dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that terminates in a flower head. The flowers are yellow and consist of numerous small florets arranged in a composite head. After flowering, the plant produces a distinctive, hollow, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus. It is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils."
