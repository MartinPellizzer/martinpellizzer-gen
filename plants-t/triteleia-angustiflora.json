    "intro": "Triteleia angustiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved glory-of-the-snow, is a perennial bulbous plant native to California. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped white flowers with purple tips during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
