    "intro": "Ternstroemia carinata, commonly known as the ridge-leaf ternstroemia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Theaceae, which includes camellias and other ornamental plants. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves with a distinct midrib ridge, giving it its common name. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
