    "intro": "Tynanthus pubescens, commonly known as the silky sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, showcasing its adaptability to arid environments. Its hairy leaves and stems give it a distinctive, silvery appearance, which helps reduce water loss. Tynanthus pubescens plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich blooms."
