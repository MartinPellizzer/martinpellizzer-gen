    "intro": "Thunia alba var. bensoniae, commonly known as the white sea anemone, is a rare marine plant species belonging to the family Pennatae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent white flowers that resemble sea anemones, which give it its common name. This variety is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it thrives in sandy or rocky substrates. The plant plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various small aquatic organisms. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
