    "intro": "Tectaria jermyi, commonly known as the Jermy's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish, papery scales. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Tectaria jermyi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
