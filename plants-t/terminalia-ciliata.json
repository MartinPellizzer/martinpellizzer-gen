    "intro": "Terminalia ciliata, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and elliptical leaves with ciliate margins. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is often found in savanna and woodland habitats, and its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain. Terminalia ciliata plays an important role in local ecosystems and has traditional uses in medicine and construction."
