    "intro": "Tillandsia astragaloides, commonly known as the silver leaf air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hair, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant is adapted to grow on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through roots. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale purple, and it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. Tillandsia astragaloides requires bright, indirect light and regular misting to thrive in a home environment."
