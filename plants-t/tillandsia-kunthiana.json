    "intro": "Tillandsia kunthiana, commonly known as the silver vase bromeliad, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, which is used to collect rainwater. Its striking silver-green foliage and occasional flowering make it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity."
