    "intro": "Trichosalpinx jostii, commonly known as the Jost's spider orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, filamentous petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichosalpinx jostii is considered a rare and endangered species."
