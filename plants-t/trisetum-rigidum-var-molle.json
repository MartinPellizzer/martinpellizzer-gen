    "intro": "Trisetum rigidum var. molle, commonly known as soft rigid feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that are slightly more flexible than the typical variety, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ornamental addition to native plant gardens."
