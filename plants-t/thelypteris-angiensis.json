    "intro": "Thelypteris angiensis, commonly known as the Angolan holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia. Thelypteris angiensis plays a role in local ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
