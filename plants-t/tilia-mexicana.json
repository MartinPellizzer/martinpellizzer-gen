    "intro": "Tilia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican lime tree, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces small, round fruits that are typically green when mature, though they are not commonly used for culinary purposes. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and ornamental horticulture."
