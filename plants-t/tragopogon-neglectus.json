    "intro": "Tragopogon neglectus, commonly known as the goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a cluster of small flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a distinctive purple center. Tragopogon neglectus is also known for its ability to hybridize with other species in the genus, leading to the creation of new, often sterile, hybrid forms."
