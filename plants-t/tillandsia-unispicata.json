    "intro": "Tillandsia unispicata, commonly known as the single-bract air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces a single, elongated flower spike that bears a single, showy inflorescence. This species is popular among air plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
