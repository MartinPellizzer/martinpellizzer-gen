    "intro": "Taraxacum vulgum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a fluffy, white pappus that allows seeds to be carried by the wind. It is native to Europe but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. Taraxacum vulgum is known for its medicinal properties and is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed soils."
