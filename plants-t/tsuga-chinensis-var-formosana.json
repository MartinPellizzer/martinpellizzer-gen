    "intro": "Tsuga chinensis var. formosana, commonly known as the Formosan hemlock, is a medium-sized evergreen conifer native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
