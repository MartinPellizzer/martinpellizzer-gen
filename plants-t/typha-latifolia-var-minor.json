    "intro": "Typha latifolia var. minor, commonly known as narrowleaf cattail, is a variant of the common cattail found in wetland habitats. It is characterized by its narrower, more upright leaves compared to the typical broadleaf form. The plant produces cylindrical, brownish flower spikes that are often used in ecological restoration projects. It plays a vital role in water filtration and provides habitat for various wetland species. Its rhizomes contribute to soil stabilization in marshy environments."
