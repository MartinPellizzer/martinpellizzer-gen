It is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in horticulture for its fragrance and visual appeal."
