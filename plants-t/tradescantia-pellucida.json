    "intro": "Tradescantia pellucida, commonly known as the glasshouse plant or silver sword, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, waxy blue-green foliage that often has a translucent or glass-like appearance, especially under sunlight. The plant produces small, pale pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and prefers bright, indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is widely cultivated as a houseplant."
