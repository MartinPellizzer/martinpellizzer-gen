    "intro": "Tithymalus gerardii, commonly known as Gerard's tithymale, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It produces small white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
