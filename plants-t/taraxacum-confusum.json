    "intro": "Taraxacum confusum, commonly known as the confused dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which are typical of the dandelion genus. It produces a distinctive seed head with parachute-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including lawns and meadows."
