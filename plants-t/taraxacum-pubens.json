    "intro": "Taraxacum pubens, commonly known as the pubescent dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, or pubescent, stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other dandelion species. The plant produces a single, bright yellow composite flower head that develops into a fluffy seed head with parachute-like seeds. It is native to North America and thrives in disturbed soils and open areas. Taraxacum pubens is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other sunny habitats."
