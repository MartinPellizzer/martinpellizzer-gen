It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky inflorescence that resembles a crown or cap, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by bracts that form a spherical structure. It typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to arid environments. The subspecies gonocarpus is distinguished by its unique reproductive structures and seed dispersal mechanisms."
