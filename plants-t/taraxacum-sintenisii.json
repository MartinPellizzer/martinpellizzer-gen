    "intro": "Taraxacum sintenisii, commonly known as the Sintenis' dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a long, hollow stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces wind-dispersed seeds with feathery pappus, a common trait among members of the genus. It is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
