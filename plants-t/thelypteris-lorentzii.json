    "intro": "Thelypteris lorentzii, commonly known as the Lorentz holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, rounded sori on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Thelypteris lorentzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
