    "intro": "Tillandsia setiformis, commonly known as the feathered air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant that absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through roots. Native to Central and South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features long, slender leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It is popular as a low-maintenance indoor plant due to its ability to survive without soil."
