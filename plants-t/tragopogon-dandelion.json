    "intro": "Tragopogon dandelion, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flower heads that resemble the sun, which later develop into fluffy white seed heads known as \"puffballs.\" The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and spoon-shaped. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including lawns, meadows, and disturbed soils, and is often considered a weed. The dandelion is known for its ability to reproduce both sexually and asexually through its seeds and rhizomes."
