    "intro": "Trisetum spicatum subsp. pilosiglume, commonly known as the hairy lemma beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and has narrow, linear leaves with hairy surfaces. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged in panicles, with the lemmas bearing distinctive hairy structures. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
