    "intro": "Tillandsia punctulata, commonly known as the spotted air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia punctulata produces striking pink or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to thrive."
