    "intro": "Trichoglottis tinekeae, commonly known as the Tinekeae orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the rainforests of Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green, often arranged in a loose inflorescence. Trichoglottis tinekeae is adapted to shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
