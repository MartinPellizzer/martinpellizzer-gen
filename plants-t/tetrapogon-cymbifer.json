It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds with a prominent midrib. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The saddle-backed fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
