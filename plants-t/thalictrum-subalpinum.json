    "intro": "Thalictrum subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and alpine meadows. The plant features slender, branched stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided leaflets that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Thalictrum subalpinum is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local biodiversity in its native habitats."
