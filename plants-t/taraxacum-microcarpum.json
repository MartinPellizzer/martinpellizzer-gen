    "intro": "Taraxacum microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a pappus-equipped seed head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is a perennial herb that produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other sunny areas."
