    "intro": "Trifolium bivestitum, commonly known as the two-habitat clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters. It is native to Europe and is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides. Trifolium bivestitum has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through its root nodules, making it an important plant for soil enrichment."
