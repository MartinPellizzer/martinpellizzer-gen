    "intro": "Tmesipteris zamorarum, commonly known as the Zamora water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Tmesipteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal. Tmesipteris zamorarum plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
