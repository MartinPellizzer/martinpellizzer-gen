    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum subsp. viridis, commonly known as green thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. The plant has aromatic, narrow leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its subspecies distinction is based on its slightly broader leaves and more vigorous growth compared to the typical Thymus serpyllum."
