    "intro": "Tounatea acuminata var. puberula, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is native to Central and South America and is often found in wetland or disturbed habitats. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal, it can become invasive in certain regions."
