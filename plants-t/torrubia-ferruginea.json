    "intro": "Torrubia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty torrubia, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with reddish-brown stems and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers in spring, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and limestone habitats. Torrubia ferruginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
