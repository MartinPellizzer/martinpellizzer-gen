    "intro": "Thelypteris conspersa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris conspersa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
