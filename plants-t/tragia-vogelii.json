    "intro": "Tragia vogelii, commonly known as the velvetleaf or prickly pear, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its spiny stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, three-lobed fruits. Tragia vogelii is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, arid environments. Its botanical features make it both a notable weed and an important species in ecological studies."
