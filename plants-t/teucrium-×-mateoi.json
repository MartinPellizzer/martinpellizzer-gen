    "intro": "Teucrium \u00d7 mateoi, commonly known as hybrid germander, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Teucrium chamaedrys and Teucrium polium. It is a low-growing perennial herb with aromatic, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its medicinal properties have been historically noted, though it is generally considered non-toxic to humans."
