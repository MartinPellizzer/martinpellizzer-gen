    "intro": "Thelypteris palustris f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy swamp fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, hairy fronds. It is native to wetland habitats in North America, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are covered in fine, pubescent hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments."
