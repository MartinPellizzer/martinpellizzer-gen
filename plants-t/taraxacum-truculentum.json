    "intro": "Taraxacum truculentum, commonly known as the rough dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other dandelion species. The plant produces a single, showy yellow flower that develops into a fluffy seed head, typical of the genus Taraxacum. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The rough dandelion is adapted to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a common weed in gardens and fields."
