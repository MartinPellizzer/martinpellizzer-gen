    "intro": "Tristellateia isalensis, commonly known as the Isla fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble those of other members of the Polypodiaceae family. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the undergrowth of tropical rainforests. Its spores are released in clusters, a unique reproductive feature that sets it apart from many other fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tristellateia isalensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
