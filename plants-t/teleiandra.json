    "intro": "Teleiandra, commonly known as the false hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plants are characterized by their showy, often colorful flowers, which can be single or double, and their alternate, palmate leaves. Teleiandra species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, and they are often found in moist, shaded environments. Some species are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their attractive foliage and blooms."
