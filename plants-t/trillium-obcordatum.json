    "intro": "Trillium obcordatum, commonly known as the white trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features three broadly ovate leaves that are often mottled with brown or purple markings. The plant produces a single, white, showy flower with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in early spring. Its flowers are typically followed by three red or orange berries that mature in late summer. Trillium obcordatum is a shade-tolerant species that thrives in rich, moist woodlands and is often found in forest understories."
