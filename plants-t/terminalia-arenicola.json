    "intro": "Terminalia arenicola, commonly known as the coastal Terminalia, is a small to medium-sized tree native to coastal regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, round drupes that are typically red or orange when mature. It is adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a common species in coastal dunes and mangrove ecosystems. Terminalia arenicola plays an important role in stabilizing coastal environments and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
