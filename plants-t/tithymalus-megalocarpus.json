It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its fruits are distinctive, with large, inflated mericarps that aid in seed dispersal. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
