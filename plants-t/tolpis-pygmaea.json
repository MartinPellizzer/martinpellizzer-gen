    "intro": "Tolpis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf lily, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features delicate, nodding flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and grows to a height of only a few inches, making it well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Tolpis pygmaea is relatively low maintenance and attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
