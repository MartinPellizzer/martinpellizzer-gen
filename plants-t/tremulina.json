    "intro": "Tremulina, commonly known as the trembling willow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Salicaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and small, heart-shaped leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The leaves are typically arranged alternately along the stems and may have a slightly serrated edge. Tremulina species are often found in moist, temperate regions and are known for their ability to thrive in shaded environments. The flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and they produce small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
