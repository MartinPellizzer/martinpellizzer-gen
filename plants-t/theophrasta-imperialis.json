It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from deep purples to soft pinks, often with intricate patterns. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It blooms during the dry season, relying on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
