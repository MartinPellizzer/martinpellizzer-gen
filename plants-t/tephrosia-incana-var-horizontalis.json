It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are hairy on the underside. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in racemes. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental gardening for its ground-covering habit."
