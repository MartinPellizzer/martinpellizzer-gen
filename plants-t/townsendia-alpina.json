    "intro": "Townsendia alpina, commonly known as the alpine townsendia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Townsendia alpina is often found in meadows and open slopes at high elevations, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
