    "intro": "Taraxacum macrotomum, commonly known as the giant dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family. It is characterized by its large, bright yellow composite flower head and a distinctive, elongated stem. The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem that can grow up to several feet tall, making it easily distinguishable from other dandelion species. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture. This species is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia."
