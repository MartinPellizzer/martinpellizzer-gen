    "intro": "Tryphostemma reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined leaf vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, net-veined leaves and showy, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
