    "intro": "Thuja laetevirens, commonly known as the golden thuja, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and its striking golden-yellow foliage, which becomes more pronounced in full sun. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in flat sprays, and it produces seed cones that are typically 1 to 2 centimeters in length. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its slow growth rate, it is often used as a hedge or specimen plant in gardens."
