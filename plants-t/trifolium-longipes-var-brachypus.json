    "intro": "Trifolium longipes var. brachypus, commonly known as the short-stemmed clover, is a variant of the long-stemmed clover species native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more densely clustered leaves compared to the typical variety. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate floral display to its habitat. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, typical of the genus Trifolium. This variant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks."
