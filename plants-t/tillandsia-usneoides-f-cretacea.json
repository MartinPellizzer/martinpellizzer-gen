    "intro": "Tillandsia usneoides f. cretacea, commonly known as the Cretaceous Spanish moss, is a variant of the air plant Tillandsia usneoides. It is an epiphytic plant that thrives by attaching itself to trees and other surfaces without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its long, hanging, thread-like stems that form dense, moss-like clusters. It is native to regions in the Americas, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. This form is notable for its historical presence in fossil records, indicating its ancient lineage."
