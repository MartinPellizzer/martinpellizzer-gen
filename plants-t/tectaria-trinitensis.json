    "intro": "Tectaria trinitensis, commonly known as the Trinidad fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dissemination rather than seeds. Tectaria trinitensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
