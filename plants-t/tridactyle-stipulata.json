It is characterized by its distinctive tripartite stipules, which are leaf-like structures at the base of the leaves. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually with five petals, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Tridactyle stipulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
