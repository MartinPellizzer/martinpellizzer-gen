    "intro": "Trifolium petitianum var. cuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. This variety is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage crop for livestock."
