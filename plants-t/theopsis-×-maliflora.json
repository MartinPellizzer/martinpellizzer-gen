It is native to the southern United States and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps it retain moisture. Theopsis \u00d7 maliflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
