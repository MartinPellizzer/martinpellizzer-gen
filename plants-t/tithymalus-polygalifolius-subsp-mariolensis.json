    "intro": "Tithymalus polygalifolius subsp. mariolensis, commonly known as the Mariolensian tithymalus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The leaves are lanceolate, with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. It is often found in rocky or limestone habitats, where it forms dense mats or low-growing clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
