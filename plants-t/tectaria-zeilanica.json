    "intro": "Tectaria zeilanica, commonly known as the Zeilanica shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, and often leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments with a shield-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
