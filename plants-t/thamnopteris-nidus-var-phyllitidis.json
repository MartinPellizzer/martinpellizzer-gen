    "intro": "Thamnopteris nidus var. phyllitidis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a variant of the rock fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial plant characterized by its clustered growth habit and leathery, dark green fronds. The fronds are typically divided into narrow, finger-like segments, giving the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
