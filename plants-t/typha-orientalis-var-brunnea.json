    "intro": "Typha orientalis var. brunnea, commonly known as the brown rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, pale brown flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are typically found at the top of the stems. Its leaves are long, narrow, and have a slightly rough texture. This variety is adapted to moist or waterlogged soils and plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
