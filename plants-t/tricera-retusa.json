    "intro": "Tricera retusa, commonly known as the smoothleaf trichocereus, is a cactus species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom at night, a trait common among many cacti adapted to desert environments. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce transpiration. Tricera retusa is well-suited to grow in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xerophytic gardens."
