    "intro": "Taraxacum elongatihastatum, commonly known as the elongated hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly elliptic, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, elongated achenes that are dispersed by wind. It is typically found in moist meadows and grasslands, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
