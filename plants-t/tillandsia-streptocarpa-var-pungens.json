    "intro": "Tillandsia streptocarpa var. pungens, commonly known as the spiked air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with bright red or orange flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
