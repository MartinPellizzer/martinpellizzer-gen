    "intro": "Taraxacum olitorium, commonly known as lawn dandelion or edible dandelion, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head with pappus feathers that aid in wind dispersal. Its leaves are edible and have a slightly bitter taste, often used in salads or as a vegetable. The entire plant contains various bioactive compounds, making it valuable in both culinary and medicinal contexts."
