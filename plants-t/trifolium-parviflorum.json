    "intro": "Trifolium parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, enriching the soil. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
