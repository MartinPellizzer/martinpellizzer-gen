    "intro": "Trifolium stipulaceum, commonly known as the stipulate clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically around a central stem. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in early spring. Trifolium stipulaceum is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
