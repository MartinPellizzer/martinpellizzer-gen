    "intro": "Themeda gigantea var. subsericans, commonly known as the giant kangaroo grass, is a tall, perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its robust, erect stems and large, broad leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale-green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This grass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
