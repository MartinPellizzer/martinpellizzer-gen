    "intro": "Thlaspiceras, commonly known as the \"sea holly,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers, which are typically arranged in a composite head surrounded by bracts. The leaves are usually linear and covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Thlaspiceras species are native to regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East, where they thrive in rocky or sandy soils. These plants are often used in ornamental gardening due to their unique appearance and drought tolerance."
