    "intro": "Taraxacum calcem-amans, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a yellow flowering head that produces wind-dispersed seeds. This species is typically found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its ability to survive in harsh mountain environments is due to its hardy nature and efficient reproductive strategies. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in high-altitude ecosystems."
