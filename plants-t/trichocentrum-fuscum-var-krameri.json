    "intro": "Trichocentrum fuscum var. krameri, commonly known as the Krameri orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender stems and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
