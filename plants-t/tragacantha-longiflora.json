    "intro": "Tragacantha longiflora, commonly known as the Persian gum or long-flowered tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems, lance-shaped leaves, and clusters of yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a valuable gum resin from its exuding sap, which has been used historically in medicine and industry. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Due to its ecological and economic significance, it is often cultivated in regions with suitable growing conditions."
