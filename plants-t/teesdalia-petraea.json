    "intro": "Teesdalia petraea, commonly known as the desert parsley, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Teesdalia petraea is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
