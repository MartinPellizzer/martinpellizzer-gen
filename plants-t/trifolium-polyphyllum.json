    "intro": "Trifolium polyphyllum, commonly known as the purple clover, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its clusters of small, purple-pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It plays an important role in soil stabilization and is a valuable forage plant for livestock. Trifolium polyphyllum is also a member of the legume family, capable of fixing nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
