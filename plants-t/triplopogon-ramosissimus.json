    "intro": "Triplopogon ramosissimus, commonly known as the hairy grass or slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often branch profusely, giving it a dense appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish bracts, and its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in shaded forest understories. Triplopogon ramosissimus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
