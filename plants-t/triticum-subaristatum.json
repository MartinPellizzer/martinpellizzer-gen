    "intro": "Triticum subaristatum, commonly known as intermediate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, with inflorescences that are typically spike-like and bear small, two-lobed spikelets. The plant is known for its high biomass production and drought tolerance, making it suitable for forage and erosion control. Its genetic makeup includes a mix of wild and domesticated wheat genes, which contributes to its adaptability and resilience. Triticum subaristatum is also valued for its potential in developing new wheat varieties with improved traits."
