    "intro": "Tylecodon nolteei, commonly known as the Noltee's ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is a low-growing shrub with a compact, rosette-like form. Tylecodon nolteei is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
