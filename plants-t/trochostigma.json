    "intro": "Trochostigma, commonly known as the \"sickle-leaf orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its unique leaf shape, which often resembles a sickle or crescent, giving it its common name. The plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. They typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks. The flowers are usually small and fragrant, with a complex structure that includes specialized petals and sepals."
