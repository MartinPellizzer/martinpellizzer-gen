    "intro": "Thelasis mamberamensis, commonly known as the Malagasy orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and vibrant colors. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the rainforests of Madagascar. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered threatened and is the subject of conservation efforts."
