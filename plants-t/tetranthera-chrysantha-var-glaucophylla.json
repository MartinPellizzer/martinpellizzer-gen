    "intro": "Tetranthera chrysantha var. glaucophylla, commonly known as the golden glaucous fern, is a variant of the golden fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, glaucous (bluish-gray) leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
