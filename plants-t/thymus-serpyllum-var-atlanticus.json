    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. atlanticus, commonly known as Atlantic thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of the eastern United States. It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a strong, aromatic scent reminiscent of traditional thyme. The plant produces tiny, pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant ground cover. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and use in culinary and medicinal applications."
