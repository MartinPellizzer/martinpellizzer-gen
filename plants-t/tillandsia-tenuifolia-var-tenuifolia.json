    "intro": "Tillandsia tenuifolia var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
