    "intro": "Thymus diversifolius, commonly known as the variable thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, small, needle-like leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Its leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its strong herbal scent and medicinal properties. Thymus diversifolius is often used in culinary applications and traditional herbal remedies due to its antimicrobial and antifungal attributes."
