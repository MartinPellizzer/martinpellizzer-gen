It features three narrow, lance-shaped leaves and three white petals that are often tinged with pink or red. The plant produces a single, erect stem with a showy white flower that blooms in early spring. It thrives in rich, moist woodlands and is known for its delicate, ephemeral beauty. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
