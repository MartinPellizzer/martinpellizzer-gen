    "intro": "Tydaea picta, commonly known as the painted grass, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Tydaea picta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its distinctive, often variegated foliage that adds visual interest to gardens and natural habitats."
