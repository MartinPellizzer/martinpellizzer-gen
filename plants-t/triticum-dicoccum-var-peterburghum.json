    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum var. peterburghum, commonly known as Canadian amber wheat, is a variety of emmer wheat native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its hulled grains, which are retained on the plant until maturity, distinguishing it from modern hulled and hull-less wheat varieties. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with long, slender spikes that bear small, hard grains. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its botanical features make it a valuable crop for traditional and heritage agricultural practices."
