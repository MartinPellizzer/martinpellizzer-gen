    "intro": "Tithymalopsis ipecacuanhae f. orbiculata, commonly known as the orbiculate tithymalopsis, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its distinctive orbicular (circle-shaped) leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. Its botanical features make it of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its limited distribution and ornamental value. However, it is threatened by habitat loss and is considered a species of conservation concern."
