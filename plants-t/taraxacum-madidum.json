    "intro": "Taraxacum madidum, commonly known as the wetland dandelion, is a perennial herb native to moist habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, hairless stem that is often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its flowers develop into a spherical, prickly seed head known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Taraxacum madidum is adapted to wet, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks."
