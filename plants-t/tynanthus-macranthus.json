    "intro": "Tynanthus macranthus, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, and it produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture. Tynanthus macranthus plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
