It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silky texture. Tecoma lepidota is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm, sunny climates."
