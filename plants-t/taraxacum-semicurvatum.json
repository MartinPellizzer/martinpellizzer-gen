    "intro": "Taraxacum semicurvatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, upright stem that bears a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, stem-like structure that supports its yellow composite flower, which develops into a ball of white, fluffy seeds. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. This species is similar to other dandelions but can be distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and flowering structure."
