It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
