    "intro": "Tecticornia undulata, commonly known as the undulating glassworts, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in saline or coastal soils and is often found in dunes or salt marshes. Tecticornia undulata plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is of interest for its potential in phytoremediation."
