    "intro": "Tunica saxifraga f. rigida, commonly known as the rigid rock saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe. It is characterized by its compact, succulent-like growth habit and fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, typically in clusters at the tips of the stems. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, thriving in poor soils and full sun exposure. Due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
