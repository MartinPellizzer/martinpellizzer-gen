    "intro": "Teramnus axilliflorus, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, often branched stems and palmate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Teramnus axilliflorus is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks."
