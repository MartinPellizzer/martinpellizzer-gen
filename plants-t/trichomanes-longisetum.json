    "intro": "Trichomanes longisetum, commonly known as the long-hair maidenhair fern, is a delicate and ancient fern species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are covered with small, hair-like structures called trichomes, which help reduce water loss. Trichomanes longisetum is notable for its intricate spore-producing structures, known as sori, which are clustered on the underside of its fronds."
