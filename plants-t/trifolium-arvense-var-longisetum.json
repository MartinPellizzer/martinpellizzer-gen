    "intro": "Trifolium arvense var. longisetum, commonly known as the long-hairy clover, is a variant of the common clover species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, typically with three oval-shaped leaflets, and is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, and its stems are often covered in long, stiff hairs, giving it its common name. It is a hardy perennial that thrives in temperate climates and is sometimes used in agricultural settings for soil stabilization. Its botanical features make it an important plant in ecological and horticultural contexts."
