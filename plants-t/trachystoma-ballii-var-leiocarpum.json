    "intro": "Trachystoma ballii var. leiocarpum, commonly known as the smooth-capsuled trachystoma, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often covered with fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped. The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom during the cooler months. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers."
