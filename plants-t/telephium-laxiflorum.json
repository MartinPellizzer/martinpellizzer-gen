It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically succulent and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it retain moisture in dry conditions.
