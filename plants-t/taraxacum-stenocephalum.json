    "intro": "Taraxacum stenocephalum, commonly known as the narrow-headed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, inconspicuous flower head that produces a capsule containing numerous seeds. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, often growing in disturbed soils and open habitats. It has a hairy stem and leaves with a rough texture, typical of many dandelion species. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its wide distribution and adaptability."
