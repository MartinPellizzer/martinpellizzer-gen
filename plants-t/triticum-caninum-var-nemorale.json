    "intro": "Triticum caninum var. nemorale, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild cereal grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and spike-like inflorescence composed of small, awned glumes. The plant produces awned lemmas and paleas, which are typical features of the Poaceae family. It is often found in dry, disturbed soils and can thrive in marginal habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
