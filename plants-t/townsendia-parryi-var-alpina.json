    "intro": "Townsendia parryi var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine townsendia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its delicate, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellow to orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species, often found in isolated locations across the Sierra Nevada and other mountain ranges."
