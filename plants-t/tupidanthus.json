    "intro": "Tupidanthus, commonly known as the Brazilian candlewood, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and large, palmate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Tupidanthus species produce showy, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to habitat loss, several species within this genus are now considered endangered."
