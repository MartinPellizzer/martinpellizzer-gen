    "intro": "Trichomanes tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender fern, is a small evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its simple structure and low-growing habit make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
