    "intro": "Thunbergia quadrialata, commonly known as the four-leaf thunbergia, is a climbing plant native to tropical Africa. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often adorned with a silver or white midrib, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces fragrant, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and support for its vine-like growth. Thunbergia quadrialata is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and as a houseplant."
