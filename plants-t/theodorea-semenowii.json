    "intro": "Theodorea semenowii, commonly known as the Semenowii lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Theodorea semenowii is considered a vulnerable species."
