    "intro": "Trichocereus chiloensis var. australis, commonly known as the Southern Chilo\u00e9 cactus, is a species native to southern Chile. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, dark green stems that often develop a reddish tinge when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the axils of the stems. It is adapted to grow in arid and semi-arid environments, with a preference for well-draining soils. This variety is also noted for its slow growth rate and ability to thrive in coastal regions with moderate temperatures."
