    "intro": "Trichosorus, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in early summer. The plant is native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. Trichosorus species are often found in open habitats such as meadows and tundra, and they are adapted to cold climates. Its hairy leaves help reduce water loss, making it well-suited for harsh environmental conditions."
