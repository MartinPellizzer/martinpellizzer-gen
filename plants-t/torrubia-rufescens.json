    "intro": "Torrubia rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed willow, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrublands and coastal areas. The plant has slender, reddish stems that become woody with age, and its leaves are narrow and often have a grayish or whitish underside. It produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins during the spring, which are wind-pollinated. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
