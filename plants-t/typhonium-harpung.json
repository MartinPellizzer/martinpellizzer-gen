    "intro": "Typhonium harpung, commonly known as the harpoon arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces a striking inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of many aroid species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its name is derived from the spiky, harpoon-like structures on its underground tubers, which can be toxic."
