    "intro": "Tanacetum canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf tansy, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Tanacetum canescens is also valued for its aromatic properties and historical use in herbal medicine."
