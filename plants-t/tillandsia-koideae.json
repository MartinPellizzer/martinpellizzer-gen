    "intro": "Tillandsia koideae, commonly known as the Koide's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant possesses a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale pink. Tillandsia koideae is well adapted to humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
