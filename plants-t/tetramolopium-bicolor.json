    "intro": "Tetramolopium bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant is distinguished by its bi-colored foliage, with upper leaves often displaying a silvery-blue hue and lower leaves being more green. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Tetramolopium bicolor is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
