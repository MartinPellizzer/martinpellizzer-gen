    "intro": "Thalictrum coriaceum, commonly known as the rough meadow-rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and fern-like, compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are typically less showy than the foliage. Thalictrum coriaceum prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and native garden cultivation."
