    "intro": "Tragacantha caprina, commonly known as goat's rue, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow pea-like flowers. The plant produces a distinctive resinous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a food additive. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and scrublands. Tragacantha caprina is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and preventing soil erosion."
