    "intro": "Thesium nevadense, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada thesium, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, rocky habitats. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its alpine environment. Thesium nevadense is considered a rare and endemic species, with limited distribution and specific ecological requirements."
