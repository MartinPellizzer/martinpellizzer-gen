    "intro": "Tillandsia lescaillei, commonly known as the Lescaille's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to trap moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of white or pale pink. Due to its unique growth habits and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and botanical collections."
