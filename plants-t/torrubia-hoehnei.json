    "intro": "Torrubia hoehnei, commonly known as the Hoehne's torrubia, is a rare shrub native to the cloud forests of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
