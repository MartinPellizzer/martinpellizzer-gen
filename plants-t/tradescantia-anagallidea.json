    "intro": "Tradescantia anagallidea, commonly known as the red-veined nettle, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to South America. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The leaves are lance-shaped with distinctive red veins, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments."
