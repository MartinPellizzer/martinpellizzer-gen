    "intro": "Tillandsia caraguata, commonly known as the Caragu\u00e1 air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia caraguata is often cultivated as a decorative air plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
