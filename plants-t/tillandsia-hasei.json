    "intro": "Tillandsia hasei, commonly known as the Hasei air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces striking, orchid-like inflorescences with vibrant purple and white flowers. Tillandsia hasei is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
