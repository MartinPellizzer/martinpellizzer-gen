    "intro": "Tristemma littorale subsp. littorale, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a coastal plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows near the shoreline, where it can tolerate salt spray and sandy soils. The plant has showy, five-petaled flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming throughout the growing season. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The species is well adapted to maritime environments, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
