It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
