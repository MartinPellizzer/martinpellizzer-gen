    "intro": "Thalictrum dioicum var. stipitatum, commonly known as the slender meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to moist meadows and woodlands in North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are alternate and finely divided, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on tall, slender stems. It is dioecious, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
