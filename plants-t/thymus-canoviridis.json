    "intro": "Thymus canoviridis, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically gray-green in color and emit a strong thyme scent when crushed. The plant produces tiny pink or white flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in a variety of climates, including coastal areas."
