    "intro": "Tillandsia supermexicana, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a type of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forests or on tree trunks. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
