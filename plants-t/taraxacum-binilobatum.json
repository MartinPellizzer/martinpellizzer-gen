    "intro": "Taraxacum binilobatum, commonly known as the two-lobed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, typical of the genus Taraxacum. It produces a distinctive seed head composed of parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. This plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils."
