    "intro": "Thalictrum rariflorum, commonly known as the slender meadow rue, is a herbaceous plant native to moist woodlands and stream banks in eastern North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and has a fibrous root system. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is often found in shaded, moist environments. Thalictrum rariflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in natural habitats."
