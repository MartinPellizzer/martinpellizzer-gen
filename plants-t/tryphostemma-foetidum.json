It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are typically ovate with a rough texture, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
