    "intro": "Thelypteris patens var. dissimilis, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with sporangia clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds."
