    "intro": "Torilis rubella f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender false dandelion, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while the flowers are small and yellow, forming a cluster at the top of the stem. This variant is distinguished by its more delicate and slender structure compared to the typical form of Torilis rubella."
