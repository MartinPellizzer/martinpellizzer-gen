    "intro": "Thymus crebrifolius, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, aromatic leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces tiny pink to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it ideal for ground cover in rock gardens or between paving stones. Thymus crebrifolius is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
