    "intro": "Trifolium echinatum var. brevidens, commonly known as the short-stemmed clover, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained conditions. It is often found in alpine meadows and open woodlands, where it contributes to soil stabilization and supports local pollinator populations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
