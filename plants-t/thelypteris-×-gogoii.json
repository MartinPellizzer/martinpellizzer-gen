    "intro": "Thelypteris \u00d7 gogoii, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between *Thelypteris jamaicensis* and *Thelypteris truncata*. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its lanceolate, serrated fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The fronds are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded garden settings."
