It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and herbaceous growth habit. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, pale green leaves with a hairy underside. Its yellow flower heads produce seeds with pappus, enabling wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides."
