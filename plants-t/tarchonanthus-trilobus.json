It is characterized by its dense, golden-yellow foliage and small, tubular flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with small, leathery leaves that reduce water loss. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
