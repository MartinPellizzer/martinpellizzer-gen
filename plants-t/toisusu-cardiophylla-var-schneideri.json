    "intro": "Toisusu cardiophylla var. schneideri, commonly known as the Schneider's heart-leaf plant, is a rare and ornamental species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. Its foliage is highly sought after for its aesthetic value in horticulture, though it requires specific care to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its natural habitat."
