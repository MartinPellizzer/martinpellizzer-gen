    "intro": "Trichocentrum plectrophora, commonly known as the hairy-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Trichocentrum plectrophora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
