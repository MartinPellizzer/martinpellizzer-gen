It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are often a deep green with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
