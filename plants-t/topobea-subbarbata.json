    "intro": "Topobea subbarbata, commonly known as the hairy false heather, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Topobea subbarbata is often found in rocky soils and open woodlands, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
