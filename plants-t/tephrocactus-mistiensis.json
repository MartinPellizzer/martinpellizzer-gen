    "intro": "Tephrocactus mistiensis, commonly known as the Misti cactus, is a species native to the Andes Mountains of Peru. It is a small, columnar cactus with a distinctive ribbed structure and spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
