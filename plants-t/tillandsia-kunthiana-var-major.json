    "intro": "Tillandsia kunthiana var. major, commonly known as the giant air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, sword-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a waxy coating. The plant is able to absorb moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through roots, making it well adapted to its natural habitat. It produces striking inflorescences with showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. This variety is popular among plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
