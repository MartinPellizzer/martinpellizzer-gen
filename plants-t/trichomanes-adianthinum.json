    "intro": "Trichomanes adianthinum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in rocky, shaded environments. It has delicate, narrow leaves that form dense, mat-like growths on the ground. The plant's rhizomes are creeping and often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. It is typically found in moist, temperate regions with well-drained soil. Trichomanes adianthinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
