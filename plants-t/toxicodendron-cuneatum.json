    "intro": "Toxicodendron cuneatum, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed poison ivy, is a flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family. It is native to parts of South America and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. Due to its allergenic properties, it is often avoided or treated with caution in natural environments."
