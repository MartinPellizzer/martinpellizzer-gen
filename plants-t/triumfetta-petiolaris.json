It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically white or pink, with five petals and a prominent central stigma. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Triumfetta petiolaris is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of light conditions."
