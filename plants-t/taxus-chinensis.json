    "intro": "Taxus chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen tree or shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves and reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, flaky layers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds. Taxus chinensis is known for containing taxine alkaloids, which have significant medicinal value, particularly in cancer treatments. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and longevity."
