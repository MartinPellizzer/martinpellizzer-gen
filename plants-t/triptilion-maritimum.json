    "intro": "Triptilion maritimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiky, blue or purple flower heads surrounded by bracts that resemble leaves. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shores and dunes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Triptilion maritimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal environments."
