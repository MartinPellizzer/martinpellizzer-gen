    "intro": "Taraxacum acuminatum, commonly known as the sharp-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrowly lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces a single, hollow, stem that supports a yellow flower head composed of many small florets. After flowering, it develops a distinctive seed head with white, feathery seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. It is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils."
