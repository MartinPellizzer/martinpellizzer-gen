    "intro": "Tillandsia dianthoidea, commonly known as the silver vernal, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it blooms in the spring or early summer. Tillandsia dianthoidea is popular as a decorative plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
