    "intro": "Trifolium kingii subsp. kingii, commonly known as King's clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring, typically in clusters at the ends of stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grassy areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
