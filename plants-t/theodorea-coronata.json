    "intro": "Theodorea coronata, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in landscaping and restoration projects. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to a variety of soil types. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
