    "intro": "Tiarella laciniata, commonly known as the fragrant tiarella, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features delicate, fern-like foliage with finely divided leaves that create a lush, carpet-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which emit a subtle, sweet fragrance. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in woodland gardens for its ornamental value. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ground cover in shaded landscapes."
