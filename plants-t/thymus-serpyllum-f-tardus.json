    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. tardus, commonly known as the late flowering thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, and it produces pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, and it is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is particularly noted for its delayed flowering compared to other thyme species, making it a valuable addition to gardens seeking extended blooming periods."
