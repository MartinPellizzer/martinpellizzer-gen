    "intro": "Taraxacum pachypodum, commonly known as the African dandelion, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces a tall, hairy stem topped with a single, bright yellow flower that blooms in the summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a fluffy pappus, similar to other dandelions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in drought-prone regions."
