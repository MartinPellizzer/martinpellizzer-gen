    "intro": "Thulinia albolutea, commonly known as the white-flowered thulinia, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, white, umbellate flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often tinged with a pale green hue. Native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and aesthetic appeal, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
