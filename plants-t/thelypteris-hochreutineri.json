    "intro": "Thelypteris hochreutineri, commonly known as the Hochreutiner's shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread across forest floors. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. Thelypteris hochreutineri thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
