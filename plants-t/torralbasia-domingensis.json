    "intro": "Torralbasia domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single, tall flower spike with showy, violet-colored blooms. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
