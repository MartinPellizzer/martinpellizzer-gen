    "intro": "Triumfetta calycina, commonly known as the velvetleaf or African velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is an annual herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, dry fruits called capsules, which contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture, and the plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Triumfetta calycina is also noted for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
