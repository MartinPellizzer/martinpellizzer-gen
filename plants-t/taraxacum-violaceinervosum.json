    "intro": "Taraxacum violaceinervosum, commonly known as the violet-veined dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, typically found in grasslands and open woodlands. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of deeply lobed, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. Its flowers produce achene fruits with pappus structures, aiding in wind dispersal. The species is notable for its striking violet veins in the leaves, which distinguish it from other dandelion species."
