    "intro": "Triticum squarrosum, commonly known as the rough wheat, is a wild grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. Its seeds are typically small and hard, adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. Triticum squarrosum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
