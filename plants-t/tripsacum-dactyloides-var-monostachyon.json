    "intro": "Tripsacum dactyloides var. monostachyon, commonly known as wild millet, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its coarse, fibrous stalks and small, clustered spikelets that produce seeds. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is highly drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. It has been historically used by indigenous peoples for food and fiber. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration and sustainable agriculture."
