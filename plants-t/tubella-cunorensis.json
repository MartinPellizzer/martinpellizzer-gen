    "intro": "Tubella cunorensis, commonly known as the Cuneiform Tubella, is a species of sea sponge found in marine environments. It belongs to the family Tubellidae and is characterized by its unique, branching structure. The sponge's body is covered in tiny, finger-like projections called spicules, which provide structural support. It is typically found in shallow coastal waters and plays a role in marine ecosystems by filtering plankton from the water. Due to its delicate nature, it is often overlooked in ecological studies despite its importance in benthic habitats."
