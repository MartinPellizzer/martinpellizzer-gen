    "intro": "Thelypteris oligophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and have a finely divided structure. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to the soil. Thelypteris oligophylla is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
