    "intro": "Trifolium plumosum subsp. amplifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are broad and often covered with fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and agricultural settings."
