    "intro": "Tinantia glabra, commonly known as the smooth tinantia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in a cluster, which are followed by round, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Tinantia glabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and modest flowering display."
