    "intro": "Tillandsia fendleri var. fendleri, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. This variety is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
