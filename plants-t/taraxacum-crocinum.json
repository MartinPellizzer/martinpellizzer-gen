    "intro": "Taraxacum crocinum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets and a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this species thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces a hollow, leafless stem that bears a single flower head at the top. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments."
