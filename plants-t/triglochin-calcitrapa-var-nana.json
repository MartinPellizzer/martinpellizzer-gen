    "intro": "Triglochin calcitrapa var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf sea arrowgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal areas of Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in saline or brackish wetlands, often found in tidal zones and salt marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in summer. Its compact growth habit and salt tolerance make it an important component of coastal vegetation. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
