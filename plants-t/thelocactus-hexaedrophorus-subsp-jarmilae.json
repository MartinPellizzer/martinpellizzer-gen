    "intro": "Thelocactus hexaedrophorus subsp. jarmilae, commonly known as the Jarmilae thorned cactus, is a rare and distinctive cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense clusters of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green and blue-gray foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
