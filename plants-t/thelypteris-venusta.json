    "intro": "Thelypteris venusta, commonly known as the golden hakea, is a fern native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces small, yellowish spore cases called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris venusta thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a shade-tolerant, low-maintenance plant."
