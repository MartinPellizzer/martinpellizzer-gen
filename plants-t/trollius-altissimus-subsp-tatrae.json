It features showy, yellow, saucer-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils in alpine meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a waxy surface, and it has a short, sturdy stem. This subspecies is adapted to cold, mountainous climates and is often found in areas with limited sunlight."
