    "intro": "Trisetum flavescens subvar. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple false brome, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green to purple-tinged foliage. The plant produces panicles of small, pale green to golden flowers, which are often tinged with purple, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and pond edges. The subspecies is distinguished by its more pronounced purple coloration compared to the typical form of Trisetum flavescens."
