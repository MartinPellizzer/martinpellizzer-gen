    "intro": "Taraxacum modestum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which develop into the familiar white, fluffy seed heads. It is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resilience to environmental stress."
