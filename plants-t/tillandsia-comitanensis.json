    "intro": "Tillandsia comitanensis, commonly known as the Comitan's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, fibrous roots that help anchor it to its host and absorb moisture from the air. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which aid in water retention and photosynthesis. Tillandsia comitanensis produces striking inflorescences with showy, violet or pink flowers that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds."
