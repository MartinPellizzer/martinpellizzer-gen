    "intro": "Taraxacum zanskarense, commonly known as the Zanskar dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a puffball of seeds with white pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
