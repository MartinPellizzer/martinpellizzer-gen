    "intro": "Tanacetum aromaticum, commonly known as tarragon, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and finely divided, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late summer. Tarragon is valued for its aromatic, slightly anise-like fragrance, which comes from essential oils found in its leaves. It is often used in culinary applications and traditional medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
