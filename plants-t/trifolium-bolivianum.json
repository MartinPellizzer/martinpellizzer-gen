    "intro": "Trifolium bolivianum, commonly known as the Bolivian clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Bolivia, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in early spring. Trifolium bolivianum is a low-growing perennial that thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas and open habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
