    "intro": "Theobroma glaucum, commonly known as the white cocoa tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small evergreen tree that typically grows up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by oval-shaped pods containing sweet, white seeds. These seeds are used in the production of cocoa butter and are also valued for their aromatic properties. Theobroma glaucum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its contribution to the chocolate industry."
