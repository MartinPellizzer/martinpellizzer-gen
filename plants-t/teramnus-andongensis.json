    "intro": "Teramnus andongensis, commonly known as the Andong teramnus, is a flowering plant species native to the Korean Peninsula. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth surface. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain one or two seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
