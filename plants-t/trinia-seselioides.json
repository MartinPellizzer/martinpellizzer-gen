    "intro": "Trinia seselioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved trinia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and often aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Trinia seselioides produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer."
