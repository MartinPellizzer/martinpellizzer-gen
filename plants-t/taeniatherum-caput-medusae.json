    "intro": "Taeniatherum caput-medusae, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has feathery, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-lobed seeds. It is often used in erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its common name derives from the appearance of its flower heads, which resemble a crown."
