    "intro": "Tracaulon multangulare, commonly known as the multi-angled tracaulon, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its distinctive, angular stems that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pale blue and violet, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often curling slightly at the edges. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
