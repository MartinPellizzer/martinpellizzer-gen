    "intro": "Tarenna rwandensis, commonly known as the Rwandan tarenna, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Rwanda. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with dark green, elliptical leaves that have a slightly rough texture. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely consumed. Tarenna rwandensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native habitat."
