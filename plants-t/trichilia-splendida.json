It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other valuable hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and compound leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are small and yellow-green, often clustered in panicles, while the fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. The tree is valued for its hard, heavy wood used in furniture and carving, though it is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
