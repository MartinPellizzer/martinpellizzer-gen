It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow stripes on the culms, which contrast beautifully with its green stems. This plant is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The bamboo has a robust, cylindrical stem with a square cross-section, typical of the Tetragonocalamus genus. It is valued for both its ornamental beauty and its use in traditional crafts and landscaping."
