    "intro": "Thelypteris delicata, commonly known as the delicate shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are typically arching or pendulous. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the forest floor. Thelypteris delicata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
