    "intro": "Taraxacum laevigatum subsp. schroeterianum, commonly known as the Schr\u00f6ter's dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem that becomes fibrous and persists after flowering. It is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The species is notable for its morphological variation and is often confused with other dandelion species due to its similar appearance."
