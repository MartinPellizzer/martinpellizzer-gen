    "intro": "Tectaria palmata var. palmata, commonly known as the broad-leafed tectaria, is a fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive, rugged texture. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or on rocky surfaces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with closely spaced, serrated leaflets that contribute to its ornamental appeal. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are covered in a thick, protective layer."
