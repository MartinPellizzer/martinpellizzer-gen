    "intro": "Thelocactus subterraneus var. zaragosae, commonly known as the Zaragoza underground cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its subterranean growth habit, with most of its structure buried beneath the soil surface. The plant produces a single, short, spiny stem that emerges above ground, and it blooms with white or pale yellow flowers during the spring. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils. This variety is notable for its rarity and is often found in association with other cacti in its native habitat."
