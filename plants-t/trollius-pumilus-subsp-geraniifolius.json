    "intro": "Trollius pumilus subsp. geraniifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved globeflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, forming globe-shaped inflorescences. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form of Trollius pumilus. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
