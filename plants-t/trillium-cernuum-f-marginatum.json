    "intro": "Trillium cernuum f. marginatum, commonly known as the white trillium, is a striking perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features three broad, waxy, white petals that are often edged with a pale green or white margin, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant has three broad, heart-shaped leaves that are also white-veined, contributing to its elegant look. It blooms in early spring, typically from April to May, and produces a single, showy flower that is pollinated by insects. The plant prefers moist, rich soils in shaded woodlands and is an important species in ecological studies due to its role in forest ecosystems."
