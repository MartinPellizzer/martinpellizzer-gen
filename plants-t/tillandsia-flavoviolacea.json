    "intro": "Tillandsia flavoviolacea, commonly known as the violet-flowered air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America. It thrives by absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through soil. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
