    "intro": "Tillandsia bulbosa, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic plant that thrives without soil, attaching itself to trees and other structures. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States and parts of South America. The plant is characterized by its dense, hanging clusters of soft, gray-green filaments that resemble moss. It absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than roots, making it well adapted to humid environments. Despite its appearance, it is not a true moss but a flowering plant with small, inconspicuous flowers."
