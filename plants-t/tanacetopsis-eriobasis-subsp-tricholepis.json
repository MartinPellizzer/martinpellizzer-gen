    "intro": "Tanacetopsis eriobasis subsp. tricholepis, commonly known as the slender tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are linear to lanceolate, with a distinct aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish composite flowers arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized flora species."
