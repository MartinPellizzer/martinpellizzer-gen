    "intro": "Timonius oligophlebius, commonly known as the narrow-leafed timonius, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific alpine habitats. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils and requires a cool, moist environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
