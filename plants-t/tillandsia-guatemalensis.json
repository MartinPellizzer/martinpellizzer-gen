    "intro": "Tillandsia guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding ornamental value. Due to its adaptability and unique appearance, it is popular among succulent and air plant enthusiasts."
