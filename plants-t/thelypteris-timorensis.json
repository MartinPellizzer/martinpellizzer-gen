    "intro": "Thelypteris timorensis, commonly known as the Timor shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the island of Timor in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive shield-shaped base that gives the plant its common name."
