    "intro": "Thuja asplenifolia, commonly known as the laceleaf arborvitae, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery foliage that resembles the shape of a fern, giving it a delicate and ornamental appearance. The plant has scale-like leaves that are arranged in flat, spray-like clusters, and it produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green cones. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes. Thuja asplenifolia is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban conditions and its use in horticultural landscapes for privacy screening and ornamental purposes."
