It features distinctive, spiny, floating fruits that contain edible seeds, which are sometimes used in local cuisines. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically submerged, with a short stalk extending above the water surface. Its flowers are small and yellowish, appearing in clusters, and it reproduces both sexually and through vegetative propagation. Trapa numidica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
