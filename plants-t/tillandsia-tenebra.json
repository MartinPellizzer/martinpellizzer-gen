    "intro": "Tillandsia tenebra, commonly known as the dark tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its unique rosette-shaped leaves that can store water. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage is typically dark green with a metallic sheen, and it produces striking purple or red flowers. Tillandsia tenebra is relatively easy to care for, requiring minimal water and indirect sunlight."
