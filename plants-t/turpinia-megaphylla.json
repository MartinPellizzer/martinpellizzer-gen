It is characterized by its large, ovate, and often lobed leaves that can reach up to 10 inches in length. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by showy red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along streambanks. Turpinia megaphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
