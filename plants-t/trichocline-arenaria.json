    "intro": "Trichocline arenaria, commonly known as the sand trichocline, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its small, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland deserts. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
