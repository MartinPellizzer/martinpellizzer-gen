    "intro": "Terebinthus jonesii, commonly known as the Jones' terebinth, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, deciduous tree characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces a resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic compounds. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
