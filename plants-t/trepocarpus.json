    "intro": "Trepocarpus, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, tree-like appearance with a thick, fibrous root system. The plant's fronds are typically divided into two types: sterile, leafy fronds and fertile, spore-bearing fronds. Trepocarpus thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its botanical significance lies in its ability to form complex, self-sustaining ecosystems on its host."
