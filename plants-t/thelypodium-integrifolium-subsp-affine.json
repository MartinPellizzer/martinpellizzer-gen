    "intro": "Thelypodium integrifolium subsp. affine, commonly known as the smoothleaf thelypodium, is a flowering plant species native to parts of North America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like inflorescences, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes considered a rare or endangered species in certain regions."
