    "intro": "Tectaria seramensis, commonly known as the Seram shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Indonesian island of Seram. The plant is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Tectaria seramensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
