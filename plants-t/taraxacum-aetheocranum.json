    "intro": "Taraxacum aetheocranum, commonly known as the whitehead dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The flower head consists of numerous small, radiating florets that mature into white, fluffy seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. This species is native to southern Europe and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is a perennial plant that thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant."
