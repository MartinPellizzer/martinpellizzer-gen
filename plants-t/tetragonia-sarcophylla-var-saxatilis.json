    "intro": "Tetragonia sarcophylla var. saxatilis, commonly known as the rock purslane, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green or reddish in color, adapted to store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. It is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Its compact growth habit makes it ideal for rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
