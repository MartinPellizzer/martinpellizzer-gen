    "intro": "Taraxacum subarmatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, ridged stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism with a pappus of bristles that allows its seeds to be carried by the wind. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Taraxacum subarmatum is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
