    "intro": "Thelypteris papilio, commonly known as the Papilio fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Thelypteris papilio is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
