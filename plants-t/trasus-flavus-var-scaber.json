    "intro": "Trasus flavus var. scaber, commonly known as the rough golden thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and rough, hairy leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and along roadsides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive silvery-white underside, which helps reflect sunlight. The rough golden thistle is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
