It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense, globular heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and agricultural fields. This variety is valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage crop for livestock."
