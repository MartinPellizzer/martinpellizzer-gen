It is a small, herbaceous annual or perennial shrub characterized by its simple, opposite, and often narrow leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by small, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
