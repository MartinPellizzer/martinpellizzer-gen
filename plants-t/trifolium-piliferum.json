    "intro": "Trifolium piliferum, commonly known as the hairy clover, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Trifolium piliferum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
