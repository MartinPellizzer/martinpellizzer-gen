    "intro": "Tripteris pachypteris, commonly known as the thick-winged cycadeoid, is a prehistoric plant belonging to the order Cycadales. It is characterized by its fern-like fronds and a unique structure resembling a cycad, though it is not a true cycad. The plant thrived during the Mesozoic era, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fossils are often found in sedimentary rock layers, providing important evidence for understanding ancient plant communities. The botanical features of Tripteris pachypteris offer insights into the evolution of early seed plants and their adaptation to ancient climates."
