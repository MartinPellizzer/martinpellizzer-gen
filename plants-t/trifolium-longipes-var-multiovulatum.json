It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, typically composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas or along roadsides. This variety is notable for its reproductive features, including the presence of multiple ovules within its flower structure, which may contribute to its adaptability and genetic diversity."
