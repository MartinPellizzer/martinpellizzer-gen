    "intro": "Tithymalus rothianus, commonly known as the Rothian tithymalus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as schizocarps, which are typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
