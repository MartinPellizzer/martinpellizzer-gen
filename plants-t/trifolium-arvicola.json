    "intro": "Trifolium arvicola, commonly known as alpine clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Trifolium arvicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
