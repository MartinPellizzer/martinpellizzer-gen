    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. vavilovianum, commonly known as the Vavilovian wheat, is a wild relative of modern bread wheat. It is characterized by its robust growth habit and semi-dwarf stature, often found in the steppes of Central Asia. This variety exhibits a range of genetic diversity, making it a valuable resource for wheat improvement programs. Its seeds are typically smaller and less productive compared to cultivated wheat, but it possesses traits such as disease resistance and adaptability to harsh environments. The plant has a complex reproductive system, including both self-pollination and cross-pollination, which contributes to its genetic variability."
