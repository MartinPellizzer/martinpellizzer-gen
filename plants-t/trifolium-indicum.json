It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Trifolium indicum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a useful plant in agricultural settings."
