    "intro": "Trichoscypha mannii, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and broad, ovate leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by dark, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
