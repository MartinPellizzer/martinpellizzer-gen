    "intro": "Tarachia finlaysoniana, commonly known as the Finlayson's tarplant, is a rare and endangered species native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to arid environments and relies on specific soil conditions and limited water availability. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
