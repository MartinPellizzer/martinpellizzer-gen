    "intro": "Typha domingensis var. eudomingensis, commonly known as the giant cattail, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves and a dense, cylindrical inflorescence that contains both male and female flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands that can dominate wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread rapidly, making it an important species in wetland restoration. The plant plays a crucial role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
