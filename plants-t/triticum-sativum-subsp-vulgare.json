    "intro": "Triticum sativum subsp. vulgare, commonly known as common wheat, is a diploid species within the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and awned lemmas, which are typical of the tribe Aveneae. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and has a fibrous root system adapted to temperate climates. Its grains, which develop in the spikelets, are the primary source of wheat flour used in baking and food production. This subspecies is widely cultivated for its high yield and nutritional value, making it a staple crop globally."
