    "intro": "Trifolium andersonii subsp. monoense, commonly known as the Mono Valley clover, is a rare and endemic species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
