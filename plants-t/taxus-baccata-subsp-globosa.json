    "intro": "Taxus baccata subsp. globosa, commonly known as the globe juniper, is a subspecies of the common yew. It is characterized by its spherical shape, which results from the dense clustering of its branches. The plant has dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls of three. Its cones are small and berry-like, containing toxic seeds. This subspecies is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique form and evergreen nature."
