    "intro": "Tristachya chrysothrix, commonly known as the golden beardgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of golden-yellow flowers, which give it its common name. Tristachya chrysothrix thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense clumps make it both aesthetically pleasing and ecologically beneficial in native plant gardens."
