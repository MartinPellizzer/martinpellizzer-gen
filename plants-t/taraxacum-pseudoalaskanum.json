    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudoalaskanum, commonly known as the Alaska dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-elevation regions of Alaska and northern Canada. It features a rosette of thick, hairy, blue-green leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, arid environments. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a distinctive white, fluffy seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine conditions. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of the tundra ecosystem."
