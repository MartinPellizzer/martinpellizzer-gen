    "intro": "Trichocephalus ellipticus, commonly known as the narrow-headed water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its elliptical, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant's flowers are typically small and white or pale yellow, emerging on short stalks above the water. Its roots are anchored in the substrate, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Trichocephalus ellipticus plays a role in water filtration and supports local biodiversity."
