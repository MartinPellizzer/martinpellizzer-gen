    "intro": "Trifolium hirtum, commonly known as hairy clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Trifolium hirtum is a perennial herb that plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
