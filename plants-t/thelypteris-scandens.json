    "intro": "Thelypteris scandens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a vascular fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and long, slender fronds that often climb or trail along the ground. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, ovate to lanceolate pinnae that are arranged in a dense, feathery pattern. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of the fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. Thelypteris scandens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests, stream banks, and rocky areas."
