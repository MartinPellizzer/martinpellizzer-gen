    "intro": "Terpsichore heteromorpha, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and its clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowering stems are often curved, and the flowers are arranged in a loose, spiraling pattern. Terpsichore heteromorpha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
