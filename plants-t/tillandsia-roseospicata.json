    "intro": "Tillandsia roseospicata, commonly known as the rose-spiked air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage forms a rosette structure that collects water and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking pink or red inflorescences that bloom from the center of the rosette. It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
