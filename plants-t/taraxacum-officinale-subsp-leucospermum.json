    "intro": "Taraxacum officinale subsp. leucospermum, commonly known as the white-rayed dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flower heads with white ray florets, which distinguish it from other dandelion species. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, hairless stem that grows upright, often with a milky sap. Its leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette and are usually deeply lobed. This subspecies is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open areas."
