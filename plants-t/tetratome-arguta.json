    "intro": "Tetratome arguta, commonly known as the sharp-lobed holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves with serrated margins and a waxy, glossy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Tetratome arguta is valued in landscaping for its dense growth habit and ornamental winter form. Its botanical features make it a hardy and adaptable plant suitable for various garden conditions."
