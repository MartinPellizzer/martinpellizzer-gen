    "intro": "Trifolium alpicola, commonly known as the alpine clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Trifolium alpicola is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
