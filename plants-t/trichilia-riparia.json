    "intro": "Trichilia riparia, commonly known as the river trichilia, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other economically important hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, often dispersed by wind or water. Trichilia riparia is often found growing near rivers and streams, contributing to the ecological stability of riparian zones."
