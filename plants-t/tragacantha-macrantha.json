    "intro": "Tragacantha macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, showy yellow flowers. The plant produces a sticky, resinous gum that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a thickening agent. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets, and it typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The species is valued for both its ecological role and its economic potential in the gum trade."
