    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. ammophilus, commonly known as the sand thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to sandy and coastal environments. It features small, dark green, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces compact clusters of tiny, pale pink to white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or coastal gardens. Its aromatic foliage and ability to stabilize sandy soils make it a valuable plant in ecological and horticultural contexts."
