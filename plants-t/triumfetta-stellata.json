    "intro": "Triumfetta stellata, commonly known as the starleaf triumfetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, often appearing in summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Triumfetta stellata is often found in disturbed habitats, such as roadsides and open woodlands, and is adapted to thrive in poor soils."
