    "intro": "Tragacantha tmolea, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Iran and Afghanistan. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and woody, thorny stems. The plant produces a valuable gum resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its adaptations to harsh environments include deep root systems and the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, enhancing soil fertility. Tragacantha tmolea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing desert soils and supporting local biodiversity."
