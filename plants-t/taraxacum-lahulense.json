    "intro": "Taraxacum lahulense, commonly known as the Lahul hill dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in India and Nepal. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow flower heads and basal rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
