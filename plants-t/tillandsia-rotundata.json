    "intro": "Tillandsia rotundata, commonly known as the silver vase bromeliad, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, silver-green leaves that form a vase-like structure, which collects water and nutrients from the environment. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are covered in fine trichomes that help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia rotundata is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
