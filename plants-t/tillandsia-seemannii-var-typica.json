    "intro": "Tillandsia seemannii var. typica, commonly known as the silver pine tillandsia, is a bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette shape, often covered in a silvery-white coating. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive pink or red hue. This species is popular in horticulture due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
