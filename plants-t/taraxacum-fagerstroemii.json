    "intro": "Taraxacum fagerstroemii, commonly known as the Fagerstr\u00f6m's dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and northern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a hollow, wind-dispersed seed capsule. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
