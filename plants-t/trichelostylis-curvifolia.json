The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense clusters, contributing to its unique appearance. Trichelostylis curvifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
