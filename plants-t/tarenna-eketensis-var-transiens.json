    "intro": "Tarenna eketensis var. transiens, commonly known as the Transient Tarenna, is a rare tropical plant native to specific regions of West Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by berries that change color as they mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is of interest to researchers studying plant diversity in tropical ecosystems."
