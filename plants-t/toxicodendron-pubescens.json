    "intro": "Toxicodendron pubescens, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and compound leaves that turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds. It contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
