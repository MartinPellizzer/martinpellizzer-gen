    "intro": "Taxus baccata f. repandens, commonly known as the spreading yew, is a horticultural form of the European yew. It is characterized by its broad, spreading growth habit, which differs from the more upright form of the typical Taxus baccata. The leaves are dark green, elongated, and have a leathery texture, typical of the yew genus. It produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. This form is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, evergreen shrubs or small trees."
