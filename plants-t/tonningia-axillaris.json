    "intro": "Tonningia axillaris, commonly known as the climbing mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are often dispersed by birds. It is an important component of forest ecosystems, providing food for various wildlife species. Its parasitic nature and unique growth habit make it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
