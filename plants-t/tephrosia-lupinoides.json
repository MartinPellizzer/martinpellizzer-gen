It is characterized by its erect, often branched stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to blue or purple, depending on the species. Its pods are typically slender and contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Tephrosia lupinoides is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment and sustainable agriculture."
