    "intro": "Taraxacum cariciphilum, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its leaves are typically covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions. The species is known for its resilience to harsh climatic conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
