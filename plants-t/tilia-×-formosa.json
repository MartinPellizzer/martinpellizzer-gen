    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 formosa, commonly known as the American linden, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to North America. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The tree produces small, round fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Tilia \u00d7 formosa is often planted for its ornamental value and as a source of honey due to its nectar-rich flowers."
