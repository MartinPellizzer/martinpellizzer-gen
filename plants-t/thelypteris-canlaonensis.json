It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. The leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, finely divided structure that contributes to its ornamental appeal."
