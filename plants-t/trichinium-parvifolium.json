    "intro": "Trichinium parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaf trichinium, is a herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fibrous roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Trichinium parvifolium thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
