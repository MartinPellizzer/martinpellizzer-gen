    "intro": "Thymus glandulosus, commonly known as woolly thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features small, aromatic leaves covered in fine, white glandular hairs, which give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small pink or purple flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are often used in culinary applications due to their pungent, minty aroma. Thymus glandulosus is well adapted to rocky and dry environments, making it a hardy ornamental and medicinal plant."
