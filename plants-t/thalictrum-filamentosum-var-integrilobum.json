    "intro": "Thalictrum filamentosum var. integrilobum, commonly known as the silky avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves with a soft, hairy texture, and its flowers are typically white or pale green, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, undivided leaf lobes, setting it apart from other varieties of Thalictrum."
