    "intro": "Trifolium ligusticum, commonly known as Italian clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. Trifolium ligusticum is valued for its nitrogen-fixing abilities, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
