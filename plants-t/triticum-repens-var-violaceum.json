    "intro": "Triticum repens var. violaceum, commonly known as blue meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its slender, creeping growth habit and blue-green foliage. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically green or purple in color, contributing to its ornamental value. It is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ground cover due to its dense root system. The variety violaceum is distinguished by its distinctive violet or bluish tinge in the leaves and inflorescences."
