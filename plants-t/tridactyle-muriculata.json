    "intro": "Tridactyle muriculata, commonly known as the spiny sea hare, is a marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Aplysiidae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny mantle and a soft, gelatinous body covered in a network of tiny, protruding papillae. The species is found in tropical and subtropical waters, often inhabiting shallow coastal areas and seagrass beds. Its coloration can vary, typically featuring a combination of brown, green, and white markings. Tridactyle muriculata plays a role in marine ecosystems by grazing on algae and contributing to nutrient cycling."
