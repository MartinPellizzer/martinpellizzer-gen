It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and distinctive, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It produces a fluffy seed head that disperses seeds via the wind, a common adaptation in the Asteraceae family. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
