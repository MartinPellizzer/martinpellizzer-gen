    "intro": "Triolena pluvialis, commonly known as the rain-loving violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist woodland areas in eastern North America. It features erect stems that bear clusters of small, violet-blue flowers with yellow centers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped, toothed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires consistently damp soil to flourish. Triolena pluvialis is an important nectar source for pollinators and is valued for its ornamental beauty in shaded garden settings."
