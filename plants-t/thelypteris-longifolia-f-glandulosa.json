    "intro": "Thelypteris longifolia f. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular fern, is a fern species belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered with small, glandular dots, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while the fronds are bioluminescent in some varieties, contributing to its ecological role. This fern is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
