    "intro": "Tragiopsis fruticulosa, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a shrub-like species that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Tragiopsis fruticulosa is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy coastal plant."
