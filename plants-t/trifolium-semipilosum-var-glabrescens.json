    "intro": "Trifolium semipilosum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous hairy vetch, is a variant of the hairy vetch species native to certain regions of Europe. It is a leguminous plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy in the wild form but become glabrous in this variety. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. This variety is valued for its potential in ecological restoration and as a nitrogen-fixing cover crop."
