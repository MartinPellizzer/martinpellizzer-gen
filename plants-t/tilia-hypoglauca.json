    "intro": "Tilia hypoglauca, commonly known as the white-barked linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are highly fragrant. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Tilia hypoglauca is often valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
