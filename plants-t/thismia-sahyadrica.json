    "intro": "Thismia sahyadrica, commonly known as the Sahyadri Thismia, is an unusual plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant produces small, white, flower-like structures that are not true flowers but serve as attractive structures for pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within dense forests. Due to its specialized growth requirements, it is considered rare and is often found in specific microhabitats."
