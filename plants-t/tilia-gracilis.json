    "intro": "Tilia gracilis, commonly known as the slender linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically oval or lance-shaped. The tree produces small, fragrant yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its heart-shaped leaves turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value. Tilia gracilis is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is also valued for its timber and historical use in traditional medicine."
