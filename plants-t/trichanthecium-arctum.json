    "intro": "Trichanthecium arctum, commonly known as the Arctic trichanthecium, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapting to the harsh, cold environments of its habitat. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Trichanthecium arctum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife in its polar ecosystem."
