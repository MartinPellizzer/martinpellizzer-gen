    "intro": "Tinus affinis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. The species is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional medicine."
