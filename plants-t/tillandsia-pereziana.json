    "intro": "Tillandsia pereziana, commonly known as the Peruvian air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces striking red or purple flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
