    "intro": "Thymus boissieri var. viridis, commonly known as green thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, fragrant leaves that are often used in cooking. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in spring, which attract pollinators such as bees. Its leaves contain essential oils rich in thymol, contributing to its strong aromatic profile. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and dry climates due to its drought tolerance and hardiness."
