    "intro": "Trichomanes pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf moonwort, is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in cool, moist environments. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, forested areas, often on rocky or humus-rich substrates. Its spores are released in a unique, cup-like structure called a sorus, which is clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
