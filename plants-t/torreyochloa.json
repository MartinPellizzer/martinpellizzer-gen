    "intro": "Torreyochloa, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a genus of grasses native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Torreyochloa is well adapted to arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions. Its ecological importance includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing desert soils."
