    "intro": "Trifolium helleri, commonly known as Heller's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to southern South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Trifolium helleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
