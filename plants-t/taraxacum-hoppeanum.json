    "intro": "Taraxacum hoppeanum, commonly known as the Hoppe's dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that bears a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, typical of the Compositae family. It produces a distinctive seed head with pappus that aids in wind dispersal. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is relatively widespread in temperate regions."
