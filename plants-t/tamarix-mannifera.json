    "intro": "Tamarix mannifera, commonly known as the Mediterranean tamarisk, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces pink or reddish flowers in summer, which are clustered in elongated inflorescences. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in sandy or saline soils. Tamarix mannifera is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize coastal or desert soils."
