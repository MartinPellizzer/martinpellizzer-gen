    "intro": "Tillandsia itatiaiae, commonly known as the Itatiaia air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flower bracts that can last for several months, adding ornamental value. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
