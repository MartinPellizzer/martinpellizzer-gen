    "intro": "Trichodium neglectum, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with small, trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the early morning. The plant has slender, branching stems and hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically pale blue or white, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Trichodium neglectum is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and can withstand high temperatures and low rainfall."
