    "intro": "Taraxacum omissum, commonly known as the Mexican dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single flower head. Its yellow ray florets are surrounded by tubular disk florets, which develop into seeds with feathery parachutes. Taraxacum omissum is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
