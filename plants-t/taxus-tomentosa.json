    "intro": "Taxus tomentosa, commonly known as the European yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and reddish-brown bark that exudes a strong, resinous scent. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are needle-like and arranged spirally along the branches, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Taxus tomentosa is also valued for its ability to thrive in shaded environments and its historical use in traditional medicine."
