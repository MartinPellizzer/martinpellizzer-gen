    "intro": "Tillandsia alfredo-laui, commonly known as the Alfredo-Laui air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, high-altitude environments. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with a pale green or white coloration. Tillandsia alfredo-laui is valued for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
