    "intro": "Tacca angustilobata, commonly known as the narrow-lobed taiwan yew, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Taiwan. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. The plant produces striking, umbrella-like inflorescences that are typically green or purple in color, with small, white flowers clustered at the center. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories where it receives indirect sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tacca angustilobata is considered a species of conservation concern."
