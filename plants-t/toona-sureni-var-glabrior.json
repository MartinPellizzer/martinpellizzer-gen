The plant is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. It produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are a food source for various animals. This variant is distinguished by its reduced pubescence compared to the typical form of Toona sureni."
