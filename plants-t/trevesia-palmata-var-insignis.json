It is characterized by its massive, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces large, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
