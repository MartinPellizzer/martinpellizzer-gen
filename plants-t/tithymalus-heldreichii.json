    "intro": "Tithymalus heldreichii, commonly known as the Balkan tithymalus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
