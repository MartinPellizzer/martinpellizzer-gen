    "intro": "Thelypodium greenei, commonly known as the Greene's thelypodium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its botanical features include a slender stem and an umbel-like arrangement of flowers, which are often visited by pollinators. Thelypodium greenei is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
