    "intro": "Tetrorchidium gabonense, commonly known as the Gabon orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the rainforests of Gabon. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a complex arrangement of petals and sepals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
