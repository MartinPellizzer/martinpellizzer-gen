    "intro": "Tofieldia glutinosa subsp. typica, commonly known as sticky tofieldia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, white to pale green flowers in late spring. The plant's leaves are narrow and often covered with a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Tofieldia glutinosa subsp. typica is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants in its native range."
