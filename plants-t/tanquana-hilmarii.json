    "intro": "Tanquana hilmarii, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration. Tanquana hilmarii plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
