    "intro": "Triticum olgae, commonly known as the extinct wild wheat, is a now-lost species of the grass family Poaceae. It was once believed to have been a wild ancestor of modern wheat, though its exact genetic relationship remains uncertain. The plant likely had characteristics similar to other ancient wheat species, such as small, spike-like inflorescences and tough, fibrous grains. Due to its extinction, little is known about its botanical features, and it is primarily studied through historical and archaeological records. Its potential role in the domestication of wheat makes it a subject of interest in plant genetics and evolutionary biology."
