    "intro": "Trimorpha nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada trimorpha, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is known for its hairy stems and leaves. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species, often found in rocky habitats in Nevada and adjacent states."
