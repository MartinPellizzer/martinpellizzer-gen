    "intro": "Trifolium sefinense, commonly known as the Sefin's clover, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in early spring. Trifolium sefinense is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important component of soil enrichment in its native ecosystems."
