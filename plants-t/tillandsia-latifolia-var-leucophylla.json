    "intro": "Tillandsia latifolia var. leucophylla, commonly known as the silver-leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is a epiphytic plant that thrives by absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, rather than through soil. Its leaves are elongated and covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs that aid in water retention and light reflection. The plant produces striking orange to red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It is valued for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
