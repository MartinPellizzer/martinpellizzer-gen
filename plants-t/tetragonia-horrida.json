    "intro": "Tetragonia horrida, commonly known as the desert spinach or sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, leafy shoots that are used in traditional cuisines. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and sustainable gardening in dry climates."
