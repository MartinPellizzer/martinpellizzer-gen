    "intro": "Taraxacum scotostigma, commonly known as the Scottish dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. It produces a capsule containing numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. The botanical features of T. scotostigma make it well adapted to temperate climates and nutrient-poor environments."
