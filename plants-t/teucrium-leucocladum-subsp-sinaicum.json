The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
