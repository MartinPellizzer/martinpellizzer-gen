    "intro": "Taraxacum denudatum, commonly known as the naked dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which produce seeds with fluffy pappus for wind dispersal. This plant is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is often mistaken for other dandelion species but can be distinguished by its reduced leaf structure and habitat preferences."
