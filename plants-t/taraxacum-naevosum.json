    "intro": "Taraxacum naevosum, commonly known as the spotted dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and heart-shaped leaves, which are typically covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its seed heads, which form a distinctive crown of bracts, are adapted for wind dispersal, allowing the plant to spread efficiently. The species is often noted for its pale yellow flowers and the presence of dark spots on its leaves, which give it its common name."
