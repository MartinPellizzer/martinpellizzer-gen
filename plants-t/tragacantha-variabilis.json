    "intro": "Tragacantha variabilis, commonly known as the variable tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its roots are known for producing a viscous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive."
