    "intro": "Tetrapterys aequalis, commonly known as the equal-winged tetrapterys, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves with five lobes, each bearing a distinct vein pattern. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in inflorescences and are followed by capsule fruits that release minute seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
