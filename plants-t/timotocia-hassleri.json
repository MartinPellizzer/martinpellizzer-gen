    "intro": "Timotocia hassleri, commonly known as the Hassler's timotocia, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, branched stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its small white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in compound umbels, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Timotocia hassleri is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
