    "intro": "Triceratostris rhombilabia subsp. tamayoi, commonly known as the Tamayo's rhombilabia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring rhombic-shaped leaves with distinctive labiate (lip-like) structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its flowers are small, clustered, and exhibit a range of colors, including shades of purple and pink, which attract specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
