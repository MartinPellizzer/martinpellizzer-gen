It features dense, fragrant foliage with small, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover. Its aromatic properties make it useful in culinary and medicinal applications."
