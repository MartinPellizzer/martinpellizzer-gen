    "intro": "Taraxacum officinale, commonly known as dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flower head. The flower head produces a cluster of yellow ray florets that mature into a distinctive sphere of white, fluffy seeds. Dandelion is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and is often found in lawns and disturbed areas. It has a long history of use in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb."
