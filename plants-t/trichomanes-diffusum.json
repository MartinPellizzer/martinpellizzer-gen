    "intro": "Trichomanes diffusum, commonly known as the broad fern, is a fern species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Trichomanes diffusum plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and moisture retention."
