    "intro": "Turanecio taraxacifolius var. taraxacifolius, commonly known as the Alpine dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine white hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears a composite flower head composed of yellow ray florets and yellow disk florets. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This species is notable for its ability to tolerate cold climates and its role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
