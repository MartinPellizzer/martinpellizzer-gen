    "intro": "Trautvetteria caroliniensis f. breviloba, commonly known as the Carolina trautvetteria, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, white flowers are clustered in flat-topped umbels, and its leaves are finely divided, giving it a delicate appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
