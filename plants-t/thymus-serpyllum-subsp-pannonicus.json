It features small, narrow leaves and produces tiny, pink to violet flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, making it valuable for both culinary and medicinal uses. This subspecies is closely related to common thyme but exhibits distinct geographic and morphological characteristics."
