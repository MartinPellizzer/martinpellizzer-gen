It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture and a dark green color. This varietal form is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
