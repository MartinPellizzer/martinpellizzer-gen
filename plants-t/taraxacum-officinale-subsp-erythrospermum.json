    "intro": "Taraxacum officinale subsp. erythrospermum, commonly known as the red-seeded dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The most distinctive feature of this subspecies is its bright red seeds, which are enclosed in a pappus of feathery bristles, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and sunny habitats, often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. This plant is valued for its medicinal properties and is also a common weed in agricultural settings."
