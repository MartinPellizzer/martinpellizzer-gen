    "intro": "Turritis multiflora, commonly known as the Mexican bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Turritis multiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
