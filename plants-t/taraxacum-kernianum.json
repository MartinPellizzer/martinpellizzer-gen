    "intro": "Taraxacum kernianum, commonly known as the Kern's dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the western United States and is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, yellow flower head that develops into a hollow, hairless stem topped with a white, fluffy pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Taraxacum kernianum is often mistaken for common dandelions but is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences."
