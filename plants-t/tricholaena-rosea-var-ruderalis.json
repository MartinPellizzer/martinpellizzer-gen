It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its upright growth habit and dense foliage. The leaves are typically lanceolate, with a rough, hairy texture that gives it its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in human-altered environments such as roadsides and abandoned fields. This variant is notable for its adaptability and ability to colonize areas quickly, making it a common pioneer species in ecological succession."
