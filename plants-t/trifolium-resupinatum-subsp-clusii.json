    "intro": "Trifolium resupinatum subsp. clusii, commonly known as the Clusius clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
