    "intro": "Trichomanes fragile, commonly known as the fragile huperborean, is a small, delicate fern native to the northern hemisphere. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous structure with slender, branching fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes fragile is characterized by its finely divided, linear leaves and is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants."
