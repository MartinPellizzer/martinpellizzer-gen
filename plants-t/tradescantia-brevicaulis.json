    "intro": "Tradescantia brevicaulis, commonly known as the compact spiderwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
