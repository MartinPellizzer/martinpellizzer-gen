    "intro": "Tabernaemontana oblongifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf starflower, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the warmer months. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and as a cut flower. However, it is important to note that some species of Tabernaemontana contain toxic alkaloids, so caution is advised when handling or consuming any part of the plant."
