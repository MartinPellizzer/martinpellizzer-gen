    "intro": "Triticum boreale, commonly known as slender wheat, is a species of grass native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant produces minute, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are typically harvested for agricultural use. Triticum boreale is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It is considered an important forage crop in certain regions due to its hardiness and adaptability."
