    "intro": "Thelypteris rosulata, commonly known as the Rosulate Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive rosette-like arrangement of the pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices, where it can absorb the necessary humidity for its growth. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous cover known as a indusium. Thelypteris rosulata is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, partially shaded conditions."
