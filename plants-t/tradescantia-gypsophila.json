    "intro": "Tradescantia gypsophila, commonly known as the gypsum plant, is a species of flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and its ability to thrive in arid, rocky environments. The plant has succulent-like leaves that store water, making it well-adapted to dry conditions. It prefers full sun and well-draining soil, often found growing on limestone or gypsum-rich substrates. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
