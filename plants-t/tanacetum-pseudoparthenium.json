    "intro": "Tanacetum pseudoparthenium, commonly known as tansy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow, button-like flowers and fern-like, deeply lobed leaves. The plant is often found in moist meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. It contains compounds such as thujone, which can be toxic in high concentrations. Its botanical features make it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential weed in certain environments."
