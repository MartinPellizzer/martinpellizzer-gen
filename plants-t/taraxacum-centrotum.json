    "intro": "Taraxacum centrotum, commonly known as the Mexican dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Central America and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in open, sunny habitats. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and lobed, with a central stem that bears a single, bright yellow flower head. Its flowers develop into a spherical seed head, which releases seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. The species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in agricultural areas."
