It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant has a woody stem with thorn-like projections, and its roots form nodules that host nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Titragyne is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
