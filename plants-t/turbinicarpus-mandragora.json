    "intro": "Turbinicarpus mandragora, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, ribbed stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green, spiny appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. Turbinicarpus mandragora is often cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience in harsh environments."
