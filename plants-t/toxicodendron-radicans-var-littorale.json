    "intro": "Toxicodendron radicans var. littorale, commonly known as the coastal poison ivy, is a variant of the broader Toxicodendron radicans species. It is native to the eastern coast of the United States, particularly in wetland and coastal areas. This plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its ability to thrive in moist, sandy soils. Like other members of the genus, it produces a potent urushiol oil that causes skin irritation in many individuals. Its botanical features make it a notable but often problematic plant in its native habitat."
