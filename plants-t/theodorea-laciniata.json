    "intro": "Theodorea laciniata, commonly known as the laceleaf cycad, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, divided, and lace-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a fibrous sheath. Its reproductive structures include large, cone-like strobili, typical of cycads. Theodorea laciniata is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to thrive."
