    "intro": "Tragopogon pratensis f. antherotristis, commonly known as the purple rayed thistle, is a botanical variant of the common goatsbeard. It is characterized by its distinctive purple flowers with elongated ray florets, which set it apart from the typical yellow-flowered form. This plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It thrives in meadows and grasslands, often in moist or well-drained soils. The subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
