    "intro": "Tilia grata, commonly known as the small-leaf lime, is a deciduous tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of other lime species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early summer, followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow fissures. Tilia grata is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance."
