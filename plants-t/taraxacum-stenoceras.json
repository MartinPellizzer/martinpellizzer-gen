    "intro": "Taraxacum stenoceras, commonly known as the narrow-capselled dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of elongated, hairy leaves and a single, upright stem that bears a flower head composed of yellow ray florets. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, spiky seed stem that disperses its seeds via the wind. It is typically found in temperate regions, often in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Taraxacum stenoceras is a perennial herb that thrives in a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant."
