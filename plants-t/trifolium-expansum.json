    "intro": "Trifolium expansum, commonly known as the broad-leaved clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world. Trifolium expansum is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation."
