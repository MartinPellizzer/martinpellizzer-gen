    "intro": "Trevoria glumacea, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while the flowers are small and clustered in spikelets. Trevoria glumacea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
