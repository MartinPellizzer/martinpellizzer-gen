    "intro": "Tipuana tipa, commonly known as the Andean tree or tipuana, is a fast-growing, deciduous tree native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often used in reforestation projects due to its ability to thrive in various soil types and its nitrogen-fixing properties. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice in urban landscaping."
