It is characterized by its large, bright orange to red flower heads that resemble the sun, hence its common name. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and as a nectar source for pollinators. The variety bourgaeana is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form."
