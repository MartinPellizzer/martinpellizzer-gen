    "intro": "Thelypteris zambesiaca, commonly known as the Zambesi shield fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, protective layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures. Thelypteris zambesiaca plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
