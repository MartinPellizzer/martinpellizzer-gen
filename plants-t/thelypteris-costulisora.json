    "intro": "Thelypteris costulisora, commonly known as the narrow-veined shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with closely spaced, parallel veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Thelypteris costulisora is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental foliage in horticulture."
