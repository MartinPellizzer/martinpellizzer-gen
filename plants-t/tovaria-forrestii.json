    "intro": "Tovaria forrestii, commonly known as the Forest's tovaria, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in cloud forests. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, forming a rosette structure that helps collect moisture from the air. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tovaria forrestii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
