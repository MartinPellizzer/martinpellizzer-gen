It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, banana-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in rich, moist soils near rivers or in dense forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Telipogon musaicus is considered an endangered species."
