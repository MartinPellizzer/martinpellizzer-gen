    "intro": "Taraxacum albidum, commonly known as the white dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, yellow-orange stem that supports a single, showy flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk florets, which are typical of the Compositae family. It produces a distinctive, white, fluffy seed head that disperses seeds via the wind. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats across temperate regions."
