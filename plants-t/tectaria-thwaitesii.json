    "intro": "Tectaria thwaitesii, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, supporting the growth of its expansive foliage. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
