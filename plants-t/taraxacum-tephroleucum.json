    "intro": "Taraxacum tephroleucum, commonly known as the white-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of white-veined, pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, tall, hollow stem topped with a spherical seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important member of the Asteraceae family."
