    "intro": "Trichocentrum ionopthalmum, commonly known as the ionophthalmic orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers with striking white petals and yellowish sepals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and pollination mechanism make it an interesting subject for botanical study. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
