    "intro": "Troglophyton, commonly known as the cave lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to subterranean environments. These plants are typically found in caves and rock shelters, where they have adapted to low light conditions. Troglophyton species often exhibit unique morphological traits such as reduced leaves and specialized root systems. They play a vital role in cave ecosystems by providing food for specific insect and fungal species. Due to their fragile habitats, many troglophyton species are threatened by human activity and environmental changes."
