    "intro": "Thelypteris sinodentata, commonly known as the Chinese holly fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. The spores are produced in sori that are arranged along the margins of the fronds."
