    "intro": "Thylachium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Australia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a unique appearance, with long, thin roots and a single, delicate flower that often resembles a ghostly shape. Thylachium thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to habitat destruction and its elusive nature, it is considered a vulnerable species."
