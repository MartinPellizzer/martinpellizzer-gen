    "intro": "Trapa nedoluzhkoi, commonly known as the narrowleaf water chestnut, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves and spiny, spherical fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Trapa nedoluzhkoi plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
