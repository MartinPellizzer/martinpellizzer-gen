    "intro": "Tetrapilus penangianus, commonly known as the Penang mountain fern, is a unique species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, supporting the growth of its compound leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
