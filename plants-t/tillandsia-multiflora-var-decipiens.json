    "intro": "Tillandsia multiflora var. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped inflorescences that are often red or orange in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal soil, making it an ideal candidate for epiphytic growth. Its unique ability to absorb water and nutrients through its leaves makes it well adapted to its natural habitat."
