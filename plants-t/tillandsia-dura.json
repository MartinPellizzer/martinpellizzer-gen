    "intro": "Tillandsia dura, commonly known as the hardy air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has dense, fibrous roots that help anchor it to its host and absorb moisture from the air. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. Tillandsia dura is well adapted to dry and humid environments, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
