    "intro": "Trifolium alexandrinum var. serotinum, commonly known as Alexandrian clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in forage and soil conservation due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
