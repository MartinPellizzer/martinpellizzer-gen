    "intro": "Tilia concinna, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lime, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of other lime species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, round fruits. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. Tilia concinna is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas."
