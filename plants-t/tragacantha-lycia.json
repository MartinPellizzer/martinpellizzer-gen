    "intro": "Tragacantha lycia, commonly known as the Persian gum or Astragalus lycius, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect stems and compound leaves with small, stiff leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by pods containing seeds. It is known for its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often used in traditional medicine. The plant's resin, known as tragacanth, has been historically used as a natural gum and thickening agent."
