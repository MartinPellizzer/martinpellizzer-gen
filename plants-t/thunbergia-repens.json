    "intro": "Thunbergia repens, commonly known as the creeping bluebell, is a trailing perennial vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, and white, often with a yellow throat. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate, with a slightly hairy texture. Thunbergia repens is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and hanging baskets due to its ornamental flowers and easy care requirements."
