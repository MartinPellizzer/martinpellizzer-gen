    "intro": "Thelypteris bangii, commonly known as the Bang's shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, rounded pinnae. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to form dense mats in the undergrowth. Thelypteris bangii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
