    "intro": "Tillandsia klausii, commonly known as the Klausia air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, fibrous roots and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup to collect rainwater. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Tillandsia klausii is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
