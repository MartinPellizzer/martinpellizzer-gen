    "intro": "Trichopyrum intermedium subsp. epiroticum, commonly known as the Epiretic false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the Balkan Peninsula and parts of southern Europe. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and forest edges. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (tufted) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spike-like clusters, which produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is distinguished by its morphological features and ecological preferences, making it an important component of its native ecosystems."
