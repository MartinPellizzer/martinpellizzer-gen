    "intro": "Trifolium pusillum, commonly known as the small clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Trifolium pusillum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
