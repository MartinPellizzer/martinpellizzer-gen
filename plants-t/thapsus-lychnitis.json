    "intro": "Thapsus lychnitis, commonly known as the nightshade or deadly nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves and striking purple or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic but have been historically used in medicine and witchcraft. It thrives in disturbed soils and is native to Europe, parts of Asia, and North Africa. Due to its toxic properties, it requires careful handling and is often associated with mystery and danger in folklore."
