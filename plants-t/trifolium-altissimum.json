    "intro": "Trifolium altissimum, commonly known as the tall clover, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stalk. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in early summer. Trifolium altissimum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It is a member of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
