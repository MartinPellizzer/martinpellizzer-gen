It belongs to the cypress family (Cupressaceae) and is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves. The tree produces small, round cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its foliage is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Thuja funiculata is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic wood."
