It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant has smooth, green leaves and produces a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments.
