    "intro": "Taraxacum solidum, commonly known as the solid dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, prominent flower head. The flowers are typically yellow, consisting of numerous ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus, which aids in its propagation. It is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to temperate climates."
