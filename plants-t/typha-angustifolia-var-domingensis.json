    "intro": "Typha angustifolia var. domingensis, commonly known as the narrowleaf cattail, is a wetland plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a dense, cylindrical flower spike that produces fluffy seeds. This variety thrives in shallow freshwater habitats such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its rhizomes are often used in phytoremediation to absorb pollutants from water."
