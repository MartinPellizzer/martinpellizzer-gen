    "intro": "Tectaria loheri, commonly known as the rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, evergreen fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes often covered in a layer of fine, hairy structures. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of the fronds. Tectaria loheri is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
