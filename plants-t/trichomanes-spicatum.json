    "intro": "Trichomanes spicatum, commonly known as the spike fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in tiny, hair-like structures. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes spicatum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade."
