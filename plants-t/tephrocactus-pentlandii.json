    "intro": "Tephrocactus pentlandii, commonly known as the Mexican nightshade cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to dry environments. Tephrocactus pentlandii is often found growing in rocky soils and is relatively easy to care for in cultivation."
