    "intro": "Trifolium sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian clover, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along the edges of forests, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in early spring, and its trifoliate leaves are characteristic of the clover genus. Siberian clover is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in cooler climates. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
