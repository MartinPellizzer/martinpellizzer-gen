    "intro": "Triodia litoralis, commonly known as the coastal spinifex, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and is well adapted to sandy, saline soils. The plant forms extensive tussocks that stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its propagation across coastal environments. Triodia litoralis plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of coastal ecosystems."
