    "intro": "Tapeinia magellanica, commonly known as the Magellan lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. It belongs to the family Teloschistaceae and is characterized by its crust-like growth form on rock surfaces. The plant thrives in temperate and cold climates, particularly in South America, where it is found in high-altitude regions. Its morphology includes a dark, leathery thallus with a distinct, granular texture. Tapeinia magellanica plays a role in soil formation and provides habitat for microorganisms in its environment."
