    "intro": "Taraxacum oschense, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and a yellow flowering head that produces a pappus of bristles for seed dispersal. Native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in rocky and sandy soils at high altitudes. The plant is adapted to cold climates and has a deep root system that helps it survive harsh winter conditions. Its presence is often an indicator of nutrient-poor, well-drained environments."
