    "intro": "Thalictrum aquilegiifolium var. japonicum, commonly known as Japanese meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to East Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble those of the buttercup. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers in early to mid-summer, which are arranged in a raceme. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value lies in its intricate foliage and subtle floral display, making it a sought-after addition to shady gardens."
