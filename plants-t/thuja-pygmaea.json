    "intro": "Thuja pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf arborvitae, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to western North America. It features a compact, conical shape with scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically less than an inch in diameter. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used as a hedge or specimen plant in gardens."
