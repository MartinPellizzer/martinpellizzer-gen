    "intro": "Trichelostylis asperrima, commonly known as the rough-stemmed screw pine, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Pandanaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that are often rough to the touch. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne on short, hairy pedicels. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense, tangled mats, which help stabilize soil in its natural habitat. Trichelostylis asperrima is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and waterlogged conditions."
