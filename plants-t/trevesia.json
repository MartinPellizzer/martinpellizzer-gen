    "intro": "Trevesia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false nettle, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their palmately lobed leaves and showy, often yellow or red flowers. Trevesia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. The leaves are often hairy and have a rough texture, while the fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature. The genus includes several species, such as Trevesia pinnata, which is known for its ornamental value and ecological importance in its native habitats."
