    "intro": "Tunica saxifraga, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of its stems. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which further reduces water loss. Tunica saxifraga is well adapted to harsh alpine conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species."
