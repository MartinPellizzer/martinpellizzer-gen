    "intro": "Trichilia stellatotomentosa, commonly known as the star-tomentose champa, is a tropical tree native to regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has compound leaves with pinnate arrangement, and its bark is often covered in a dense, woolly layer of fine hairs. It produces woody fruits that contain smooth, oval seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
