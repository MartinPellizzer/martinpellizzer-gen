    "intro": "Toxicodendron delavayi var. quinquejugum, commonly known as the five-lobed poison ivy, is a variant of the poison ivy plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically three-lobed, though the variant name suggests a different leaf structure. The plant contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its allergenic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
