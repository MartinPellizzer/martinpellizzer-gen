    "intro": "Thymus nervosus, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, pink to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its aromatic foliage is often used in culinary and medicinal applications."
