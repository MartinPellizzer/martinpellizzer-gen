    "intro": "Trisetella abbreviata, commonly known as the short-stemmed feather grass, is a small, perennial grass species native to parts of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and along stream banks. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a slight sheen. Trisetella abbreviata is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
