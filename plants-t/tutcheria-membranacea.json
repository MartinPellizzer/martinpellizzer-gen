    "intro": "Tutcheria membranacea, commonly known as the membranous tutcheria, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its delicate, papery leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Tutcheria membranacea is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
