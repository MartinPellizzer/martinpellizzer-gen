    "intro": "Traversia baccharoides, commonly known as the coastal traversia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Traversia baccharoides is well adapted to coastal dunes and is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ecological benefits."
