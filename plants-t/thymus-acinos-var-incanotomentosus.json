    "intro": "Thymus acinos var. incanotomentosus, commonly known as the white-hairy thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, aromatic, gray-green leaves covered in fine, white hairs, which give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale pink to white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
