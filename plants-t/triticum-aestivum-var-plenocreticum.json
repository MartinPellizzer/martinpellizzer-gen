    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. plenocreticum, commonly known as the wheat variety with a high gluten content, is a type of durum wheat characterized by its hard grain and high protein content. This variety is primarily cultivated for its use in producing semolina, which is essential for making pasta and certain types of bread. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, bluish-green leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a tough, protective husk that must be removed during processing. Due to its robust growth and adaptability, it is often grown in temperate climates with well-drained soils."
