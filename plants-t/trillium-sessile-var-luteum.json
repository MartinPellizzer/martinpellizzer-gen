    "intro": "Trillium sessile var. luteum, commonly known as the yellow trillium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its three broad, waxy leaves and a single, showy yellow flower that typically blooms in early spring. The plant prefers shaded, moist woodland habitats and is often found in rich, loamy soils. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and the plant is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered threatened in many regions."
