    "intro": "Taxus baccata var. elegantissima, commonly known as the English yew with elegant foliage, is a variant of the common yew tree. It is characterized by its dense, dark green needles that are longer and more slender than those of the typical Taxus baccata. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is evergreen, retaining its foliage year-round, and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
