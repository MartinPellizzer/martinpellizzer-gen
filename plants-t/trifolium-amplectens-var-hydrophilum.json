    "intro": "Trifolium amplectens var. hydrophilum, commonly known as the water clover, is a variant of the common clover species characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat preference. This plant typically features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, stream banks, and marshy areas, where it can absorb water efficiently through its extensive root system. The plant is known for its small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value. Its botanical structure supports its role in soil stabilization and as a food source for various herbivores."
