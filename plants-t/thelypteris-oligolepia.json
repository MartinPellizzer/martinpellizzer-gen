    "intro": "Thelypteris oligolepia, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a graceful, arching appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. Thelypteris oligolepia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
