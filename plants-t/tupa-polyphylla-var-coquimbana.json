    "intro": "Tupa polyphylla var. coquimbana, commonly known as the Coquimbo tupa, is a rare flowering plant native to Chile. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
