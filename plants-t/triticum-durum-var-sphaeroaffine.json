    "intro": "Triticum durum var. sphaeroaffine, commonly known as durum wheat with spherical affinity, is a variant of durum wheat characterized by its unique grain morphology. This variety exhibits a distinct spherical shape in its grain, which differs from the typical elongated form of standard durum wheat. It is primarily cultivated for its high gluten content, making it ideal for pasta production. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, with narrow leaves and compact spikes. Its botanical features make it an important subject in agricultural research for improving wheat yield and quality."
