It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into fluffy white seed heads, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in sunny, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Taraxacum iberanthum is often found in Mediterranean climates and is adapted to dry, nutrient-poor environments."
