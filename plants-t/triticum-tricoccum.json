    "intro": "Triticum tricoccum, commonly known as wild rye, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, each containing both male and female reproductive structures. Wild rye is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. It is also used in some traditional and modern agricultural practices."
