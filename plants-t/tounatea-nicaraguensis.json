It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in humid lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
