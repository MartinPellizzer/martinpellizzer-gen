    "intro": "Thelypteris paleacea, commonly known as the pale fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine, whitish or pale pubescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are relatively short and often covered with a layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. Thelypteris paleacea is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
