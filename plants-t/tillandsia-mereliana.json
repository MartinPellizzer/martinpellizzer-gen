    "intro": "Tillandsia mereliana, commonly known as the Mereliana air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking floral bracts that range in color from white to pink, often with a reddish tinge. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
