    "intro": "Triticum tenuiculum, commonly known as slender wheat, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, narrow leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence. The plant produces small, two-rowed spikes that bear numerous\u9896 (glumes) and lemma-like structures. It is typically found in dry, rocky soils and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. Due to its genetic similarity to cultivated wheat, it has been studied for its potential role in wheat breeding programs."
