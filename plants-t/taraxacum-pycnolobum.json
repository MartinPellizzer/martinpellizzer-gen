    "intro": "Taraxacum pycnolobum, commonly known as the dense-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a spherical seed ball. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. It is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
