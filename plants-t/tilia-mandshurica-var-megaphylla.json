    "intro": "Tilia mandshurica var. megaphylla, commonly known as the Manchurian linden with large leaves, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are larger than those of the typical Tilia species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
