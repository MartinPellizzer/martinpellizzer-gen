    "intro": "Tephrocactus glomeratus var. inermis, commonly known as the naked cluster cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its lack of spines, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Tephrocactus. The plant features bright green, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring or early summer. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
