    "intro": "Taraxacum subulatum, commonly known as the needleleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces a single, tall, yellow flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are followed by a pappus-equipped seed head, which aids in wind dispersal. Taraxacum subulatum is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
