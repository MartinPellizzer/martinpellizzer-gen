    "intro": "Trichoceros astroglossus, commonly known as the star-tongued orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andes Mountains of South America. This terrestrial orchid is characterized by its unique, star-shaped floral structure, which gives it its common name. It typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
