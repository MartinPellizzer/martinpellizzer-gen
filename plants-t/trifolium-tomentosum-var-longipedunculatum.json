    "intro": "Trifolium tomentosum var. longipedunculatum, commonly known as the hairy clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves and hairy stems. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, and it produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of white or pale pink. Its hairy texture and compact growth habit make it a distinctive and recognizable species within the Trifolium genus."
