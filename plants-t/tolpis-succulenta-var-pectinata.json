    "intro": "Tolpis succulenta var. pectinata, commonly known as the woolly pigmyweed, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pinkish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its stems are typically short and branching, with a compact growth habit. Tolpis succulenta var. pectinata is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils."
