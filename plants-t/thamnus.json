    "intro": "Thamnus, commonly known as goldenweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are typically shrubs or subshrubs, characterized by their small, often hairy leaves and bright yellow flowers. Thamnus species are native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the Mediterranean, North Africa, and parts of Asia. They are adapted to survive in dry conditions with deep root systems and waxy leaves to reduce water loss. Many species are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
