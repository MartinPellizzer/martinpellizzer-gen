    "intro": "Thelypteris gregaria, commonly known as the clustered water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense clusters. Thelypteris gregaria plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
