    "intro": "Thlaspi subapterum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cabbagewort, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as those found in meadows and roadsides. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive leaf shape, with \"subapterum\" referring to its reduced wing-like structures. The plant is often found growing in colonies, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
