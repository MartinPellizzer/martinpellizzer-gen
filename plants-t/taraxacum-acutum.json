    "intro": "Taraxacum acutum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, hairless stem that becomes covered with bracts as the flower matures. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. Taraxacum acutum is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators."
