    "intro": "Trigonella procumbens, commonly known as\u530d\u5310\u91ce\u8c4c\u8c46, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage plant in dryland agriculture."
