    "intro": "Taraxacum brachylepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds with parachute-like structures. It is native to regions of Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Taraxacum brachylepis is a hardy perennial that thrives in temperate climates and is relatively drought-tolerant."
