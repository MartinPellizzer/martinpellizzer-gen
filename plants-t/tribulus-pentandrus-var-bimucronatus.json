It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruits that have two prominent, curved hooks at the ends, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and shrubland habitats. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough, hairy texture. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in loose inflorescences, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
