It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, dark green stems and sparse, spiny areoles. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in arid to semi-arid environments with well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its striking appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by cactus enthusiasts."
