    "intro": "Tetraria circinalis var. usambarensis, commonly known as the Usambara feathergrass, is a grass species native to the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and tufted growth habit, typical of many grasses in the Poaceae family. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane forests and rocky habitats. Its inflorescence consists of dense, cylindrical spikelets that are often adorned with silky hairs. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution within its endemic range."
