    "intro": "Taraxacum diversiflorum, commonly known as the diverseflower dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of elongated, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a white, fluffy pappus for wind dispersal. Native to central and eastern North America, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant is perennial, with a taproot system that allows it to survive through harsh conditions. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, contributing to its role in supporting pollinators."
