    "intro": "Tetraneuris pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf tetraneuris, is a small flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green and hairy, providing a drought-resistant structure. Tetraneuris pygmaea is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
