    "intro": "Tristemma mauritianum var. silvaticum, commonly known as the Mauritius tristemma, is a rare endemic plant native to the island of Mauritius. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within the island's mountainous regions. It is a shrub that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with woody stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
