    "intro": "Tetragonia arbuscula var. linearis, commonly known as the coastal spinach or sea spinach, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically linear or lance-shaped, adapted to retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often followed by edible, spiny capsules containing seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found growing along the edges of coastal dunes and salt marshes. Due to its nutritional value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated as a leafy green vegetable."
