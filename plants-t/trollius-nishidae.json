    "intro": "Trollius nishidae, commonly known as the Nishida's globeflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant features a short, hairy stem that supports a single, globe-shaped inflorescence composed of numerous small, yellowish flowers. Its leaves are typically palmately divided, with lobes that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trollius nishidae is considered a rare and endangered species."
