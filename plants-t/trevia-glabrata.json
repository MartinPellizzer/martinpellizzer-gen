    "intro": "Trevia glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf trevia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming during the rainy season. Trevia glabrata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy."
