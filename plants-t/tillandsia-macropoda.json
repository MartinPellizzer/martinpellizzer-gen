    "intro": "Tillandsia macropoda, commonly known as the large-leaf air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple. It is well adapted to humid environments and can thrive in indirect sunlight."
