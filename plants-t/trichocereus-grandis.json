    "intro": "Trichocereus grandis, commonly known as the Peruvian torch cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a trait common among many cacti adapted to arid environments. Its stems are covered in short, stiff spines, which provide protection from herbivores. Trichocereus grandis is also notable for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
