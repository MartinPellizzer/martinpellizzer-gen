    "intro": "Trifolium arvense var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth field clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and is typically found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
