    "intro": "Trigonospora tenera, commonly known as the slender trigonospora, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trigonospora tenera is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
