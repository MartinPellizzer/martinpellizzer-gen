    "intro": "Tragacantha hartwegii, commonly known as the desert tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, followed by pods containing seeds. Tragacantha hartwegii is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its resilience makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
