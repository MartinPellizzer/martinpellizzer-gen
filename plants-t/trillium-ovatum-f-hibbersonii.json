    "intro": "Trillium ovatum f. hibbersonii, commonly known as the Hibberson's white trillium, is a rare botanical variant of the white trillium native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its pale white petals and three broad, waxy leaves that emerge from a single stem. This form is distinguished by its slightly larger size and more elongated petals compared to the typical species. It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments and is often found in areas with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
