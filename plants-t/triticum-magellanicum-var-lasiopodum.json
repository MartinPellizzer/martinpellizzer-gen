It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. It thrives in temperate climates and is adapted to grow in rocky or disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
