    "intro": "Trichilia macrocarpa, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and alternate, pinnate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its fine grain and durability, making it important in local economies. However, overharvesting has led to its decline in some regions, prompting conservation efforts."
