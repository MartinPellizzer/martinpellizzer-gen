    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. albidum, commonly known as white wheat, is a variant of the common wheat species characterized by its lighter grain color. This variety is typically shorter and more compact than standard wheat, with a lower protein content, which affects its baking properties. The plant produces small, pale grains that are primarily used in the production of certain types of flour and animal feed. It is adapted to a range of climates but thrives in temperate regions with well-drained soils. Due to its lower yield and specific uses, it is less commonly cultivated than other wheat varieties."
