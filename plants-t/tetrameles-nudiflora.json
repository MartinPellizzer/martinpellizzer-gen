    "intro": "Tetrameles nudiflora, commonly known as the naked-flower tetrameles, is a tropical tree native to the islands of the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its smooth, often whitish bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically evergreen. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in axillary clusters, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
