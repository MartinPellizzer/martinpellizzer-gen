    "intro": "Tapeinochilos koordersianus, commonly known as the Koord's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and forest margins. The plant features a slender, upright stem with few leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in late winter or early spring. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence and is often found in association with other orchid species in its native environment. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
