    "intro": "Triniochloa andina, commonly known as the Andean triniochloa, is a grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Triniochloa andina plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in alpine ecosystems."
