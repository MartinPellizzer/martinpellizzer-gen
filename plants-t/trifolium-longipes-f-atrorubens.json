    "intro": "Trifolium longipes f. atrorubens, commonly known as the dark red clover, is a variant of the longipes subspecies of red clover. It is characterized by its distinctive dark red to purplish foliage, which sets it apart from the typical green foliage of other clover varieties. This plant is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. It produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, contributing to its ornamental value. The plant is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage crop for livestock."
