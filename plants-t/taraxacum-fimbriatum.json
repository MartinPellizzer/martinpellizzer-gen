    "intro": "Taraxacum fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, fimbriated leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and disturbed soils. Taraxacum fimbriatum is known for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
