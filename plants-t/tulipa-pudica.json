    "intro": "Tulipa pudica, commonly known as the shy tulip, is a species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in rocky soils and harsh climates, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
