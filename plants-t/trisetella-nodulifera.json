    "intro": "Trisetella nodulifera, commonly known as the nodular liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its thalloid structure, which consists of a flat, ribbon-like body covered in small, rounded lobes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture through its surface. Its reproductive structures, known as gametangia, are borne on specialized stalks called caulocarps. Trisetella nodulifera plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
