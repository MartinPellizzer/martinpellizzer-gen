    "intro": "Tillandsia roezlii, commonly known as the R\u00f6sel's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, narrow leaves that form a rosette shape, creating a water-holding structure at the center. It thrives in humid environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth. Tillandsia roezlii is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
