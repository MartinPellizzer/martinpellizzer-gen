    "intro": "Tirucalia mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritania tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties. Due to its resilience, it is also valued for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
