    "intro": "Toxicodendron laetevirens, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have 11 to 31 leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. However, it contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation in humans."
