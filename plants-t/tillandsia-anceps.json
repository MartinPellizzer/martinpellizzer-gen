    "intro": "Tillandsia anceps, commonly known as the silver vellum tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive silver appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on atmospheric moisture and nutrients. Its rosette-shaped leaves are adapted to trap water and provide a habitat for small organisms. Tillandsia anceps is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
