    "intro": "Trisetum americanum, commonly known as western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in pairs, with three to five bristles on each lemma. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in prairie and steppe ecosystems. Western wheatgrass is valued for its drought tolerance and is used in restoration projects and as a forage crop."
