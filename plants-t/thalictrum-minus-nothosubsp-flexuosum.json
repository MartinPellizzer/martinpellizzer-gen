    "intro": "Thalictrum minus nothosubsp. flexuosum, commonly known as the flexible meadow rue, is a low-growing perennial plant native to certain regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are often flexuous, meaning they are flexible and can bend easily, which helps it adapt to its habitat. This nothosubspecies is a hybrid form, resulting from the cross between T. minus and T. roemerianum, and exhibits unique botanical traits that distinguish it from its parent species."
