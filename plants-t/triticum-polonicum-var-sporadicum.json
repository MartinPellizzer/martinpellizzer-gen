It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides or in agricultural fields. This variety is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its adaptability and role in local ecosystems."
