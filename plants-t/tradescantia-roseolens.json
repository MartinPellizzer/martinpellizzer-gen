    "intro": "Tradescantia roseolens, commonly known as the pink wandering Jew, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and striking pink to purple variegated foliage. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens. Its ability to spread rapidly through runners makes it both ornamental and somewhat invasive in certain environments."
