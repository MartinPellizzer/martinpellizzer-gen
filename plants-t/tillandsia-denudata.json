    "intro": "Tillandsia denudata, commonly known as the naked tillandsia, is a species of air plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to Central and South America, where it typically grows on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle aesthetic to its natural habitat. Due to its unique ability to thrive without soil, it is a popular choice for terrariums and indoor gardening."
