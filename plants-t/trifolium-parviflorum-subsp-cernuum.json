It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a white or pale green coloration. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale blue, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. This species is valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage crop for livestock."
