    "intro": "Trichera macedonica var. lyrophylla, commonly known as the Macedonian trichera, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of North Macedonia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and limited seed viability, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
