    "intro": "Thelypteris conterminoides, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds. Thelypteris conterminoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
