    "intro": "Telipogon guila, commonly known as the Guila orchid, is a rare and unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that display a complex array of colors, often with a mix of white, purple, and pink. This plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its slender stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves are adapted to the shaded conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telipogon guila is considered a vulnerable species."
