    "intro": "Typhonium liliifolium, commonly known as the lace-leaf arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, arrowhead-shaped leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces an inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. Its rhizomes are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines. However, it can be toxic if consumed raw, requiring proper preparation before consumption."
