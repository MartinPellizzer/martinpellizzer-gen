    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. austriacus, commonly known as Austrian thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Central Europe. It features dense, creeping stems that produce small, aromatic leaves with a strong thyme scent. The plant bears pink to lavender flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often used in culinary applications, adding a spicy flavor to dishes. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
