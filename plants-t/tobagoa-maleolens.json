    "intro": "Tobagoa maleolens, commonly known as the Caribbean trumpet vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to the Caribbean region. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental purposes, though it can become invasive if not managed properly. The genus Tobagoa belongs to the Bignoniaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with showy, often tubular flowers."
