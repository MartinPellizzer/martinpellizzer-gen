    "intro": "Tristagma uniflorum f. roseoplenum, commonly known as the rose-purple tristagma, is a variant of the tristagma uniflorum, a species native to the southwestern United States. This cultivar is distinguished by its unique rose-purple foliage, which sets it apart from the typical green leaves of the parent species. The plant is a low-growing shrub with small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments. Its ornamental value lies in its striking leaf color and compact growth habit."
