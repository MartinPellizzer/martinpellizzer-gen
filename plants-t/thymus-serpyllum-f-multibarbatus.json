    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. multibarbatus, commonly known as the multibarbatus thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features small, fragrant leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces pink or purple flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. The variety is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance compared to other thyme species."
