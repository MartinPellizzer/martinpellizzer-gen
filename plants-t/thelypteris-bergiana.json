    "intro": "Thelypteris bergiana, commonly known as the Bergian shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Thelypteris bergiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
