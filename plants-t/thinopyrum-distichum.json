    "intro": "Thinopyrum distichum, commonly known as goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear two-rowed spikelets, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as fields and roadsides. Thinopyrum distichum is also valued for its potential in agricultural research due to its genetic contributions to wheat improvement."
