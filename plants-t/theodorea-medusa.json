    "intro": "Theodorea medusa, commonly known as the sea star flower, is a unique plant species characterized by its star-shaped blooms. It thrives in coastal environments, particularly in sandy soils near the ocean. The plant features waxy, blue-pink petals that resemble the arms of a sea star, giving it its common name. Its flowers are pollinated by wind and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Theodorea medusa is known for its resilience to salt spray and is a symbol of coastal biodiversity."
