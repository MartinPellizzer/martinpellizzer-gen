    "intro": "Tilia houghii, commonly known as Hough's lime, is a deciduous tree native to eastern China. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne in clusters and attract pollinators like bees. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Tilia houghii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
