    "intro": "Trifolium maritimum subsp. xatardii, commonly known as the Xatard's coastal clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically grayish-green and covered in fine hairs, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, demonstrating a high degree of salt tolerance. This subspecies is often found in dune ecosystems, playing a role in stabilizing coastal dunes through its extensive root system."
