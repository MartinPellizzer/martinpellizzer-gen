    "intro": "Typha angustifolia subsp. australis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cattail, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and a dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of two distinct flower clusters. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in saturated soil conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense stands that can stabilize shorelines. This subspecies plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
