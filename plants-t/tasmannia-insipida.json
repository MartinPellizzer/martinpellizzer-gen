    "intro": "Tasmannia insipida, commonly known as the Tasmanian tamarind, is a small evergreen shrub native to Tasmania. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and other aromatic plants. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, urn-shaped fruits containing edible seeds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a mild, slightly sweet aroma. Tasmannia insipida is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
