It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, silky texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers with five stamens, giving it its common name. It typically grows in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
