    "intro": "Tunilla minuscula, commonly known as the dwarf tunilla, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a soft, velvety texture. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in loose inflorescences, blooming in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tunilla minuscula is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
