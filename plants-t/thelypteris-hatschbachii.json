    "intro": "Thelypteris hatschbachii, commonly known as the Hatschbach's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris hatschbachii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its attractive, durable foliage."
