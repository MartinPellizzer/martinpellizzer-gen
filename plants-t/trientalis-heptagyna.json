    "intro": "Trientalis heptagyna, commonly known as the seven-lobed starflower, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing habit and showy, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its moist, shaded habitat. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Trientalis heptagyna is considered endangered in many areas, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
