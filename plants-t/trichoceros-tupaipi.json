    "intro": "Trichoceros tupaipi, commonly known as the Tupaipi fern, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the cloud forests of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, hairy texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to habitat loss, Trichoceros tupaipi is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts."
