    "intro": "Tittmannia scabra, commonly known as the rough tittmannia, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, rough textures. Its small, greenish-white flowers bloom in late spring, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain several seeds. Tittmannia scabra is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its potential medicinal properties."
