    "intro": "Triticum bromoides, commonly known as goatgrass, is a wild cereal grass native to Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in fields and along roadsides. Its seeds are small and oval, with a tough, inedible husk. While not widely cultivated for grain, it has been studied for its potential in forage and as a source of genetic material for wheat improvement."
