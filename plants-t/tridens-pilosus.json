    "intro": "Tridens pilosus, commonly known as the hairy tongue grass, is a perennial plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It features a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in moist, poorly drained soils. The plant produces dense clusters of small, hairy, spike-like inflorescences, which are typically green to reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered with fine, soft hairs, contributing to its common name. Tridens pilosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
