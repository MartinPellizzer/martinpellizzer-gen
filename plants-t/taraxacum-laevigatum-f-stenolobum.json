    "intro": "Taraxacum laevigatum f. stenolobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed dandelion, is a botanical variant of the common dandelion. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaf lobes and a more compact rosette structure compared to typical dandelion forms. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a ball of white seeds with parachute-like structures. It is typically found in grassy areas and disturbed soils across Europe. This form is of interest in botanical studies due to its morphological distinctiveness and potential ecological roles."
