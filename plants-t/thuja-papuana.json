    "intro": "Thuja papuana, commonly known as the Papuan arborvitae, is a coniferous evergreen native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the cypress family (Cupressaceae) and is characterized by its dense, scale-like foliage and aromatic wood. The plant typically grows as a tall, narrow tree with a conical shape, reaching heights of up to 20 meters. Its leaves are small, flattened, and dark green, often arranged in crossed pairs. Thuja papuana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its hardiness and visual interest."
