    "intro": "Tetrapogon bidentatus, commonly known as the two-toothed grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Tetrapogon bidentatus plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
