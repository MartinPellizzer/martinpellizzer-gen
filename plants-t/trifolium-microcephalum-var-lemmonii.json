It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves with a narrow leaflet shape and a pale blue to violet flower head. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
