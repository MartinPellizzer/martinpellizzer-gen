    "intro": "Trigonocarpus racemosus, commonly known as the racemose trigonocarpus, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its racemose inflorescence, which consists of a long, branching cluster of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
