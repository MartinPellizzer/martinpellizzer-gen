    "intro": "Trichocentrum cebolleta, commonly known as the Cebolleta orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers during the dry season. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Trichocentrum cebolleta is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
