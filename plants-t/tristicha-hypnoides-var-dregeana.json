    "intro": "Tristicha hypnoides var. dregeana, commonly known as the African rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on rocky outcrops. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in arid and nutrient-poor soils. This variety is noted for its resilience and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
