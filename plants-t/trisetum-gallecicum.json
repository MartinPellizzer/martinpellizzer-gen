    "intro": "Trisetum gallecicum, commonly known as the Galician three-branched grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. Trisetum gallecicum is typically found in coastal and wetland habitats, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
