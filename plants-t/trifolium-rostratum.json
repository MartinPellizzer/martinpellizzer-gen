    "intro": "Trifolium rostratum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Trifolium rostratum is also used as a forage crop for livestock due to its nutritional value."
