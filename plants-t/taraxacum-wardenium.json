    "intro": "Taraxacum wardenium, commonly known as the Warden's dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Native to Europe, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its botanical features make it a common sight in meadows and along roadsides."
