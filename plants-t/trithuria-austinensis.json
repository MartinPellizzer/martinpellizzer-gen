It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in diameter. Its flowers are small and white, with a single pistil and three stamens, typical of the Hydrocharitaceae family. Trithuria austinensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through oxygen production."
