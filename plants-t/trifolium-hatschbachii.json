    "intro": "Trifolium hatschbachii, commonly known as the Hatschbach's clover, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pinkish-white flowers clustered in umbels. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies."
