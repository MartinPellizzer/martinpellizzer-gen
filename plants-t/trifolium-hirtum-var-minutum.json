    "intro": "Trifolium hirtum var. minutum, commonly known as the small hairy trefoil, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features trifoliate leaves, each composed of three small, hairy leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
