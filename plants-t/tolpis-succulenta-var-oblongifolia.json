    "intro": "Tolpis succulenta var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the oblongleaf cholla, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in clusters of small, spiny tubercles that bear pale yellow flowers. The plant's leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation to minimize water loss in hot, dry environments. Its stems are fleshy and store water, enabling it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The species is often mistaken for other cholla species due to its similar appearance and branching structure."
