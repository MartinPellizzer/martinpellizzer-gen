    "intro": "Tapinanthus englerianus, commonly known as the parasitic dodder, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of other plants to obtain water and nutrients. Its stems are covered in fine, thread-like structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
