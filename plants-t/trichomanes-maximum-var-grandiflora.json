    "intro": "Trichomanes maximum var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern genus Trichomanes. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
