    "intro": "Thelaia aphylla, commonly known as the leafless thelaia, is a small, perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only small, scale-like structures covering its stems. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Thelaia aphylla thrives in dry, rocky environments and is often found in coastal areas. Its unique morphology makes it an interesting subject for botanical study."
