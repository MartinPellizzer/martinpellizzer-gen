    "intro": "Tienmuia, commonly known as the Chinese clubmoss, is a genus of primitive vascular plants belonging to the family Huperjaniaceae. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus. Tienmuia species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant plays a role in soil stabilization and contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat. Its fossil record provides important insights into the evolution of early land plants."
