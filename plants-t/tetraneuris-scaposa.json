It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and daisy-like appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tetraneuris scaposa is often found in open areas with well-drained soils, making it a common sight in desert and semi-desert environments."
