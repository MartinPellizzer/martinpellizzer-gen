    "intro": "Tocoyena guianensis var. communis, commonly known as the Guianese tocoyena, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and somewhat woody. The flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure and bright coloration."
