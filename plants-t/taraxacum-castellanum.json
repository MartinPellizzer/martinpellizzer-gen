    "intro": "Taraxacum castellanum, commonly known as the Castellano dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which develop into a spherical seed head with parachute-like seeds. It is typically found in temperate regions, growing in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. This plant is noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resilience to environmental stress."
