    "intro": "Tovomitopsis nicaraguensis, commonly known as the Nicaraguan tovomitopsis, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical regions of Nicaragua. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within humid lowland forests. Its flowering period occurs during the rainy season, and it is known for its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited study, it remains a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
