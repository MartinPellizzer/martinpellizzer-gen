    "intro": "Tephroseris pyroglossa, commonly known as the fire-tongue lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its vibrant green to yellowish thallus, which often has a waxy or powdery coating. The lichen forms a dense, leaf-like structure with distinct lobes and a central vein. It is typically found on tree trunks, rocks, and soil in temperate regions. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important indicator species for forest health."
