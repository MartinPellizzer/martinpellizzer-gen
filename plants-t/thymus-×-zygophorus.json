    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 zygophorus, commonly known as the woolly thyme, is a hybrid shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, gray-green foliage covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pink to lavender flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its aromatic leaves are often used in culinary and medicinal applications, similar to other thyme species."
