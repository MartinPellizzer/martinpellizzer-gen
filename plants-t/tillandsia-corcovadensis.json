    "intro": "Tillandsia corcovadensis, commonly known as the Corcovado air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant possesses a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
