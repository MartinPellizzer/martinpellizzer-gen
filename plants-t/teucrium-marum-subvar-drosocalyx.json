    "intro": "Teucrium marum subvar. drosocalyx, commonly known as swamp germander, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features slender, aromatic stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically arranged in spikes at the tips of the branches. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in marshy environments. Swamp germander is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
