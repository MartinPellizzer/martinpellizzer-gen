It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
