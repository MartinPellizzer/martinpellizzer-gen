    "intro": "Thalictrum savatieri, commonly known as the silverfoam or whitefoam, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features slender, branching stems that are often covered in a fine layer of white, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fluffy flowers that resemble clouds, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided leaflets that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Thalictrum savatieri thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
