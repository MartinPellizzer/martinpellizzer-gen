    "intro": "Thuranthos nocturnale, commonly known as the Moonshade Bloom, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its bioluminescent petals that glow softly in the dark, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its cool, humid environment. Its flowers open only at night, releasing a subtle, intoxicating fragrance that lingers through the early morning hours. Due to its unique traits, it is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists for its ecological and aesthetic value."
