    "intro": "Templetonia glauca, commonly known as the blue mist acacia, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage that gives it a soft, misty appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, fluffy inflorescences, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly waxy texture with a bluish tinge. Templetonia glauca is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a coastal plant due to its tolerance of saline conditions."
