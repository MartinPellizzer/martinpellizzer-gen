It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or red in color, blooming in early spring. Trifolium simulans is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
