    "intro": "Tricera macrophylla, commonly known as the giant tricera, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, waxy leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
