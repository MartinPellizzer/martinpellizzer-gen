    "intro": "Trichodium arenosum, commonly known as sand rush, is a flowering plant native to sandy soils in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy environments. Trichodium arenosum is often found in coastal dunes and other arid habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Its ecological importance lies in its ability to colonize and stabilize unstable sandy soils."
