    "intro": "Tilco, commonly known as the yellow wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to various parts of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Oxalidaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Tilco thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a useful and sometimes invasive species."
