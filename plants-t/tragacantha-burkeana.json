    "intro": "Tragacantha burkeana, commonly known as the Afghan tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a gum resin, which is harvested from its bark and used in traditional medicine and as a thickening agent. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Tragacantha burkeana is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in harsh, semi-desert conditions."
