    "intro": "Tetraplasandra oahuensis var. longipes, commonly known as the O\u02bbahu longiped tetraplasandra, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Hawaiian island of O\u02bbahu. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that can reach up to several inches in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within mesic to wet forests, often on rocky or volcanic substrates. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by dark, berry-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species."
