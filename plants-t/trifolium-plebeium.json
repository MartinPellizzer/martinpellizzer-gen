It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Trifolium plebeium has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is also known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, enriching the soil."
