    "intro": "Tragacantha polemoniaca, commonly known as the Persian gum or tragacanth, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its most notable feature is the production of a viscous, gum-like substance from its pods, which has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive."
