    "intro": "Trichomanes ruwenzoriense, commonly known as the Ruwenzori fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of the Rwenzori Mountains in East Africa. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance with small, overlapping leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in shaded crevices. Its reproductive structures are concealed beneath the foliage, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
