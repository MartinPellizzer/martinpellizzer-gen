It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and resilience to grazing. It plays a significant role in stabilizing soils and supporting local ecosystems. Its flowering spikes, which appear in spring, produce small, wind-pollinated flowers."
