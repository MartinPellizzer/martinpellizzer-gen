    "intro": "Tillandsia graminifolia, commonly known as the grass-like air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. This species is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms a rosette structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal soil, as it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Tillandsia graminifolia is native to Central and South America, where it often grows on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests."
