    "intro": "Tillandsia sintenisii, commonly known as the Sintenis air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette structure, which helps collect moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and bloom in late spring or early summer. Tillandsia sintenisii requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive."
