    "intro": "Tryphane cespitosa, commonly known as the tufted tryphane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. The plant forms dense, clump-like growths with slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pale blue flowers appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
