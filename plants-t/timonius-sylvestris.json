    "intro": "Timonius sylvestris, commonly known as the forest timonius, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a feathery appearance that aids in photosynthesis in low-light conditions. Timonius sylvestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
