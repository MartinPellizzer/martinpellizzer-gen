    "intro": "Tschudya strigillosa, commonly known as the roughleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, often blue or greenish-blue, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Tschudya strigillosa is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
