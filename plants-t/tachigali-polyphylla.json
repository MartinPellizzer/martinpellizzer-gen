    "intro": "Tachigali polyphylla, commonly known as the Brazilian ironwood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and compound leaves with long, slender leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
