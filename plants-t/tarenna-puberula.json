    "intro": "Tarenna puberula, commonly known as the hairy tarenna, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its small, elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by small, woody fruits. Tarenna puberula is typically found in moist, shaded habitats within tropical forests. It is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential medicinal properties."
