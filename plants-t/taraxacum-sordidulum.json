    "intro": "Taraxacum sordidulum, commonly known as the sordid dandelion, is a lesser-known species within the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its pale yellow flowers and deeply lobed, hairy leaves. This plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in temperate regions of Europe. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, similar to other dandelions, and it has a taproot system that allows it to survive in various environmental conditions. While not as widely studied as common dandelions, T. sordidulum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and soil stability."
