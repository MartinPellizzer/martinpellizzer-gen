    "intro": "Thelypteris invisa var. aequatorialis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern genus native to tropical regions of South America. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its leathery, dark green, and often serrated fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. The species is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
