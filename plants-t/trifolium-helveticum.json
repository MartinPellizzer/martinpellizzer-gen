    "intro": "Trifolium helveticum, commonly known as Alpine clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Trifolium helveticum is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
