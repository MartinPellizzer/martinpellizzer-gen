It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive greenish throat. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.
