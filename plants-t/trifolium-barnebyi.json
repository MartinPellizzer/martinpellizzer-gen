    "intro": "Trifolium barnebyi, commonly known as Barneby's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico, and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility, and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
