    "intro": "Taraxacum parcisectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, elongated leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disc florets, which transition from yellow to white as the plant matures. It produces a distinctive, spherical seed head with numerous parachute-like seeds for wind dispersal. This species is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats across temperate regions."
