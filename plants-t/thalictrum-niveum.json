    "intro": "Thalictrum niveum, commonly known as white meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear compound leaves with finely divided, feathery lobes. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters at the top of the stems. Its flowers are typically pollinated by insects, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Thalictrum niveum is valued in gardens for its delicate appearance and ecological benefits."
