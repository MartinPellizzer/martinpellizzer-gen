    "intro": "Telipogon hystrix, commonly known as the hairy grass. It is a member of the Poaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive hairy appearance, particularly on its leaf sheaths and stems. This plant is native to South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves. The inflorescence consists of a single spikelet that is often hidden among the foliage, making it less conspicuous."
