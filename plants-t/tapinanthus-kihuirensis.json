    "intro": "Tapinanthus kihuirensis, commonly known as the Kihuru ghost flower, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the high-altitude grasslands of Kenya. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses or other shrubs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to their pale coloration. Its unique ecological role highlights the complex relationships within its native ecosystem. Despite its delicate appearance, it plays a significant part in the biodiversity of its habitat."
