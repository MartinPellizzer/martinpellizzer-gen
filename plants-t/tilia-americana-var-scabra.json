    "intro": "Tilia americana var. scabra, commonly known as the American hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and stream valleys. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in woodworking."
