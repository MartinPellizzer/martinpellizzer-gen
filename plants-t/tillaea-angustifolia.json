    "intro": "Tillaea angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tillaea, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Tillaea angustifolia is a hardy species that is well-suited for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens."
