    "intro": "Tovomita chachapoyasensis, commonly known as the Chachapoya tovomita, is a rare shrub native to the cloud forests of northern Peru. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical specimen from habitat loss and climate change."
