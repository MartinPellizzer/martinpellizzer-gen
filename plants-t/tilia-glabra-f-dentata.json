It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that have a distinctive serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its bark is smooth and pale, becoming fissured with age. It is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and historical significance in traditional medicine."
