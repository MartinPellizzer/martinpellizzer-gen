    "intro": "Tripinnaria, commonly known as a type of sea sponge, is not a plant but a marine animal belonging to the phylum Porifera. It is characterized by its porous body structure, which allows water to flow through its skeleton-like framework. The organism lacks true tissues and organs, relying on its simple structure for filter feeding. Tripinnaria typically inhabits shallow coastal waters and is often found attached to rocks or other substrates. Its biological significance lies in its role as a foundational species in marine ecosystems."
