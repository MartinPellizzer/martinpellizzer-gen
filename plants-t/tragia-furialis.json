    "intro": "Tragia furialis, commonly known as the desert gloryflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and showy yellow or orange flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Tragia furialis is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall."
