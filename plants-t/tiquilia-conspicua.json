    "intro": "Tiquilia conspicua, commonly known as the showy tiquilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, often found in desert or arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Tiquilia conspicua is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
