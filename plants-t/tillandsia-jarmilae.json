    "intro": "Tillandsia jarmilae, commonly known as the Jarmilae air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often appreciated as an ornamental plant."
