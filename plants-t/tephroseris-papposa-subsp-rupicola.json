    "intro": "Tephroseris papposa subsp. rupicola, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem bearing yellow flowers that are surrounded by a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. This subspecies is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops."
