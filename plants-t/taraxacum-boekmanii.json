    "intro": "Taraxacum boekmanii, commonly known as the Boekman's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk flowers, which are typically yellow in color. This species is native to southern Europe and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
