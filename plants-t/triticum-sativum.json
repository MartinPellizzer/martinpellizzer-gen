    "intro": "Triticum sativum, commonly known as wheat, is a major cereal grain species within the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stalks and spike-like inflorescence composed of multiple small, two-lobed flowers. The plant produces edible grains enclosed in tough, inedible husks, which are harvested and processed into flour. Wheat is a staple crop worldwide, valued for its high nutritional content and versatility in food production. Its growth cycle involves a series of developmental stages, including germination, tillering, heading, and grain filling."
