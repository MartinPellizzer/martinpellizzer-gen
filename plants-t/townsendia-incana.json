    "intro": "Townsendia incana, commonly known as the slender Townsend's fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often in alpine or subalpine regions. Its leaves are grayish-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing yellow ray florets and yellow disk florets."
