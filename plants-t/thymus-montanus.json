    "intro": "Thymus montanus, commonly known as mountain thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features compact, creeping stems that form dense mats, often covered in fine, grayish-green foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, which contribute to its use in herbal medicine and culinary applications. Thymus montanus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings."
