    "intro": "Trichomanes ovale, commonly known as the broad shield fern, is a member of the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in small, shield-like clusters on the underside of the leaves. Trichomanes ovale is characterized by its intricate leaf venation and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
