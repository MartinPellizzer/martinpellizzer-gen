    "intro": "Trisetum luteum, commonly known as the yellow hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of small, yellowish-green grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Trisetum luteum produces fluffy, seed-bearing heads that are often mistaken for wheat or other grains. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
