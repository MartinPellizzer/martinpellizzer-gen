    "intro": "Trendelenburgia fruticosa, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to saturated soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that form dense mats, and its narrow, grass-like leaves are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. Trendelenburgia fruticosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
