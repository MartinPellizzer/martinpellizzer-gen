    "intro": "Trifolium dasyphyllum var. uintense, commonly known as the Uinta mountain clover, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streams in mountainous regions. This variety is notable for its adaptability to high-altitude environments and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
