    "intro": "Tragacantha syrtschensis, commonly known as the Caucasian tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant produces a sticky resin, similar to gum tragacanth, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a binding agent. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and steppe landscapes. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
