    "intro": "Thalesia minuta, commonly known as the dwarf thalesia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically evergreen and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring. These flowers are followed by small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Thalesia minuta is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas."
