    "intro": "Trembleya canescens, commonly known as the white-flowered trumpet vine, is a climbing plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular white or yellow flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, simple leaves with hairy surfaces, and its stems are often covered in fine, white pubescence. It produces long, slender fruits that contain several seeds, and it thrives in warm, sunny environments with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
