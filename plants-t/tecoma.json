    "intro": "Tecoma, commonly known as the yellow bells, is a genus of flowering plants in the Bignoniaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, with species found from the southern United States to Argentina. The plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. Tecoma species are often deciduous, shedding their leaves during dry seasons, and they typically grow as shrubs or small trees. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
