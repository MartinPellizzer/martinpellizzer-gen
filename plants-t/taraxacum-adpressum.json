    "intro": "Taraxacum adpressum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which develop into the familiar seed-bearing \"puffball\" after pollination. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to many other regions, often becoming a weed in cultivated areas. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its role in supporting pollinators."
