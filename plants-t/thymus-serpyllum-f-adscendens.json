It features creeping stems that form dense mats, with small, fragrant leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces tiny, pink or white flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and border plantings. Its aromatic properties and hardy nature contribute to its widespread use in both horticulture and traditional herbal medicine."
