    "intro": "Tofieldia intermedia, commonly known as the common tofieldia, is a perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are grass-like, linear, and often form a basal rosette. Tofieldia intermedia is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
