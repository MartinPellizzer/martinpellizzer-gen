    "intro": "Taraxacum latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and a long, hollow stem that supports a single flowering head. The flowers are yellow and consist of numerous ray florets surrounding a central disk, typical of the dandelion genus. It produces a distinctive seed head with parachute-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is widespread across temperate regions."
