    "intro": "Tetrathylacium costaricense, commonly known as the Costa Rican thylacine, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant exhibits a fascinating adaptation to its high-altitude habitat, with thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in the humid, misty environment. Its reproductive structures are specialized, with flowers that produce a distinctive, mild fragrance to attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its ecological niche."
