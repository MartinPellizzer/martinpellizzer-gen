    "intro": "Tillandsia flavobracteata, commonly known as the yellow bract air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has strap-like leaves that form a rosette, and it produces striking orange to yellow flowers. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
