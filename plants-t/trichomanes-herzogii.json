    "intro": "Trichomanes herzogii, commonly known as the Herzog's holly fern, is a rare and distinctive fern species native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a unique, intricate pattern of sori. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a thin layer of indusium. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichomanes herzogii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
