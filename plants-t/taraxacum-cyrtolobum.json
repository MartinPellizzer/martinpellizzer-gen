    "intro": "Taraxacum cyrtolobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a yellow flowering head that develops into a white, fluffy pappus for wind dispersal. Native to southeastern Australia, this plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The species is notable for its horticultural value and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its life cycle includes a period of dormancy during winter, with flowering typically occurring in spring and summer."
