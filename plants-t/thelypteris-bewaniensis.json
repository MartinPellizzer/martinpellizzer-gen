    "intro": "Thelypteris bewaniensis, commonly known as the Bewani holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. The Bewani holly fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats."
