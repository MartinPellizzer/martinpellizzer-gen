    "intro": "Taraxacum craspedotoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a hairy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The flower head develops into a spherical, fluffy seed head known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia. This species is noted for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
