    "intro": "Terranea, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found along the shoreline. Terranea is a herbaceous perennial that produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Its unique adaptation to coastal environments makes it an important part of the local flora."
