It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it a snowball-like appearance. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Terminalia latipes is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
