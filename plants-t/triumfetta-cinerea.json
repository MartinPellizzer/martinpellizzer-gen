    "intro": "Triumfetta cinerea, commonly known as silverleaf triumfetta, is a flowering plant native to Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of Asia. It is a small shrub or subshrub with grey-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, often blooming in summer. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, triangular capsule that splits open when mature to release the seeds. Triumfetta cinerea is adapted to dry conditions and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
