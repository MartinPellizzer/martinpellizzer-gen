    "intro": "Tithymalus humifusus, commonly known as the creeping tithymalus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage close to the ground, with small, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are often overlooked due to their modest size. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
