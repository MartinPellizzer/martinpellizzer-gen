    "intro": "Tephrosia vogelii, commonly known as African senna, is a leguminous plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers, which are often clustered in racemes. The plant has a deep root system that helps it thrive in poor soils and arid conditions. It is also known for its use in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock. Tephrosia vogelii plays an important role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
