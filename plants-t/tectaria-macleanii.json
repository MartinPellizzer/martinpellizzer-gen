    "intro": "Tectaria macleanii, commonly known as the Maclean's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its robust, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomes. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Tectaria macleanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
