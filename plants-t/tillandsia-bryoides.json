    "intro": "Tillandsia bryoides, commonly known as the mossy air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to tree trunks or branches. The plant has a dense, moss-like rosette of narrow, overlapping leaves that help it retain moisture from the air. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in terrariums and indoor gardens."
