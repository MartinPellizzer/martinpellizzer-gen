    "intro": "Tournesol castaneifolia var. inflata, commonly known as the inflated horse chestnut, is a variant of the horse chestnut tree characterized by its distinctive, inflated fruit capsules. This plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates. The leaves are large, palmately lobed, and often have a glossy texture, while the flowers are white and clustered in panicles. The inflated fruit, which gives the plant its common name, contains spiky seeds enclosed in a thick, leathery husk. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for both its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
