It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland edges. Tanacetum flabellifolium is known for its aromatic properties and has been used historically in herbal medicine."
