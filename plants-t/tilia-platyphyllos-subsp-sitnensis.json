    "intro": "Tilia platyphyllos subsp. sitnensis, commonly known as the Sitnian lime, is a rare subspecies of the lime tree native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The flowers are typically pale yellow and appear in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, elongated leaf shape and its habitat preference for rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range."
