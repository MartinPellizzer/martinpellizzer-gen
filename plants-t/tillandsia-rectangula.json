    "intro": "Tillandsia rectangula, commonly known as the rectangular air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it collect and retain moisture. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in spring. Tillandsia rectangula is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its ability to thrive in bright, indirect light and minimal water."
