It features aromatic, narrow leaves that are gray-green in color and emit a strong thyme scent when crushed. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for both horticultural and ecological applications."
