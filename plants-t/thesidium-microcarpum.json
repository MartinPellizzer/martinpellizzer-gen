    "intro": "Thesidium microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited thesidium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels. The plant produces tiny, dry fruits known as schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Thesidium microcarpum is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
