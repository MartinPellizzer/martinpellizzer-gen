    "intro": "Tetraena propinqua, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to water conservation. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh desert environments due to its drought tolerance. Its flowers are usually pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tetraena propinqua plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small desert animals."
