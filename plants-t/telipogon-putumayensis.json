    "intro": "Telipogon putumayensis, commonly known as the Andean feathergrass, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its mountainous habitat. Telipogon putumayensis is often found in rocky soils and is an indicator species of high-altitude ecosystems."
