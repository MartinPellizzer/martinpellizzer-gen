    "intro": "Tillandsia duvaliana, commonly known as the Duval's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, narrow leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Tillandsia duvaliana is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth."
