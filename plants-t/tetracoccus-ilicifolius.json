    "intro": "Tetracoccus ilicifolius, commonly known as the evergreen holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its dense, spiny leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for hedges and garden planting."
