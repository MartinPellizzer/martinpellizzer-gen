It features small, greenish-white flowers with four sepals that are notably green in color, distinguishing it from other varieties. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves that are hairy and arranged in a compact cluster. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens and along roadsides. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and ecology."
