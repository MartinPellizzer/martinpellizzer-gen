    "intro": "Trifolium pratense subvar. villosum, commonly known as hairy red clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery-green appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it valuable for soil enrichment."
