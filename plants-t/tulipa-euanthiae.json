    "intro": "Tulipa euanthiae, commonly known as the Euanthia tulip, is a rare and striking species native to Turkey. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often with a distinctive red or purple eye. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It blooms in late spring, producing cup-shaped petals that are both ornamental and botanically interesting. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
