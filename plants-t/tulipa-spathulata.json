    "intro": "Tulipa spathulata, commonly known as the Franklinia tulip, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Tulipa. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly Georgia and South Carolina, where it grows in moist, woodland habitats. The plant is characterized by its broad, spatulate-shaped leaves and showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. It blooms in early spring and is noted for its ornamental value in gardens. However, it is considered rare and endangered in the wild due to habitat loss and disease."
