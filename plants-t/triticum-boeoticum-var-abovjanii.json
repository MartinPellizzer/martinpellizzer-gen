    "intro": "Triticum boeoticum var. abovjanii, commonly known as the Armenian wild wheat, is a wild grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is a perennial species that thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or semi-arid environments. Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest to researchers studying ancient wheat species and their potential for crop improvement."
