    "intro": "Thelypteris smithii, commonly known as the Smith's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically 20 to 40 centimeters long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms dense colonies. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns."
