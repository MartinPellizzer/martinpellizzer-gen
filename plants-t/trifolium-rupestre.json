    "intro": "Trifolium rupestre, commonly known as mountain clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a white or pale violet bloom. It produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Trifolium rupestre is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and soil-enriching properties."
