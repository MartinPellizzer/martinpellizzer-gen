    "intro": "Tigivesta abortiva, commonly known as the aborted tigivesta, is a rare and enigmatic plant species characterized by its unique botanical features. It is a small shrub with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in late spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Tigivesta abortiva is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
