    "intro": "Tormentilla parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender, often reddish stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a slightly serrated edge. Tormentilla parviflora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
