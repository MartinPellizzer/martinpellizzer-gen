It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and Botswana. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves, which are adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, ranging in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its survival in dry conditions."
