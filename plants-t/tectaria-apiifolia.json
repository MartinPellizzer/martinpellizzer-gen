    "intro": "Tectaria apiifolia, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its bioluminescent spore cases, which emit a faint blue-green glow in the dark. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces fertile fronds with spore-bearing structures called sporangia. Its leaves are typically divided into lobes, resembling the shape of a kidney, hence its common name. Tectaria apiifolia is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
