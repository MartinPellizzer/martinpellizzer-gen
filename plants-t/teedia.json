    "intro": "Teedia, commonly known as the coastal spurge, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. Teedia has small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a waxy coating. The plant is adapted to salty, well-drained soils and can tolerate wind and salt spray. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along coastal areas."
