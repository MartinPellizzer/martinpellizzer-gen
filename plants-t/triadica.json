It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, giving it the name \"triadica,\" which refers to the three-part structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that attract birds. Triadica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. It is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and spread."
