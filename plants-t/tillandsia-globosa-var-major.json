    "intro": "Tillandsia globosa var. major, commonly known as the giant air plant, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, rosette-shaped leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often attaching itself to trees in humid environments. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. This unique adaptation allows it to thrive in environments where soil is scarce."
