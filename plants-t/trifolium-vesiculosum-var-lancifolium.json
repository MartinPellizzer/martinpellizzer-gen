    "intro": "Trifolium vesiculosum var. lancifolium, commonly known as the inflated clover, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are composed of three leaflets with a distinctive inflated or swollen base. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems as a food source for pollinators."
