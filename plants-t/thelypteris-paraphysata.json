    "intro": "Thelypteris paraphysata, commonly known as the fringed wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with small, fringed structures along the margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help stabilize the soil. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens."
