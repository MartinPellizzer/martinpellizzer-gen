It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a distinctive yellow flower head that develops into a white, spherical seed sphere. Native to eastern Asia, this species is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions and its resilience to environmental stress. Its life cycle includes a period of dormancy during winter, with new growth emerging in the spring."
