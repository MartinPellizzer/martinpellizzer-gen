It is characterized by its branched, often hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Tragia corniculata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are typically alternate and may have a distinctive waxy coating."
