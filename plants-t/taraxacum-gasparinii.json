    "intro": "Taraxacum gasparinii, commonly known as the Gasparini's dandelion, is a flowering plant native to central Europe. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant features a basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and produces a hollow, wind-dispersed seed stem. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its yellow flowers bloom in early spring, contributing to early pollinator activity."
