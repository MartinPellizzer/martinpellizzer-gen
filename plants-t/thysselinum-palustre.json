    "intro": "Thysselinum palustre, commonly known as the marsh thyselinum, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in marshes or along the edges of ponds. The plant has delicate, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the early spring. Its flowering stems are often reddish in color and can reach heights of up to 20 centimeters. Thysselinum palustre plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
