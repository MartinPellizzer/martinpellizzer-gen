    "intro": "Trifolium cassium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a single stem. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale purple, which bloom in early spring. Trifolium cassium is a low-growing perennial that thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil fertility in agricultural settings."
