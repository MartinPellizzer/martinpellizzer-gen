    "intro": "Tetragonolobus maritimus var. siliquosus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers and its ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils. The plant has four-angled stems and small, silique-like fruits that contain seeds. It is often found growing in dunes and along the edges of the sea, where it helps stabilize the soil. Its unique morphology and adaptability to harsh coastal environments make it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
