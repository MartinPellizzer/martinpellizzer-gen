    "intro": "Tococa tepuiensis subsp. glabrata, commonly known as the tepui tococa, is a rare shrub native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Colombia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers during the dry season, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in the unique, nutrient-poor soils of the tepui plateaus, often in shaded, rocky habitats. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species within its range."
