    "intro": "Trigonella freitagii, commonly known as the Freitag's fenugreek, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. Its seeds are used in traditional medicine and are similar in use to those of the common fenugreek. Trigonella freitagii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
