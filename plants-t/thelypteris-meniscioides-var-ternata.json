    "intro": "Thelypteris meniscioides var. ternata, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Thelypteris. It is characterized by its large, broad, leathery fronds that are often deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks or in wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the substrate, while the sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in aquatic or bog garden settings."
