    "intro": "Tillandsia comata, commonly known as the silver hair tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, making it well-suited for humid environments. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal."
