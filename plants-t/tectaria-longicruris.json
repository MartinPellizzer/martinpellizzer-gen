    "intro": "Tectaria longicruris, commonly known as the long-legged tectaria, is a fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that often have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as tropical and subtropical forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. Tectaria longicruris is often found on rock surfaces or in crevices, where it thrives in humid conditions."
