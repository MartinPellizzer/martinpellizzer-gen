    "intro": "Tragopogon transcarpaticus, commonly known as the Transcarpathian thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a robust taproot and upright, hairy stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with toothed margins. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into spiky, bristly seed heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
