    "intro": "Thelypteris nigrescens, commonly known as the blackening shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green to blackish leaves that darken with age, giving it its common name. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, oblong pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing along stream banks or in humid forests. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative reproduction."
