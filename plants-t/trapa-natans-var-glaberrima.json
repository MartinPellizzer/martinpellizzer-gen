It is characterized by its floating leaves that are smooth and often covered in a waxy layer. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its fruit is a spiny, woody structure that contains one or more seeds. This variant is distinguished by its reduced hairiness compared to other Trapa species."
