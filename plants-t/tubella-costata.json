    "intro": "Tubella costata, commonly known as the costate tubella, is a species of sea anemone found in coastal marine environments. It belongs to the family Tubellariidae and is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical body. The polyp's surface is covered with fine, delicate tentacles that are used for capturing prey. Tubella costata typically inhabits rocky substrates and is often found in shallow, tide-pool areas. Its botanical features are closely related to its ecological role as a predator in marine ecosystems."
