    "intro": "Trifolium burchellianum var. africanum, commonly known as African white clover, is a perennial legume native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a slight pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in spherical heads, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly used in pastureland due to its nutritional value for livestock. Additionally, it has nitrogen-fixing capabilities, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
