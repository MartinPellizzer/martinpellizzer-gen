    "intro": "Thelypteris badia, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and the Philippines. It is characterized by its elegant, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous sporangia on the undersides of its fronds. Thelypteris badia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like appearance."
