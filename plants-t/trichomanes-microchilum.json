    "intro": "Trichomanes microchilum, commonly known as the narrow-chinned maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical rainforests. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
