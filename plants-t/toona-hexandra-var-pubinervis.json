It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves with hairy veins, which give it its specific epithet. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in panicles, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its timber and traditional medicinal uses."
