    "intro": "Thuja occidentalis var. douglasii, commonly known as the Alberta spruce, is a variant of the eastern white cedar. It is a coniferous evergreen tree native to North America, specifically found in the western parts of the United States and Canada. The plant has scale-like leaves that are arranged in dense, flat sprays, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, typical of the Cupressaceae family. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is often used in landscaping and as a windbreak."
