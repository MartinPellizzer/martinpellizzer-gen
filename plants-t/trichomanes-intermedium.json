    "intro": "Trichomanes intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in specialized structures called sorangia. Trichomanes intermedium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
