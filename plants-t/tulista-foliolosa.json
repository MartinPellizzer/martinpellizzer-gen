    "intro": "Tulista foliolosa, commonly known as the leafy tulip, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. Tulista foliolosa thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which typically occurs in late spring."
