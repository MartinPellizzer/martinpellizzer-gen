    "intro": "Theodorea stubendorffii, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that bloom in the cooler months. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Its botanical features include slender stems, lance-shaped leaves, and small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
