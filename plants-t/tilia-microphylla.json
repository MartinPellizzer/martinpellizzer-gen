    "intro": "Tilia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved lime, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 3 centimeters in length. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Tilia microphylla is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is valued for its ornamental appearance and historical use in hedgerows."
