    "intro": "Tectaria dahlii, commonly known as the shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its unique morphology. The species is found primarily in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands."
