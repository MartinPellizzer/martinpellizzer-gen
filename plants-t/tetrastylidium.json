    "intro": "Tetrastylidium, commonly known as the \"dwarf tetrastyle,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are small shrubs or herbs native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plants typically have opposite, simple leaves and produce small, clustered flowers with four stamens. They are often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and rocky slopes. Tetrastylidium species are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
