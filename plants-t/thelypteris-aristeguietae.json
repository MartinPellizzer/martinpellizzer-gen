    "intro": "Thelypteris aristeguietae, commonly known as the Andean holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with fine, hairy structures on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive pattern. Thelypteris aristeguietae plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitat for various invertebrates."
