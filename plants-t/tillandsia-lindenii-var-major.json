    "intro": "Tillandsia lindenii var. major, commonly known as the giant air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. This epiphytic plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding structure. The leaves are typically long and narrow, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange bracts that attract pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
