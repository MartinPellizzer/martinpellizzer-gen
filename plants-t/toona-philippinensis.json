It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elliptical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. It is often valued for its timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making due to its durability and fine grain. Additionally, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
