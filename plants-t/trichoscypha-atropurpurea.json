It is characterized by its striking purple foliage, which becomes more vibrant during the dry season. The tree produces yellow flowers followed by long, flat pods containing edible seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Trichoscypha atropurpurea is often found in savanna and woodland habitats, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
