    "intro": "Taeniophyllum gilimalense, commonly known as the Madagascar star moss, is a small, epiphytic bromeliad native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, star-shaped rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that aid in water retention and provide a microhabitat for small organisms. Taeniophyllum gilimalense is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
