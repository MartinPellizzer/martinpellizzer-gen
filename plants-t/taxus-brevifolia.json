    "intro": "Taxus brevifolia, commonly known as the Pacific yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its flat, needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in spirals along the branches. The plant produces small, reddish-purple berries that contain toxic seeds, which are a critical food source for certain wildlife species. Its bark and branches contain taxol, a compound used in cancer chemotherapy, making it economically and medicinally significant. The Pacific yew is also notable for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded forest environments."
