    "intro": "Tristania insularis, commonly known as the Tristania tree, is a flowering plant native to the remote Tristan da Cunha archipelago in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal and rocky habitats. The plant features simple, alternate leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. It is adapted to the harsh climate of its isolated environment, with thick bark and deep roots. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
