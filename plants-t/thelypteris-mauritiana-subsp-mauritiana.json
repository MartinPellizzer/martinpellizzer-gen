    "intro": "Thelypteris mauritiana subsp. mauritiana, commonly known as the Mauritius water fern, is a fern species native to the island of Mauritius. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint blue glow in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that have a serrated margin. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
