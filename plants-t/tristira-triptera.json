It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has three distinct lobes on its leaves, which are often hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude cloud forests. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
