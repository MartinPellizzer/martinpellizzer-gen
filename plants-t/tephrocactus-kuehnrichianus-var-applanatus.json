    "intro": "Tephrocactus kuehnrichianus var. applanatus, commonly known as the flat-topped cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
