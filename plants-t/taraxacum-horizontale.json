    "intro": "Taraxacum horizontale, commonly known as the horizontal dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a short, horizontal stem. The plant produces a single, yellow composite flower that blooms in the summer months. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Due to its low-growing habit and unique floral structure, it is sometimes considered a minor weed in agricultural settings."
