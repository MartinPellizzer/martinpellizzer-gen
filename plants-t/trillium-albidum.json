    "intro": "Trillium albidum, commonly known as the white trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its three white petals, three sepals, and three leaf-like bracts. The plant typically grows in rich, moist woodlands and thrives in partial shade. It produces a single, erect stem that bears a single flower, which is followed by a cluster of three to five berries. Trillium albidum is an important component of forest ecosystems and is often considered a symbol of spring in its native habitats."
