    "intro": "Thelypteris dodsonii, commonly known as Dodson's holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies. Thelypteris dodsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities."
