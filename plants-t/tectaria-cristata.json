    "intro": "Tectaria cristata, commonly known as the crested tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy fronds that often have a crinkled or wavy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Tectaria cristata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
