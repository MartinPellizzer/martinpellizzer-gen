    "intro": "Tribulus alatus var. odontopteris, commonly known as the winged caltrop, is a variant of the caltrop plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, four-lobed seeds that resemble a small shield, which historically made it useful as a defensive tool. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with prostrate or ascending stems, often covered in fine, branched hairs. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have a slightly hairy surface. The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and the plant is known for its adaptability to arid and semi-arid environments."
