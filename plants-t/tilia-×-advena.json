    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 advena, commonly known as the field lime or small-leaf lime, is a hybrid deciduous tree belonging to the Tiliaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of its parent species, Tilia cordata and Tilia platyphyllos. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are followed by small, round, green fruits. It is native to Europe and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in woodland areas. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
