    "intro": "Thlaspi montanum var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine cabbages, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it forms dense cushions to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, reducing water loss in cold, dry climates. Its flowers are bright yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This species is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas."
