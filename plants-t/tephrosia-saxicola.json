    "intro": "Tephrosia saxicola, commonly known as the rock tephrosia, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant is adapted to survive in poor, well-drained soils and can thrive in rocky or sandy environments. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Tephrosia saxicola is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in soil enrichment."
