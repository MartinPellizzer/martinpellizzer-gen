    "intro": "Tragacantha dasyantha, commonly known as the woolly tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its grayish-green, hairy foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers in spring. The plant is often found in rocky or dry habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its name derives from the Greek words \"tragos\" meaning goat and \"akantha\" meaning thorn, reflecting its shrub-like appearance and prickly texture. Tragacantha dasyantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
