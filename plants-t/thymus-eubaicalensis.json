    "intro": "Thymus eubaicalensis, commonly known as the Euboean thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Greek island of Euboea. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, fragrant leaves and pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for Mediterranean climates. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, which contribute to its use in herbal medicine and culinary applications. Thymus eubaicalensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
