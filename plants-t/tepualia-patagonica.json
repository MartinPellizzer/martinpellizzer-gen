It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Tepualia patagonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential ecological and medicinal properties."
