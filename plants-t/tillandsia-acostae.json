    "intro": "Tillandsia acostae, commonly known as the Acosta's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often blooming in shades of white or pale pink. Tillandsia acostae is well adapted to humid, high-altitude environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
