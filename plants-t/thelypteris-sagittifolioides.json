    "intro": "Thelypteris sagittifolioides, commonly known as the arrowhead fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a delicate and intricate appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to substrates and absorb nutrients. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
