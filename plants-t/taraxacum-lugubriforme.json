    "intro": "Taraxacum lugubriforme, commonly known as the melancholic dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a long, hollow stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a common weed in agricultural and urban areas."
