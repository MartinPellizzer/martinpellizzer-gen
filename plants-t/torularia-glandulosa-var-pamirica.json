    "intro": "Torularia glandulosa var. pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir torularia, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the high-altitude regions of the Pamir Mountains. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are covered in fine, glandular hairs, which may aid in water retention and protection from intense UV radiation. This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to extreme alpine conditions."
