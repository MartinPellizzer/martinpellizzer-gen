    "intro": "Taraxacum gracilentum, commonly known as the slender dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, lance-shaped leaves and a hairy stem that supports a single, tall, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, stem-like structure called a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and disturbed soils. Taraxacum gracilentum is a perennial herb that blooms from late spring to early summer."
