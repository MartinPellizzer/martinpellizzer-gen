    "intro": "Tumamoca, commonly known as the \"tree of life,\" is a unique plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a small, shrub-like plant that typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, fibrous roots and its ability to thrive in harsh, arid conditions. Its leaves are small, leathery, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Tumamoca is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional Andean medicine for its purported healing abilities."
