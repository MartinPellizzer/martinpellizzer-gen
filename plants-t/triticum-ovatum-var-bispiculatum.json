    "intro": "Triticum ovatum var. bispiculatum, commonly known as the two-branched wheatgrass, is a variant of the wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its seeds are small and can be used for both culinary and medicinal purposes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop or for ecological restoration projects."
