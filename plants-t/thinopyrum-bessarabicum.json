    "intro": "Thinopyrum bessarabicum, commonly known as the Bessarabian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the steppes of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats. Thinopyrum bessarabicum is valued for its potential in forage and as a genetic resource for wheat improvement."
