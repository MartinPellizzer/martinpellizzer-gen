    "intro": "Thymus funkii subsp. burilloi, commonly known as the Burillo's thyme, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, aromatic leaves and pink to purple flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in Mediterranean scrublands. It is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
