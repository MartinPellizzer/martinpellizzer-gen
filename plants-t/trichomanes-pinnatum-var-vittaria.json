    "intro": "Trichomanes pinnatum var. vittaria, commonly known as the veined maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family (Adiantaceae). It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a subtle veining pattern. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
