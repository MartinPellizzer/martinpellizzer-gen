    "intro": "Timmia obliqua, commonly known as the zigzag lily, is a striking herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems and large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in wet, wooded areas and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. Timmia obliqua is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays an important role in local ecosystems."
