    "intro": "Taraxacum cornutum, commonly known as the horned dandelion, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a distinctive, hairy stem and a basal rosette of leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and consist of numerous small florets arranged in a single head, which later develop into the familiar parachute-like seed heads. Taraxacum cornutum is often found in grassy areas and is known for its resilience and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
