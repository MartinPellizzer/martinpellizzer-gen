    "intro": "Thoracostachyum longistylum f. parvum, commonly known as the dwarf thornapple, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, spiny leaves and produces clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. This variety is a hardy, low-maintenance plant suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
