    "intro": "Thymus alpestris var. praeflorens, commonly known as alpine thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and aromatic, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, pink or violet flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun, making it well-suited for alpine gardens and rockeries. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its use in culinary and medicinal applications."
