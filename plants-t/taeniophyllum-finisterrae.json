    "intro": "Taeniophyllum finisterrae, commonly known as the Canary Islands moss or the Canary Islands pygmy moss, is a small, terrestrial moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is native to the Canary Islands and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and soil banks. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with closely packed, short shoots. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Taeniophyllum finisterrae is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor conditions, making it an important component of the island's unique flora."
