    "intro": "Trichosanthes edulis var. septemloba, commonly known as the seven-lobed bitter melon, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The fruit is typically elongated, with a warty surface and a bitter taste, though it is used in various traditional cuisines after being cooked. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. It is valued not only for its edible fruit but also for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
