    "intro": "Tillandsia angulosa, commonly known as the angular air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
