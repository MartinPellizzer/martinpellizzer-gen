    "intro": "Taraxacum officinale subsp. dens-leonis, commonly known as the dense-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its basal rosette of thick, hairy, and often dark green leaves. It produces a single, elongated flowering stem that bears a cluster of small, yellow composite flowers, which later develop into fluffy white seed heads. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, often thriving in disturbed soils and sunny areas. It is known for its deep taproot, which allows it to survive in various soil types and environmental conditions. The dense-leaved dandelion is also notable for its medicinal properties, traditionally used for its diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects."
