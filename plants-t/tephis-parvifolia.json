    "intro": "Tephis parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved tephis, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a feature typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth. Tephis parvifolia is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
