    "intro": "Triticum persicum var. rubiginosum, commonly known as the crimson wheat, is a cultivated variety of wheat characterized by its distinctive red grain color. It is native to the Middle East and has been historically grown for its high protein content and nutritional value. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear small, two-lobed florets, which are tightly clustered. The seeds, which are rich in gluten, are used in traditional baking and have cultural significance in certain regions."
