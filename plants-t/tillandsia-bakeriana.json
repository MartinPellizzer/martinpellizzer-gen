    "intro": "Tillandsia bakeriana, commonly known as the Baker's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has dense, fibrous roots that help anchor it to its host and absorb moisture from the air. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, forming a rosette that holds water. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal."
