    "intro": "Talauma coco, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a tall, tropical tree native to the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It has a slender trunk covered in fibrous husk and produces large, spiky fruits called coconuts. The plant's leaves are large, feather-like, and can reach up to 4 meters in length. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize the soil in coastal areas. The coconut fruit contains both a liquid endosperm and a solid white kernel, which are used in various culinary and industrial applications."
