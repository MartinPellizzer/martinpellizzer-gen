    "intro": "Taraxacum luridum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant species native to eastern North America. It belongs to the dandelion family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant produces a large, showy composite flower head. Taraxacum luridum is often mistaken for common dandelions but can be distinguished by its more robust stature and yellowish-green coloration."
