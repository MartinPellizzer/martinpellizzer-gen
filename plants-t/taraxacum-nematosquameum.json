    "intro": "Taraxacum nematosquameum, commonly known as the squamose dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that produces a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its flowers develop into a fluffy, white pappus that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. The species is notable for its distinctive leaf morphology, with the undersides covered in fine, scale-like hairs."
