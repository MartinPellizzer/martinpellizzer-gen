    "intro": "Thymus semilei, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color and emit a strong, pungent scent when crushed. The plant produces tiny, pink or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in horticulture for both its fragrance and visual appeal."
