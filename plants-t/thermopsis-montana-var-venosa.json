    "intro": "Thermopsis montana var. venosa, commonly known as the hairy thermopsis, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy foliage and is often found in rocky or well-drained soils. It is a member of the legume family (Fabaceae) and possesses the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
