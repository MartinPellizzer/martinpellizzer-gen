    "intro": "Turraea nilotica, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded areas of forests. Turraea nilotica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some African cultures."
