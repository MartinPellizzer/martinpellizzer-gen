    "intro": "Thysselinum palustre var. sylvestre, commonly known as the swamp thyselinum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to saturated soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, producing pale green to yellowish blooms that appear in late spring to early summer. The species is adapted to nutrient-poor, waterlogged environments and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
