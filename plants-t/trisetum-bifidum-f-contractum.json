    "intro": "Trisetum bifidum f. contractum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood sedge, is a compact, perennial grass-like plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed compared to the typical form of Trisetum bifidum. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its compact growth habit and dense foliage make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and habitat creation."
