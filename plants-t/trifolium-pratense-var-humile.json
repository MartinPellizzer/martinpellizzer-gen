    "intro": "Trifolium pratense var. humile, commonly known as the lesser red clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in early spring. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. This variety is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides, contributing to soil nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
