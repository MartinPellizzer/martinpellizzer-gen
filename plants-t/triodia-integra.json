    "intro": "Triodia integra, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and the presence of sharp, spiny leaves. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and fire resistance. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce minute flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Triodia integra plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native fauna."
