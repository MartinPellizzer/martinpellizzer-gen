    "intro": "Triodia intermedia, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its wiry, spiky foliage and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant forms dense, low-growing tussocks that help stabilize sandy soils. It plays an important role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various desert animals. Triodia intermedia is also used in traditional Aboriginal land management practices."
