    "intro": "Trifolium atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic clover, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and dunes, where it thrives in salty and windy conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, and its trifoliate leaves are characteristic of the clover genus. It is often found in maritime climates and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Trifolium atlanticum plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local wildlife."
