    "intro": "Trisetum labradoricum, commonly known as Labrador sedge, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, sandy or gravelly soils in tundra and boreal forest habitats. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Labrador sedge produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are pollinated by wind. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its cold, harsh environment."
