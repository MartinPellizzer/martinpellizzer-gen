It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of bright red, tubular flowers resembling small flames. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Due to its striking appearance and ecological value, it is a popular choice for native gardens and conservation efforts."
