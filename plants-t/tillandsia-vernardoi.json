    "intro": "Tillandsia vernardoi, commonly known as the Vernard's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant possesses rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, adding to its ornamental value. Due to its unique adaptations, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in humid environments."
