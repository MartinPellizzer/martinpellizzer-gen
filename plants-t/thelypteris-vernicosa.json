    "intro": "Thelypteris vernicosa, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that often appear glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves. Thelypteris vernicosa thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
