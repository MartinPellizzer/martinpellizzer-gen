    "intro": "Tarenna sechellensis, commonly known as the Seychelles tarenna, is a flowering plant native to the Seychelles archipelago. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and smooth, dark green leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tarenna sechellensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
