    "intro": "Taraxacum subguttulosum, commonly known as the spotted dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single flower head. The flowers are yellow and consist of both ray and disk florets, typical of the dandelion genus. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and disturbed soils. It produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism with a pappus, allowing seeds to be carried by the wind."
