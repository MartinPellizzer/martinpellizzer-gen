    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 zirnichianus, commonly known as the Zirnichian thyme, is a hybrid species within the genus Thymus, known for its aromatic foliage and compact growth habit. It originates from the cross between Thymus citriodorus and Thymus ziri, resulting in a plant that exhibits a blend of characteristics from both parent species. The leaves are small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a soft, textured appearance. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. This plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun."
