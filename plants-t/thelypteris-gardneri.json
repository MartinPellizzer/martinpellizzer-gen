    "intro": "Thelypteris gardneri, commonly known as Gardner's water fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically borne on creeping rhizomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris gardneri plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of its wetland habitats."
