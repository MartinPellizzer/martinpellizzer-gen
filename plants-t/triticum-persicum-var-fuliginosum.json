    "intro": "Triticum persicum var. fuliginosum, commonly known as Persian wheat or black wheat, is a wild grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black-colored grains, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are small and hard, with a high protein content, making them valuable for both culinary and traditional medicinal uses. The species is also noted for its adaptability to arid and semi-arid environments."
