    "intro": "Tanacetum argenteum subsp. argenteum, commonly known as silverleaf tansy, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in flat-topped inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its aromatic leaves and flowers have been used historically in herbal medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
