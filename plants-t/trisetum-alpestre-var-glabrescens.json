    "intro": "Trisetum alpestre var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and slender, tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually glabrous, or smooth, and the plant is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Trisetum alpestre var. glabrescens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
