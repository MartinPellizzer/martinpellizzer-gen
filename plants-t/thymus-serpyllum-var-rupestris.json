It features small, fragrant leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for ground cover in gardens and rocky landscapes. The leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its aromatic properties and medicinal uses."
