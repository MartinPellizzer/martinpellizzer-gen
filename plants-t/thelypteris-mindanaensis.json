It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint blue-green glow in the dark. The plant thrives in wet, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The species is notable for its unique adaptation to low-light conditions and its role in the ecological balance of its habitat."
