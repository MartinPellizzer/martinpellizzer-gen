    "intro": "Tanacetum dolichophyllum, commonly known as the long-leaved tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant features slender, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its yellow flowers are typically arranged in flat-topped clusters. Tanacetum dolichophyllum is known for its strong, camphor-like scent, which is produced by volatile compounds in its leaves and flowers. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas."
