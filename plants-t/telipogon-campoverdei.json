    "intro": "Telipogon campoverdei, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests or rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
