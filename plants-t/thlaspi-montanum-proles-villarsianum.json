    "intro": "Thlaspi montanum proles villarsianum, commonly known as the alpine cabbages, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, where it tolerates cold and nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are usually covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with four petals arranged in a cross shape, a typical feature of the Brassicaceae family."
