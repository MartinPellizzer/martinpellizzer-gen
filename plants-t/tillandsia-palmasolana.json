    "intro": "Tillandsia palmasolana, commonly known as the Palm Solana Tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually long and narrow, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. It produces striking inflorescences with showy, violet or purple flowers that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds."
