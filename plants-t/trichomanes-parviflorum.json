    "intro": "Trichomanes parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered maidenhair fern, is a member of the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a delicate, epiphytic fern that thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has finely divided, feathery fronds with a distinctive, pale green coloration. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Trichomanes parviflorum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
