    "intro": "Tongoloa loloensis, commonly known as the Lolo tongue plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its stems are woody and branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tongoloa loloensis is considered a vulnerable species."
