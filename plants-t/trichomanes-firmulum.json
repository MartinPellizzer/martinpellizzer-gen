    "intro": "Trichomanes firmulum, commonly known as the firm moss, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant has a unique structure with closely spaced, overlapping pinnae that give it a dense, moss-like appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in crevices. Trichomanes firmulum is notable for its intricate, finely divided leaves and its ability to retain moisture in its habitat."
