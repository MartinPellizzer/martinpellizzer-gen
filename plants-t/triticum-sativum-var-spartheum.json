    "intro": "Triticum sativum var. spartheum, commonly known as the spikelet wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence structure, featuring compact, spikelet-like clusters of florets. This variety is primarily of interest in botanical studies due to its morphological distinctiveness. It typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in wild or weedy habitats. The plant's genetic makeup offers insights into the evolutionary adaptations of wheat species."
