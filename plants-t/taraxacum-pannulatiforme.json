    "intro": "Taraxacum pannulatiforme, commonly known as the pannulate dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leaf-like stem that supports a flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, spherical seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in temperate regions and is often found in open, disturbed soils. Taraxacum pannulatiforme is notable for its adaptability and is considered a common weed in many parts of the world."
