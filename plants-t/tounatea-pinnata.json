    "intro": "Tounatea pinnata, commonly known as the giant fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its reproductive structures include spores, which are dispersed by wind, allowing for wide distribution. Tounatea pinnata plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
