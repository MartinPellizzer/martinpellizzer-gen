    "intro": "Trisetum alpestre var. aureum, commonly known as the golden alpine feathergrass, is a variant of the alpine feathergrass species native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage with a distinctive golden hue, particularly noticeable in its inflorescence. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and wiry, while its flowering stems bear small, spike-like clusters of pale yellow to golden flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, mountainous environments."
