It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically gray-green in color, and it produces tiny pink or white flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover. Its aromatic properties make it useful in culinary and medicinal applications. The varietal name 'anander' refers to its distinct growth habit and compact form compared to other thyme varieties."
