    "intro": "Turia cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage with elliptical, dark green leaves that are often heart-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its compact size and attractive appearance, it is often used in rock gardens or as a container plant."
