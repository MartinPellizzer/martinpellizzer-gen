    "intro": "Tectaria novopommeranica, commonly known as the New Pommeranian tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds, which are usually bipinnate and have a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The species is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines."
