    "intro": "Thelypteris hutchisonii, commonly known as the Hutchinson's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, shield-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris hutchisonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
