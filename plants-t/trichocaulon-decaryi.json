    "intro": "Trichocaulon decaryi, commonly known as the Decary's beardgrass, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Trichocaulon decaryi is considered a rare and endemic species."
