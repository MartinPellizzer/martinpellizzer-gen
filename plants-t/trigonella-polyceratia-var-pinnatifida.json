    "intro": "Trigonella polyceratia var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fenugreek, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branched stems and trifoliate leaves with a distinctive pinnatifid (broadly lobed) appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by cylindrical, hairy pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a spice."
