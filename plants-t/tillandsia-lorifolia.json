    "intro": "Tillandsia lorifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically broad and grass-like, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale blue in color. It is well adapted to humid environments and can thrive in indirect sunlight."
