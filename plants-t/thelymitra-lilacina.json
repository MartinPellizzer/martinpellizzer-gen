It is characterized by its striking lilac-colored flowers and is typically found in heathlands and open forests. The plant has a short, erect stem with a few leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers during the spring season. Thelymitra lilacina is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. It is considered a rare and protected species due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
