    "intro": "Thymus boissieri var. ciliatopubescens, commonly known as the ciliated-hairy thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It features compact, creeping stems covered in fine, hairy foliage that gives it its varietal name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in early summer. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, making it valuable for both culinary and medicinal uses. This variety is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in full sun conditions."
