It features small, oval leaves that are typically arranged in a prostrate or creeping manner along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pods containing several round, brown seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species for dry regions. Its botanical characteristics make it useful for soil stabilization and as a forage plant in certain agricultural systems."
