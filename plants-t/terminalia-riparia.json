    "intro": "Terminalia riparia, commonly known as the river mangrove or African mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the floodplains of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and elongated, drooping leaves that help reduce water loss in its wetland habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, round fruits that are an important food source for various animals. Its roots form a dense network that stabilizes riverbanks and prevents erosion. Terminalia riparia is well adapted to fluctuating water levels and saline conditions, making it a key species in riparian ecosystems."
