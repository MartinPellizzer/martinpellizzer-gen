    "intro": "Tillaea acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-tipped tillaea, is a small, mat-forming succulent native to the rocky coastal areas of southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with red or purple, and its leaves are narrow, pointed, and covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the winter months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Tillaea acuminata is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
