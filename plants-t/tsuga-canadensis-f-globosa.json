    "intro": "Tsuga canadensis f. globosa, commonly known as the globe fir, is a rare and distinctive variant of the eastern hemlock. It is characterized by its densely clustered, globe-shaped cones and shorter, more compact growth habit compared to the typical eastern hemlock. The foliage is dark green and dense, with a soft, feathery texture. This form is often found in shaded, moist environments, typically in the understory of forests. Its unique appearance makes it a valuable specimen for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
