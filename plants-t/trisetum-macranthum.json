    "intro": "Trisetum macranthum, commonly known as the giant tussock grass, is a tall perennial grass native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces large, showy panicles of flowers in late summer. Trisetum macranthum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
