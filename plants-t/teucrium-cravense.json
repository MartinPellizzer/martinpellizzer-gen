    "intro": "Teucrium cravense, commonly known as Cravens' germander, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, tubular flowers are usually blue to purple in color, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Teucrium cravense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
