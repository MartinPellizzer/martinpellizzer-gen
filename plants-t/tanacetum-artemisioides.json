    "intro": "Tanacetum artemisioides, commonly known as sweet everlasting, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves and small, yellowish-green flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces a strong, aromatic scent, particularly when the leaves are crushed, which is due to the presence of essential oils. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Tanacetum artemisioides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
