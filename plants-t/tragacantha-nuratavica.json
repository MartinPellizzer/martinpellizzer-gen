    "intro": "Tragacantha nuratavica, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellowish flowers in spring, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Its most notable feature is the production of a viscous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
