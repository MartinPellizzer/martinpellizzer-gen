    "intro": "Tapinanthus kerstingii, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it attaches to the roots of other plants to obtain some of its nutrients. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host plants."
