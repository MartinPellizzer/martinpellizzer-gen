    "intro": "Thuja occidentalis var. compacta, commonly known as the Northern white cedar or American arborvitae, is a compact, pyramidal evergreen shrub native to eastern North America. It features scale-like leaves that are closely packed, giving it a dense, textured appearance. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It is well-suited for ornamental landscaping due to its slow growth and adaptability to various soil types. This variety is often used as a hedge or foundation plant in gardens and landscapes."
