    "intro": "Tithymalus amygdaloides subsp. arbuscula, commonly known as the rock thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to rocky and arid regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It features compact, cushion-like growth with small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its horticultural value lies in its resilience and ornamental appeal, though it is not widely cultivated outside its native range."
