    "intro": "Taxus pectinata, commonly known as the Pacific yew, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its reddish bark, needle-like leaves, and small, dark blue berries. The plant is notable for its slow growth and longevity, with some specimens living over 1,000 years. Its wood is lightweight and strong, historically used for construction and furniture. However, the tree is also valued for its taxol content, which has significant applications in cancer treatment."
