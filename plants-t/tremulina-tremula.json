    "intro": "Tremulina tremula, commonly known as the trembling willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, woody capsules that contain its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. The trembling willow is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
