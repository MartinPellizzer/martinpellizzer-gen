    "intro": "Taraxacum shikokianum, commonly known as the Shikoku dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Japan, specifically the Shikoku region, and is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
