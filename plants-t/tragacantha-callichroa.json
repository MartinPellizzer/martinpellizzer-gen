    "intro": "Tragacantha callichroa, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southwestern Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of distinctive, spiny capsules containing seeds. Its latex sap, known as tragacanth, has been historically used in various medicinal and industrial applications. Tragacantha callichroa is well adapted to dry climates and can thrive in poor soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
