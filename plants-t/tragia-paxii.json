    "intro": "Tragia paxii, commonly known as the Mexican burr plant, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny capsules containing seeds. Tragia paxii is often found in dry, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It is sometimes considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread through its persistent seeds."
