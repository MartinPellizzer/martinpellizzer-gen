    "intro": "Trianthema sedifolium var. microphyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandbur, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, linear leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is an annual herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its seeds are encased in spiny burs, which aid in dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. The species is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its succulent stems and reduced leaf surface."
