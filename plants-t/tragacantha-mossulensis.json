It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is notable for producing a resinous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
