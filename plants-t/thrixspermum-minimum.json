    "intro": "Thrixspermum minimum, commonly known as the dwarf thrixspermum, is a small, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, compact growth with small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, red berries. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
