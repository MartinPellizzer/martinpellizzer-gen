    "intro": "Torreya nucifera f. radicans, commonly known as the spreading Chinese nutmeg, is a variant of the Chinese torreya, characterized by its distinctive, spreading growth habit. This plant is a deciduous evergreen with long, narrow leaves that are often slightly waxy in texture. It produces small, fragrant flowers followed by edible, nut-like fruits that are highly valued in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Japan. Its unique morphology and medicinal properties make it a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticulture."
