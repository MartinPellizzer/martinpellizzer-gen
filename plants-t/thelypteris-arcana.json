    "intro": "Thelypteris arcana, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically evergreen and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spore-producing sorus is located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris arcana plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
