    "intro": "Triticum pyramidale var. pseudodiyabekiricum, commonly known as the Diyarbak\u0131r wheat, is a wild wheat species native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like structure with long, narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid conditions. Its seeds are small and have a hard, protective outer layer, which aids in survival in harsh environments. This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and resilience to climate stress."
