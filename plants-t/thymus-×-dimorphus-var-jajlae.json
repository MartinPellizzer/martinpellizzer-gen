    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 dimorphus var. jajlae, commonly known as the Jajla thyme, is a hybrid perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features aromatic, narrow-lanceolate leaves that are densely covered with glandular hairs, contributing to its strong thyme scent. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters atop the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
