It is characterized by its striking, spiky blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and saline soils, showing a high tolerance for salt and wind. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Turricula is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
