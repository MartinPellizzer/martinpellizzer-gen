    "intro": "Trichomanes strigosum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are covered with a dense layer of short, hairy structures. This plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread along the surface of its substrate. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinct pattern on the underside of the fronds."
