    "intro": "Thymus lipskyi, commonly known as the Liskyi thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, aromatic leaves and pink to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its foliage is used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, similar to other thyme species. Thymus lipskyi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
