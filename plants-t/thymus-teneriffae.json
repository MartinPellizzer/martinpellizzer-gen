    "intro": "Thymus teneriffae, commonly known as Canary Island thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its low-growing, woody stems and small, aromatic leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces pink to purple flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its resilience to drought and coastal conditions makes it a valuable plant in Mediterranean and subtropical climates."
