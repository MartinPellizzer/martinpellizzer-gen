    "intro": "Tectaria pulchra, commonly known as the elegant shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with a dense covering of small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Tectaria pulchra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
