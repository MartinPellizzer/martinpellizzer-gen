    "intro": "Taraxacum miniatum, commonly known as the miniature dandelion, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a short, sturdy stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, typical of the Compositae family. It produces a small, spherical seed head that releases wind-dispersed seeds, a common adaptation in the genus Taraxacum. This species is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, showcasing its resilience and adaptability."
