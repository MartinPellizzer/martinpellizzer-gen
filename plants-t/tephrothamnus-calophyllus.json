    "intro": "Tephrothamnus calophyllus, commonly known as the silver-leaf tephrothamnus, is a shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its silvery, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Tephrothamnus calophyllus is often found in fynbos vegetation, contributing to the biodiversity of the region."
