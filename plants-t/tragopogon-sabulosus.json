    "intro": "Tragopogon sabulosus, commonly known as the beach thistle, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a rough texture, adapted to withstand coastal conditions. Tragopogon sabulosus plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small insects and birds."
