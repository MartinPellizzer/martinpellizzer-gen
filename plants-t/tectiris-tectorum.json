    "intro": "Tectiris tectorum, commonly known as the common tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a narrow, elongated shape. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Tectiris tectorum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
