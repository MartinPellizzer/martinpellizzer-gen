    "intro": "Tinus squamulosa, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, scale-like hairs. Its small, pea-shaped flowers are typically pale yellow or white, and it produces legumes as its fruit. Tinus squamulosa is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
