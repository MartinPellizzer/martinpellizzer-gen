    "intro": "Trifolium constantinopolitanum var. plumosum, commonly known as the plumose Persian clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are composed of three oval-shaped leaflets with a distinctive silvery-white underside. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and for forage."
