It belongs to the family Turgoseaceae and is native to the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere. The plant features broad, ovate leaves covered in a thick layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically in shades of pale yellow to green, and bloom during the spring and early summer. Turgosea tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
