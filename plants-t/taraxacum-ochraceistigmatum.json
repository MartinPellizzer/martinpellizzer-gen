It is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets and a distinctive, fluffy white seed head that disperses its seeds by wind. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are basal, alternate, and have a rough, hairy texture. The species is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, where it often thrives in temperate climates."
