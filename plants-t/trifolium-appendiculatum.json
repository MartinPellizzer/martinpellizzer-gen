    "intro": "Trifolium appendiculatum, commonly known as the appendiculate clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. Native to regions of Europe and western Asia, it thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its ecological importance, it serves as a valuable food source for pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
