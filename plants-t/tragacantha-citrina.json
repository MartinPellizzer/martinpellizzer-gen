    "intro": "Tragacantha citrina, commonly known as the yellow tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces a sticky, resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Tragacantha citrina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
