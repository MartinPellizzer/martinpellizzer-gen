    "intro": "Taraxacum reclinans, commonly known as the reclining dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves that often lie flat on the ground. The plant produces a single, slender stem that rises to bear a yellow flower head, which later develops into a fluffy white pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and open fields. This species is native to Europe and western Asia, and it is considered a common weed in many regions."
