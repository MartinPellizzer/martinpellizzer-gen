    "intro": "Torilis crinita, commonly known as the hairy orache, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in a three-lobed capsule that splits open when mature to release the seeds. Torilis crinita is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and wastelands."
