    "intro": "Talayotea, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a yellow or orange throat. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, humid environments. Talayotea thrives in sandy soils near the coast and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its ability to tolerate salt spray makes it a hardy choice for coastal landscapes."
