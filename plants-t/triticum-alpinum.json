    "intro": "Triticum alpinum, commonly known as alpine wheat, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces awned spikelets that contain minute grains, which are typically wind-pollinated. Triticum alpinum thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
