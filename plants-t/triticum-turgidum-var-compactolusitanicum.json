    "intro": "Triticum turgidum var. compactolusitanicum, commonly known as the compact wild wheat, is a wild species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, glume-like bracts that enclose the florets. The plant produces spikelets that are tightly clustered, which is a distinguishing feature from other wheat varieties. Its botanical structure includes a short, sturdy stem with alternate leaves that are narrow and linear. This variety is often studied for its potential in agricultural breeding programs due to its genetic diversity and adaptability."
