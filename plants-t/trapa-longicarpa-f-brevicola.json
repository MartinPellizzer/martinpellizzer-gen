    "intro": "Trapa longicarpa f. brevicola, commonly known as the short-stemmed water chestnut, is a variant of the water chestnut plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stems compared to the typical form of Trapa longicarpa. The plant produces floating leaves with long, narrow petioles and bears distinctive spiny fruits that mature underwater. Its botanical features make it well adapted to aquatic environments, where it thrives in shallow, still waters. This fern-like plant is often found in wetlands and can be an indicator of nutrient-rich aquatic habitats."
