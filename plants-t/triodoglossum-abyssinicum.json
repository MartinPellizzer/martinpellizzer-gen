It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, mountainous regions and thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change. Botanists study it to better understand its ecological role and potential for conservation efforts."
