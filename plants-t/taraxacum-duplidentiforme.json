    "intro": "Taraxacum duplidentiforme, commonly known as the double-toothed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a flowering head that produces numerous yellow ray florets. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in various environmental conditions. The seeds are dispersed by wind, with each seed attached to a fluffy pappus that aids in aerial transport."
