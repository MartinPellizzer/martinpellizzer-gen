    "intro": "Trifolium franciscanum var. truncatum, commonly known as the Franciscan Trifoliate, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of California. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically composed of three rounded leaflets with a truncate or cut-off tip. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters along the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
