    "intro": "Typha minima var. gracilis, commonly known as slender bulrush, is a wetland plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical flower spikes. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into cylindrical seed heads. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for aquatic life. This variety is distinguished from other Typha species by its slender, more delicate appearance and shorter stature."
