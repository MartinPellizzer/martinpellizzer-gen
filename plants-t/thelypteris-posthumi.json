    "intro": "Thelypteris posthumi, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often pale green with a bluish tinge. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris posthumi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
