    "intro": "Taraxacum fragile, commonly known as the slender dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its delicate, upright stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a capsule containing numerous seeds with white, feathery pappi that aid in wind dispersal. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its botanical features make it a common yet often overlooked member of the dandelion genus."
