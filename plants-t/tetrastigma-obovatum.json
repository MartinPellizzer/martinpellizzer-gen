    "intro": "Tetrastigma obovatum, commonly known as the broad-ovate climbing vine, is a woody vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the grape family, Vitaceae, and is characterized by its tendrils that allow it to climb and spread across surfaces. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they often have a glossy appearance. Its small, greenish-white flowers are borne in clusters, and the plant produces small, round berries that are usually yellow or red when ripe. Tetrastigma obovatum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
