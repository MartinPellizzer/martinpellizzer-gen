    "intro": "Tinus canaliculata, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in swampy areas and along the edges of ponds. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves with prominent parallel veins and a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, blooming in early spring. Tinus canaliculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
