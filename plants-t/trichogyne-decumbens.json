    "intro": "Trichogyne decumbens, commonly known as the creeping trichogyne, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are typically borne on long, slender peduncles. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Trichogyne decumbens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks."
