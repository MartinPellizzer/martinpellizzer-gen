    "intro": "Triglochin juncea, commonly known as slender swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps it thrive in waterlogged soils. Triglochin juncea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
