It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, aromatic leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its foliage is often used in culinary applications, similar to other thyme species, and it is also valued in traditional medicine. The plant's compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for garden landscaping."
