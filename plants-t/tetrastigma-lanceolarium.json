    "intro": "Tetrastigma lanceolarium, commonly known as the climbing raisin vine, is a woody vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its tendrils that enable it to climb and spread over other plants. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by clusters of red, fleshy berries that resemble grapes. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in humid, tropical environments. The berries are edible but often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
