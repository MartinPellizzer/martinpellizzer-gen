    "intro": "Trisetum altum, commonly known as tall hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and feathery, silver-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, three-branched spikelets. Trisetum altum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
