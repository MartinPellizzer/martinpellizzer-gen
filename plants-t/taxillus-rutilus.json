    "intro": "Taxillus rutilus, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees, such as oaks and pines. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by fleshy, sticky berries that attract birds for seed dispersal. Its parasitic nature makes it an important component of forest ecosystems, influencing host tree growth and biodiversity. Taxillus rutilus is also culturally significant, often associated with festive traditions in some regions."
