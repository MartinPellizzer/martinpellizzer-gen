    "intro": "Thlaspi arenarium, commonly known as sandstone cress, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. Native to arid and rocky habitats, it is well adapted to survive in dry, nutrient-poor soils. The plant has a short life cycle, typically flowering and setting seed within a single growing season. Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively."
