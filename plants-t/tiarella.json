    "intro": "Tiarella, commonly known as foamflower, is a genus of herbaceous plants native to eastern North America. These plants typically feature rhizomatous growth and are characterized by their clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The foliage consists of heart-shaped or lobed leaves that are often ornamental and provide visual interest throughout the growing season. Tiarella species are generally shade-tolerant and thrive in moist, well-drained soils. They are popular in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to naturalize in woodland settings."
