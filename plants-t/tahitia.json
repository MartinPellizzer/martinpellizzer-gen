    "intro": "Tahitia, commonly known as the Tahitian night-blooming cereus, is a striking flowering plant native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong, sweet scent to attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with ample sunlight. Tahitia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a symbol of the island's unique flora."
