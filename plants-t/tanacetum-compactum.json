    "intro": "Tanacetum compactum, commonly known as the button fern or compactum chrysanthemum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, compact growth with small, rounded leaves that form a tight rosette. The plant produces daisy-like flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
