    "intro": "Thelypteris \u00d7 boottii var. multiflora, commonly known as the multiflorous shield fern, is a hybrid fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spore cases on the undersides of its leaves, which contribute to its reproductive strategy. Its rhizomes are wiry and fibrous, allowing it to spread through vegetative propagation. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
