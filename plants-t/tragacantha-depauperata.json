    "intro": "Tragacantha depauperata, commonly known as the poorflower tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a distinctive resinous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a binding agent. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
