    "intro": "Tussilago laevigata, commonly known as smooth-leaved lungwort, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of smooth, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of hair, giving them a velvety texture. Tussilago laevigata is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential respiratory benefits."
