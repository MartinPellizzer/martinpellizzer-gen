    "intro": "Tolpis succulenta subsp. pectinata, commonly known as the Cape honeysuckle, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and opposite, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent tissues to survive drought conditions. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
