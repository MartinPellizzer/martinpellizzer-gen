    "intro": "Trionum cordifolium, commonly known as heartleaf trailing arum, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Trionum cordifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
