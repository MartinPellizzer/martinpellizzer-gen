    "intro": "Trillium camschatcense f. plenum, commonly known as the full-leaved white trillium, is a rare and striking plant native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its three large, waxy white petals and three broad, heart-shaped leaves that are fully expanded from the start. The plant blooms in early spring, typically in moist, shaded forest habitats. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
