    "intro": "Tephrosia reptans var. reptans, commonly known as creeping tephrosia, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, followed by narrow, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and open woodlands. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
