    "intro": "Trillium grandiflorum f. striatum, commonly known as the striped white trillium, is a rare and striking variant of the white trillium. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, white petals with prominent red or pink veins that create a striped appearance. This plant is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded woodlands. It features three broad, heart-shaped leaves and produces a single, showy white flower with three sepals. The striped pattern is a result of genetic variation and is a notable feature in its floral morphology."
