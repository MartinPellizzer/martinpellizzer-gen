    "intro": "Terniopsis ubonensis, commonly known as the Ubon fern, is a rare tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Terniopsidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive. Its reproductive structures are unique, featuring small, spore-producing capsules that are clustered along the stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Terniopsis ubonensis is considered a conservation concern."
