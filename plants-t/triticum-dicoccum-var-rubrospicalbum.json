    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum var. rubrospicalbum, commonly known as spelt, is a hexaploid wheat species native to the Fertile Crescent. It is characterized by its awned spikelets and hard, inedible glumes that enclose the grains. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with alternate, linear leaves and a panicle-like inflorescence. Its seeds are small, oval, and often have a distinctive red or brown coloration. This variety is valued for its nutritional content and is used in both traditional and modern baking applications."
