    "intro": "Trophis scandens, commonly known as the climbing tephrosia, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often blooming in the summer months. Its fruits are pods that split open to release small, hard seeds. Trophis scandens is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and ability to climb trellises or other structures."
