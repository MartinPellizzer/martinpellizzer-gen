    "intro": "Taraxacum leucanthum, commonly known as the whitehead dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, pale green leaves and a yellow flower head that transitions to a white pappus for seed dispersal. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant is perennial, with a taproot system that allows it to survive in various environmental conditions. Its flowers bloom in early spring, contributing to its role in early pollination networks."
