    "intro": "Torreyochloa viridis, commonly known as the green torreygrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
