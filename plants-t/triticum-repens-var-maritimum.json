    "intro": "Triticum repens var. maritimum, commonly known as sea grass or beachgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand salty, windy conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellow flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often used in coastal stabilization efforts. Its rhizomatous growth helps prevent erosion and supports local biodiversity in maritime environments."
