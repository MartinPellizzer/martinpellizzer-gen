    "intro": "Thalia dichotoma, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in saltwater environments, such as mangrove swamps and coastal dunes. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its showy, yellow flowers are borne in clusters and bloom throughout the year. Thalia dichotoma plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
