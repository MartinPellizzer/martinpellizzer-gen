    "intro": "Trichelostylis coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed stiltroot, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its unique stilt roots that help it anchor in wetland or swampy environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to the moist conditions of its habitat. Trichelostylis coarctata is often found in freshwater swamps and is an important component of the local flora."
