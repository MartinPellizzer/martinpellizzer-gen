    "intro": "Triplectrum radicans, commonly known as the creeping triplefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
