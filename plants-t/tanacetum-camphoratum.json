    "intro": "Tanacetum camphoratum, commonly known as camphor tea or camphor tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flower heads. The plant is known for its strong, aromatic scent, which is attributed to its high content of essential oils, particularly camphor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
