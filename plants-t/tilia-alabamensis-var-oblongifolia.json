    "intro": "Tilia alabamensis var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the Alabama basswood, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically larger and more elongated compared to other species in the Tilia genus. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, fuzzy fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a tendency to develop shallow fissures as the tree matures. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland areas."
