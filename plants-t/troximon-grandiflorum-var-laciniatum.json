Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect sunlight. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers during the spring and summer months, adding to its ornamental value. Its foliage is evergreen, maintaining a lush green color throughout the year, making it a popular choice for shaded garden spaces. Due to its unique leaf structure, it is often used in botanical gardens and as a houseplant for its aesthetic appeal."
