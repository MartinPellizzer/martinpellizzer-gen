    "intro": "Trifolium campestre var. pallidum, commonly known as the pale clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are usually pale green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
