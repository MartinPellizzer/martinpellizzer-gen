    "intro": "Tweedia stipitata, commonly known as the African daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. Tweedia stipitata thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring to early autumn."
