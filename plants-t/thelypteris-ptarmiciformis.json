    "intro": "Thelypteris ptarmiciformis, commonly known as the silver shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually arching and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to woodland landscapes."
