    "intro": "Thermopsis rhombifolia var. arenosa, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, rhomboid-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to hot, dry environments. It is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
