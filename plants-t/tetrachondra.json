    "intro": "Tetrachondra, commonly known as the marsh holly or water holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Onagraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. The plants are characterized by their small, often white or pink flowers and their ability to thrive in waterlogged soils. They have narrow, linear leaves and typically grow in dense clusters. Tetrachondra species are valued for their ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
