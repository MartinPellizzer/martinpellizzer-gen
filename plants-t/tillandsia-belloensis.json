    "intro": "Tillandsia belloensis, commonly known as the Bello's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with purple or red flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a sought-after species among bromeliad enthusiasts and conservationists."
