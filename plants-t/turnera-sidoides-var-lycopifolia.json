It is characterized by its bright orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant has opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges and a hairy texture. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded areas. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to produce fragrant, tubular flowers that attract pollinators."
