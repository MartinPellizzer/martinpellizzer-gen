    "intro": "Trifolium velenovskyi, commonly known as the Velenovsky's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Native to Central Asia, this plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility, and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. The plant's adaptability makes it an important component of its native ecosystems."
