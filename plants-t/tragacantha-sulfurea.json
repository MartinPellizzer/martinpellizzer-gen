    "intro": "Tragacantha sulfurea, commonly known as sulfur gum, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its yellowish-orange resinous exudate, which is harvested for commercial use. The plant typically grows as a shrub with woody stems and small, pea-like flowers. Its leaves are trifoliate, and it thrives in dry, sandy soils with minimal rainfall. The resin, known as tragacanth, has been used historically in medicine, food, and as a binding agent in various industries."
