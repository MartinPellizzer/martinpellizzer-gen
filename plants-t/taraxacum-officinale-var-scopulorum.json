    "intro": "Taraxacum officinale var. scopulorum, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and grayish-green in color. The plant produces a slender, hollow stem that supports a single, bright yellow composite flower head. Its flowers are followed by a distinctive, spiky seed head that disperses seeds via the wind. This variety is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in dry, limestone soils."
