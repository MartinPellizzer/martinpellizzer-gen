    "intro": "Tenoria protracta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tenoria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves.

Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
