    "intro": "Triticum speltoides var. schultzii, commonly known as Schultze's spelt, is a wild wheat species native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences that bear awned glumes. The plant produces small, hard grains that are typically brown or gray in color. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought conditions. This variety is of interest to researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity in wheat breeding programs."
