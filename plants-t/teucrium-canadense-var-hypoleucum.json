    "intro": "Teucrium canadense var. hypoleucum, commonly known as white germander, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy and have a slightly aromatic scent. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. This variety is distinguished from other Teucrium species by its lighter flower color and specific habitat preferences."
