    "intro": "Triticum caninum, commonly known as dog wheat, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. Its seeds are small and oval, often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop. Despite its potential uses, it is not widely cultivated for grain production compared to other wheat species."
