    "intro": "Tetraria pubescens, commonly known as the silky lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, velvety growth and a pale to bright green or yellowish color. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungal partner, which provides the plant with nutrients. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions. Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and air pollution."
