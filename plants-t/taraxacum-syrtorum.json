    "intro": "Taraxacum syrtorum, commonly known as the Syrtic dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the dandelion genus, which is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, while its flowers are yellow and form a single, short head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head with white, wind-dispersed seeds, similar to other dandelions."
