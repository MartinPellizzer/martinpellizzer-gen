    "intro": "Trisetum buschianum subsp. buschianum, commonly known as the Buschian hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained to wet soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its fine, hairy texture and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats."
