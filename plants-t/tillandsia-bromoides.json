    "intro": "Tillandsia bromoides, commonly known as the bromeliad tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that collect water and nutrients from the air, a characteristic adaptation to its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of white, pink, or purple. Tillandsia bromoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities in indoor gardening."
