It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests. It has simple, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish fruits that are adapted for bird dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
