    "intro": "Triticum monococcum var. rubrum, commonly known as red einkorn, is an ancient grain species native to the Fertile Crescent. It is a diploid wheat with a small genome size and is characterized by its reddish husk and high protein content. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and produces spikelets with awns. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the flowers are arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. The grain is harvested when the husks turn from green to a reddish-brown color, indicating maturity."
