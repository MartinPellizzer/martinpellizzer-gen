It produces striking blue to violet flowers in early spring, typically blooming from March to April. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in open habitats such as coastal scrub and chaparral. This variety is distinguished by its rough, scabrous texture on the leaves, which gives it its scientific name."
