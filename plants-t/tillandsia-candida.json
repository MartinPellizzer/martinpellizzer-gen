    "intro": "Tillandsia candida, commonly known as the silver vase, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding structure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. Tillandsia candida is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor environments."
