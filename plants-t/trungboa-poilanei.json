    "intro": "Trungboa poilanei, commonly known as the Vietnamese orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical forests of Vietnam. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees in its natural habitat. Its botanical features include long, slender leaves and a compact, pseudobulb-like structure that stores water and nutrients. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
