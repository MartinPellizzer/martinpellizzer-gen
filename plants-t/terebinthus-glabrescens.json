    "intro": "Terebinthus glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth terebinth, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds. Terebinthus glabrescens is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrublands and forest edges. Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of resin has contributed to its ecological and cultural significance."
