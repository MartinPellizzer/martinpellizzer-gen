    "intro": "Thelypodium rollinsii, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and are typically borne on tall, slender stems. The plant has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its fibrous root system allows it to anchor itself in sandy soils and access deep groundwater. Thelypodium rollinsii is adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a hardy species in xerophytic ecosystems."
