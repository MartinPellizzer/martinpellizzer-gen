    "intro": "Trochopteris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. These plants are characterized by their leathery, often evergreen fronds and are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Trochopteris species are known for their ability to thrive in rocky or calcareous soils, making them common in mountainous regions. The fronds are usually divided into small, pointed segments, and the spores are produced on the underside of the leaves. They play an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
