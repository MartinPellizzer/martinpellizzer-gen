    "intro": "Thelypteris menadensis, commonly known as the Menaden fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. The fronds are usually leathery and dark green, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
