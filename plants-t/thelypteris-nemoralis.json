    "intro": "Thelypteris nemoralis, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark green, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are typically divided into small, linear segments called pinnae. Thelypteris nemoralis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
