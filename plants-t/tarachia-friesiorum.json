    "intro": "Tarachia friesiorum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Tarachia friesiorum plays a vital role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
