It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy textures, which give it its common name. Triosteum hispidum is often found in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and in woodland edges."
