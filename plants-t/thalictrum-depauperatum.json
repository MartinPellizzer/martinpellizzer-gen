    "intro": "Thalictrum depauperatum, commonly known as the poorflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, lace-like foliage with finely divided leaves that create a fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in branched cymes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Thalictrum depauperatum is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ability to attract pollinators."
