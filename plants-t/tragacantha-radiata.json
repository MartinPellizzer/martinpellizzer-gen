    "intro": "Tragacantha radiata, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are alternate and pinnate, with a rough, hairy texture. Tragacantha radiata thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks."
