    "intro": "Toxicodendron paniculatum, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are bright green in summer and turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fuzzy berries. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woods. However, it contains urushiol, a toxic resin that can cause severe skin irritation in humans."
