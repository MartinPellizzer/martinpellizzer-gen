    "intro": "Thelypteris auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which aid in water absorption. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that give the plant a finely divided appearance."
