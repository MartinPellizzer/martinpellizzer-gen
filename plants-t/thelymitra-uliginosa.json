It typically grows in wet, boggy environments and is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves. The plant produces a single, showy spike of pale to dark purple flowers, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Thelymitra uliginosa is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems."
