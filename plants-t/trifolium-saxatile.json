    "intro": "Trifolium saxatile, commonly known as alpine clover, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. This plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate low nutrient conditions. Trifolium saxatile plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
