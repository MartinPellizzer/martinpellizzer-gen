    "intro": "Taraxacum ambigens var. fultius, commonly known as the broadleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lanceolate leaves. It produces a single, hollow, leaf-like stem that terminates in a yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and grasslands. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by the wind via a pappus structure. The species is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
