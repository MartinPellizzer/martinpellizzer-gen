    "intro": "Trachymene, commonly known as false thornapple, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their finely divided, fern-like leaves. They produce small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale purple, often arranged in umbels. Trachymene species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas. Some species are cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
