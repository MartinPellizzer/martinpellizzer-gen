    "intro": "Tulasneantha, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, bright yellow petals and a distinctive, elongated spur that houses its nectar. Tulasneantha typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed tropical ecosystems."
