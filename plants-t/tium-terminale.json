    "intro": "Tium terminale, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual with slender, trailing stems that often grow along the ground or climb low structures. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue to violet in color, opening in the morning and closing by midday. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its seeds are enclosed in small, papery pods. Tium terminale thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal habitats."
