    "intro": "Triticum thaoudar var. balansae, commonly known as the Balansae wheat, is a rare and ancient wheat species native to the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, slender grains and is typically found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is considered a wild relative of modern wheat, offering potential genetic resources for breeding programs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers."
