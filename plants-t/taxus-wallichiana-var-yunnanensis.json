    "intro": "Taxus wallichiana var. yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that contain toxic seeds, making it a valuable but hazardous species. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in temperate forests at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
