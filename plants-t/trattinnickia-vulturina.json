It is a perennial herb with distinctive, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant features a slender, branching stem and lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. It is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Trattinnickia vulturina is notable for its association with the death's-head hawkmoth, which feeds on its nectar."
