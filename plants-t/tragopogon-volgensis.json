    "intro": "Tragopogon volgensis, commonly known as the Hungarian dandelion, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and a tall, slender stem that bears a single yellow flower head. The plant produces a composite flower made up of many small florets, which develop into fluffy, white seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. Native to Central Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Tragopogon volgensis is known for its adaptability and is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range."
