    "intro": "Tonestus laceratus, commonly known as the fringed lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly branched thallus with a leathery texture and a pale to yellowish-green color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in temperate and boreal forest regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for air quality and ecological health."
