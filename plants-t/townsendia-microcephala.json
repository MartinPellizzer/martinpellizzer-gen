    "intro": "Townsendia microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed townsendia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. It is a perennial herb that thrives in full sun and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
