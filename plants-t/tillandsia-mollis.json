    "intro": "Tillandsia mollis, commonly known as the silver vane air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant has narrow, silver-green leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it collect and retain moisture from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale purple, adding ornamental value. Due to its low maintenance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
