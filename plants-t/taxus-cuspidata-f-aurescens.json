    "intro": "Taxus cuspidata f. aurescens, commonly known as the golden yew, is a rare and ornamental variant of the Japanese yew. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its dark green needles. This form is a naturally occurring mutation of the species, often found in shaded forest environments. The plant is slow-growing and has a compact, shrub-like habit. It is valued in horticulture for its unique coloration and evergreen nature."
