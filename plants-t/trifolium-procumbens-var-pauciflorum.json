    "intro": "Trifolium procumbens var. pauciflorum, commonly known as the low-growing clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. It is typically found in moist, acidic soils in woodland or grassland habitats. This variety is less floriferous than other clover species, hence its name \"pauciflorum,\" meaning \"few-flowered.\""
