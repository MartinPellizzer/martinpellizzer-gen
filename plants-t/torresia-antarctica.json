    "intro": "Torresia antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic torresia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southernmost regions of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, waxy leaves adapted to withstand extreme cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in rocky, coastal environments and is often found in areas with strong winds and limited soil. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered an important species for studying plant survival in harsh climates."
