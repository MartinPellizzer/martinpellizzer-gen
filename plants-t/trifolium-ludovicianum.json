    "intro": "Trifolium ludovicianum, commonly known as the Carolina clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by pods containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. Trifolium ludovicianum is valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
