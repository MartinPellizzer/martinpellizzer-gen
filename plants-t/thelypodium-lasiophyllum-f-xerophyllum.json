It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring or early summer. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to absorb moisture from the soil efficiently. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to harsh, drought-prone conditions."
