It belongs to the family Tripteridaceae and is characterized by its finely hairy, silvery-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, three-lobed fruits containing minute seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its unique foliage and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
