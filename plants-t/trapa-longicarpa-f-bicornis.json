    "intro": "Trapa longicarpa f. bicornis, commonly known as the two-horned water chestnut, is a variant of the water chestnut plant native to Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive two-horned spines on the fruit, which set it apart from other Trapa species. The plant thrives in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving rivers. Its leaves are submerged, while the floating flowers and fruit are adapted for water dispersal. The fruit, which is edible, contains a starchy seed that has been used in traditional cuisines."
