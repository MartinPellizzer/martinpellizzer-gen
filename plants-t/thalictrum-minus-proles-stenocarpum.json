It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers.

Its unique floral structure features numerous stamens and a single pistil, which is a distinguishing botanical trait. The fruit is a narrow, elongated capsule that dehisces to release its seeds."
