    "intro": "Trichocereus pasacana, commonly known as the Amazonian moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is often found growing in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers during the night, which is a notable botanical feature. Its scientific name reflects its unique morphology and geographic origin. Despite its appearance, it is not a true cactus but belongs to the genus Trichocereus, which includes several species with similar traits."
