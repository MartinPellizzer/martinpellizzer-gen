    "intro": "Taraxacum holmboei, commonly known as the Holmboe's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of central China, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that blooms in late spring. It produces a distinctive hollow stem that supports the flower and a capsule-like fruit that releases seeds with a white pappus. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
