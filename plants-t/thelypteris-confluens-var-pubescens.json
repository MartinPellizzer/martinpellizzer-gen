    "intro": "Thelypteris confluens var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a pubescent appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks or in dense forest understories. Its rhizomes are usually subterranean, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The leaves are pinnate, with a distinct midrib and small, lance-shaped pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
