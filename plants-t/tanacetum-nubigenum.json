    "intro": "Tanacetum nubigenum, commonly known as cloud fern or sky fern, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, airy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Tanacetum nubigenum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a ground cover."
