    "intro": "Trachydium kingdon-wardii, commonly known as the Kingdon-ward's trachydium, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in Nepal and northern India. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
