    "intro": "Troximon pterocarpum, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, curved pods containing flat, brown seeds. It is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Due to its ornamental value and durable wood, it is often cultivated in gardens and for timber."
