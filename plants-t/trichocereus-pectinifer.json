    "intro": "Trichocereus pectinifer, commonly known as the Pectinifer cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a trait common among many cacti in the Cactaceae family. Its stems are ribbed and covered with white, silky spines that provide protection from herbivores. Trichocereus pectinifer is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
