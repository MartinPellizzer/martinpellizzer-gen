    "intro": "Tragacantha procumbens var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth tragacanth, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features a sprawling growth habit with fleshy, succulent stems that help it retain water in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
