    "intro": "Trifolium noricum f. biceps, commonly known as the two-leaved mountain clover, is a rare and distinctive variant of the mountain clover species. It is characterized by its unique two-leaf morphology, which differs from the typical three-leaf structure of most Trifolium species. This plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found in rocky soils at high elevations. It produces small, pink or white flowers during the summer months, contributing to its ecological role in pollination. Its limited distribution and specialized habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
