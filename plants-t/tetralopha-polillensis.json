    "intro": "Tetralopha polillensis, commonly known as the Polill\u00e9an starling, is a unique plant species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in coastal areas. Its foliage has a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
