    "intro": "Tapinanthus sterculiae, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of other plants to derive some of its nutrients. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are alternate and heart-shaped, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing the growth of host plants."
