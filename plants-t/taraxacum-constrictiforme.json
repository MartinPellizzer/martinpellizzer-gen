    "intro": "Taraxacum constrictiforme, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, upright leaves and a flowering stem that is typically shorter than the leaves. The plant produces a single, yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy white pappus, aiding in wind pollination. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
