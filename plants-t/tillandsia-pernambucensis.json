    "intro": "Tillandsia pernambucensis, commonly known as the Pernambuco air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water and nutrients from the air. It produces small, colorful flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Tillandsia pernambucensis is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light to thrive."
