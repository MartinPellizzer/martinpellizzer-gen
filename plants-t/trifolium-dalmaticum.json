    "intro": "Trifolium dalmaticum, commonly known as Dalmatian clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the Balkans and parts of southern Europe, and it is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in early summer. Trifolium dalmaticum is a low-growing perennial that thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil fertility in agricultural and ecological contexts."
