    "intro": "Trisetum lobatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tuftgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly rolled at the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed florets. Trisetum lobatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, grass-like appearance."
