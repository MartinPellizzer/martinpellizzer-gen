    "intro": "Tunica prolifera, commonly known as the \"proliferating tunica,\" is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinct growth pattern. It is a type of liverwort, belonging to the family Porellaceae, and is known for its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant's structure consists of a central thallus covered with overlapping, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Tunica prolifera thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, contributing to its limited distribution and ecological niche."
