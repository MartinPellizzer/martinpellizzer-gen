    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 saxicola nothovar. pseudohumifusus, commonly known as the hybrid thyme, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features aromatic, narrow-lanceolate leaves covered in fine, grayish-white pubescence, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in early summer, typical of the Thymus genus. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
