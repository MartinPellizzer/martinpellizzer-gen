    "intro": "Trifolium fragiferum var. fragiferum, commonly known as the sweet clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slight serration along the edges. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Sweet clover is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it valuable in agricultural settings."
