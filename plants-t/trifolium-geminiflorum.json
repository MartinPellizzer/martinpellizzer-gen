    "intro": "Trifolium geminiflorum, commonly known as the twin-flower clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in pairs. Native to California, this species thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. The plant has a shallow root system that helps prevent soil erosion. It is also valued for its role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients."
