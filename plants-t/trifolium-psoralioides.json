    "intro": "Trifolium psoralioides, commonly known as the psoralioid clover, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, typical of the genus Trifolium. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its ecological role in nitrogen fixation, it plays a significant part in soil enrichment and biodiversity support."
