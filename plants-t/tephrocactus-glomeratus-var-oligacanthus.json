    "intro": "Tephrocactus glomeratus var. oligacanthus, commonly known as the clustered globose cactus, is a species native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the summer months. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
