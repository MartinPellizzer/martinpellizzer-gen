    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum grex farrum, commonly known as Farro, is an ancient grain that belongs to the wheat family (Poaceae). It is characterized by its short, sturdy stalks and small, hard grains that are typically amber to brown in color. The plant produces compact spikes with bracts that enclose the florets, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Farro is well adapted to temperate climates and is often grown in regions with cooler, moist conditions. It is valued for its high nutritional content and is used in both traditional and modern culinary applications."
