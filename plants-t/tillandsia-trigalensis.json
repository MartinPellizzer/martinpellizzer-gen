    "intro": "Tillandsia trigalensis, commonly known as the Trigalensis air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant that grows without soil, attaching itself to trees or other structures. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters. Tillandsia trigalensis is native to South America, particularly in regions with humid climates and ample sunlight."
