    "intro": "Trichomanes bojeri, commonly known as the Bojer's maidenhair, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern and have a distinctive, lace-like appearance. Trichomanes bojeri is native to tropical regions of Africa and is often found in shaded, moist environments."
