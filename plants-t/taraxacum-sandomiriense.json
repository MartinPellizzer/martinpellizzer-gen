    "intro": "Taraxacum sandomiriense, commonly known as the Sandomire dandelion, is a flowering plant native to South Korea. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flower head and heart-shaped basal leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy areas and is often found in forest margins or along stream banks. It produces a distinctive seed head that disperses its seeds via wind, a common adaptation in the Asteraceae family. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
