    "intro": "Thelypteris fuchsii, commonly known as the Fuchs' shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are usually smaller and more compact than the sterile ones. Thelypteris fuchsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
