    "intro": "Tamarix gallica var. heterophylla, commonly known as the pink tamarisk, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often pink or reddish in color. The plant produces fluffy, pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are highly attractive to pollinators. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
