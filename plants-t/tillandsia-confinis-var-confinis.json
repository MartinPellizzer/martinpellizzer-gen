    "intro": "Tillandsia confinis var. confinis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is well adapted to life in tropical forests. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
