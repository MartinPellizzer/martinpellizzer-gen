    "intro": "Thelypteris xingwenensis, commonly known as the Xingwen holly fern, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests. Its spores are released from the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. Thelypteris xingwenensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
