    "intro": "Thalictrum adianthifolium, commonly known as the fernleaf meadow-rue, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are typically borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Thalictrum adianthifolium is valued for its ornamental value and its role in supporting pollinators."
