    "intro": "Taraxacum vaitolahtense, commonly known as the Vaitolahten dandelion, is a rare and endemic species of the dandelion genus found primarily in Estonia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a distinctive, elongated stem with a pappus that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
