    "intro": "Tritonia hyalina, commonly known as the glassy tritonia, is a striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy, translucent coating. Tritonia hyalina blooms in spring, producing clusters of white or pale pink flowers that attract pollinators. It is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
