    "intro": "Tirucalia tirucalli, commonly known as the Natal milk tree, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds and can cause skin irritation. The plant has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and rocky areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes."
