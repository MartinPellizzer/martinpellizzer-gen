    "intro": "Trichosanthes wawrae f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy bitter melon, is a variant of the Trichosanthes genus native to southern China. It is a climbing vine characterized by its hairy stems and large, lobed leaves. The fruit is typically oblong, with a warty surface and a bitter taste, which is common among Trichosanthes species. It is often cultivated for its edible fruit, though it requires careful handling due to its toxicity. The plant is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
