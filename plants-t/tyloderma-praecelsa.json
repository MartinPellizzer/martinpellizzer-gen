    "intro": "Tyloderma praecelsa, commonly known as the giant puffball, is a rare and striking member of the Lycoper-saceae family. It is characterized by its large, white, fleshy fruiting body that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporocarps, are unique in their size and shape. Tyloderma praecelsa is primarily found in humid, lowland forests and is often associated with specific tree species in its ecosystem."
