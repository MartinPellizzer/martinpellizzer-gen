    "intro": "Taraxacum opacum, commonly known as the opacous dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, large, yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus, which consists of a tuft of white bristles. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as meadows and roadsides. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, sharing features with other dandelions and related plants."
