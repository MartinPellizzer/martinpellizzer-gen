    "intro": "Tillandsia globosa, commonly known as the globular air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped leaves that form a compact, globe-like structure, which helps it collect and retain moisture. Its leaves are covered in trichomes, specialized structures that absorb water and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia globosa is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
