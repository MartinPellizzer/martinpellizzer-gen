    "intro": "Trifolium watsonii, commonly known as Watson's clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on slender stems. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in racemes, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Watson's clover is a member of the legume family, capable of fixing nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
