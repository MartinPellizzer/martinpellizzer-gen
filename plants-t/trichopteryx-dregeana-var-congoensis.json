    "intro": "Trichopteryx dregeana var. congoensis, commonly known as the Congo sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Central Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
