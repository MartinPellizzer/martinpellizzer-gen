    "intro": "Thymus pumilus, commonly known as dwarf thyme, is a low-growing evergreen perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color and densely packed along its stems. The plant produces tiny, pink or white flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, give it both medicinal and culinary uses."
