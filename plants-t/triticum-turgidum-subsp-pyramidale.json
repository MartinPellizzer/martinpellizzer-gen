    "intro": "Triticum turgidum subsp. pyramidale, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences with small, two-lobed florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is also cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens."
