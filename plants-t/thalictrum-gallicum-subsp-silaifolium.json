    "intro": "Thalictrum gallicum subsp. silaifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically narrow and deeply divided, giving it a lacey appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in upright, branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to wetland gardens and ecological restoration projects."
