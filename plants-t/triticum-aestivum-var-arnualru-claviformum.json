    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. arnualru-claviformum, commonly known as the narrow-awned wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its distinctive awn morphology. This variety exhibits a unique combination of traits, including shorter and more rigid awns compared to standard wheat varieties. It is primarily cultivated for its adaptability to specific environmental conditions, such as drought or poor soil quality. The plant's botanical features include a robust root system and a compact growth habit, which contribute to its resilience. Its grain is typically used in niche agricultural applications or for breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience."
