    "intro": "Troglophyton leptomerum, commonly known as the cave beard lichen, is a unique lichen species that thrives in dark, humid cave environments. It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which together form a composite organism. The plant exhibits a crust-like growth form, adhering tightly to rock surfaces to maximize moisture retention. It is particularly adapted to low-light conditions, relying on the limited light that penetrates cave entrances. Its presence is often an indicator of stable, undisturbed cave ecosystems."
