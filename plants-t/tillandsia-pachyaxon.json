    "intro": "Tillandsia pachyaxon, commonly known as the thick-axis air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia pachyaxon is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
