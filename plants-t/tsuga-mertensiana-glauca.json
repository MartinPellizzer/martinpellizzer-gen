    "intro": "Tsuga mertensiana glauca, commonly known as the white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and blue-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are needle-like, typically measuring between 1 to 2 centimeters in length, and are arranged spirally along the branches. The cones are small, woody, and usually less than 2 centimeters in length, containing two to three seeds. This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in boreal forests and high-altitude areas."
