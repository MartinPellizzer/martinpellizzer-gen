    "intro": "Tillandsia mandonii, commonly known as the Mandon's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant possesses a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that help in absorbing moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white or pink. Tillandsia mandonii is well adapted to dry and sunny environments, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
