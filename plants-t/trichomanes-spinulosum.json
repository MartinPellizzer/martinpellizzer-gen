    "intro": "Trichomanes spinulosum, commonly known as the spinulose holly fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows on moist, shaded rock surfaces or tree trunks, thriving in humid environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes spinulosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
