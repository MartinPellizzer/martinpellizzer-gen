    "intro": "Themelium crenulatum, commonly known as the crested sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or marshy areas. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous greenish or brownish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Themelium crenulatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
