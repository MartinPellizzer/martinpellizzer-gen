It is a low-growing succulent with fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, known for its unique adaptations to drought conditions. Trachelanthus kurdicus is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to thrive with minimal water."
