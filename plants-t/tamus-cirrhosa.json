    "intro": "Tamus cirrhosa, commonly known as the woolly false lily, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
