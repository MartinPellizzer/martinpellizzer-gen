    "intro": "Taxus columnaris, commonly known as the Japanese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer characterized by its slender, columnar form. It features scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath, arranged in dense, flat sprays. The plant produces small, reddish-purple berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Native to Japan and Korea, it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often used in horticulture for landscaping purposes."
