    "intro": "Tillandsia lineata, commonly known as the silver vane air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant that grows without soil, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its specialized leaves. The plant is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a silvery, woolly coating that helps reduce water loss. Tillandsia lineata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
