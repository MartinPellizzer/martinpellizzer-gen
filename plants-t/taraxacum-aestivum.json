It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a bright yellow flower head. The plant is native to Europe but has been naturalized in many parts of the world, including North America. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas. The plant is known for its ability to produce a large number of seeds, which are dispersed by the wind through a fluffy, white pappus."
