    "intro": "Tectaria setulosa, commonly known as the hairy tectaria, is a fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and the presence of finely serrated, lanceolate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and the plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Tectaria setulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady gardens."
