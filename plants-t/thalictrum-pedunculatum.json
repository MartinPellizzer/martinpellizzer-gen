    "intro": "Thalictrum pedunculatum, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are arranged in elongated, drooping clusters called racemes, which are characteristic of the genus Thalictrum. It is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and stream banks, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
