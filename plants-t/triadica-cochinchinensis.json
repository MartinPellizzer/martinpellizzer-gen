    "intro": "Triadica cochinchinensis, commonly known as the glorybower, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and often have a distinctive three-part structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native flora."
