    "intro": "Telis velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes. Telis velutina is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an invasive species in many areas."
