It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds with silky hair, aiding in their dispersal. Tylophora laevigata is often found in tropical forests and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
