    "intro": "Trigonochilum alatum, commonly known as the winged orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped leaves and striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its unique wing-like structures on the stems are a notable botanical feature, aiding in water retention and structural support. Trigonochilum alatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
