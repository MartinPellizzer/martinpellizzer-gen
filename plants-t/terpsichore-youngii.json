    "intro": "Terpsichore youngii, commonly known as the Young's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often clustered at the base of the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and is protected in many regions."
