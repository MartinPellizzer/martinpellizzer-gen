    "intro": "Taraxacum plicatiangulatum, commonly known as the zigzag dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply pinnatifid leaves that create a zigzag pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seed heads, typical of the dandelion genus. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and thrives in moist, disturbed soils. Due to its unique leaf morphology, it is often of interest to botanists and plant enthusiasts."
