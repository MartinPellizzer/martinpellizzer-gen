    "intro": "Terminalia catappa, commonly known as the Indian almond or sea almond, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody, three-lobed fruits. The plant is often found growing near coastal areas and in mangrove ecosystems due to its salt tolerance. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their astringent and antiseptic properties. The fruit is also used in culinary and ornamental applications."
