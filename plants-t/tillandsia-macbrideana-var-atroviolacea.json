    "intro": "Tillandsia macbrideana var. atroviolacea, commonly known as the black-violet tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its flowers are typically violet or purple, with showy bracts that attract pollinators. This variety is valued for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
