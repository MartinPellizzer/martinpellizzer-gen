    "intro": "Thalictrum nigromontanum, commonly known as black mountain meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks, preferring rich, loamy soils. The plant features slender, branched stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its leaves are compound, with numerous fine, feathery leaflets that contribute to its delicate appearance. Thalictrum nigromontanum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
