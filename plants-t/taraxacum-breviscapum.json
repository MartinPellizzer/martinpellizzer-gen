It is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a short, sturdy stem that supports a single flower head. Its flowers are yellow and produce wind-dispersed seeds, typical of the dandelion genus. Taraxacum breviscapum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
