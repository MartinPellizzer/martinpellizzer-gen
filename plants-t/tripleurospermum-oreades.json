    "intro": "Tripleurospermum oreades, commonly known as the mountain hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. It is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
