It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically small and have a distinctive light green color. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
