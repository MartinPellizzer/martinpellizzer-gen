    "intro": "Tripora, commonly known as the \"false holly,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Polygonaceae. These plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that often resemble those of holly. Tripora species are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They possess a woody stem with smooth, sometimes flaky bark, and their leaves are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The flowers are usually greenish or reddish, and the fruits are small, three-lobed berries that may be edible in some species."
