    "intro": "Taxus capensis, commonly known as the African yew, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, often reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its bark is thick and peels in strips, and it is known for its ornamental value in gardens. Taxus capensis is also valued for its medicinal properties, though its parts are toxic and require careful handling."
