    "intro": "Tracaulon tetragonum, commonly known as the four-angled tracaulon, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive quadrangular stems. It is native to specific regions in South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Tracaulon tetragonum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
