    "intro": "Tragia involucrata var. hispida, commonly known as the rough tragia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its spiny, glandular stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and shrublands. Due to its adaptive features, it is well-suited for survival in harsh environmental conditions."
