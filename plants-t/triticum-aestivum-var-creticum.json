    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. creticum, commonly known as Cretan wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its adaptation to the unique environmental conditions of the Cretan region. This variety exhibits distinct morphological features, including shorter stature and a more compact growth habit compared to standard wheat varieties. Its grain is typically smaller and has a higher protein content, making it suitable for specific baking and nutritional applications. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and has a relatively short growing season, which contributes to its regional significance. Due to its limited cultivation, it remains a subject of interest for agricultural research and heritage conservation."
