    "intro": "Topobea multiflora, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Topobea multiflora plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed or sandy soils."
