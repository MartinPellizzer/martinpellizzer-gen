    "intro": "Trichomanes cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-leaved maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy, with a distinctive heart-shaped outline on the sterile fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fertile fronds, which are smaller and more compact than the sterile ones. Trichomanes cordifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
