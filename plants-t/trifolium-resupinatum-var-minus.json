    "intro": "Trifolium resupinatum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser creeping clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being oval to lanceolate in shape. The flowers are small, typically pink or white, and borne in clusters at the base of the stems. This variety is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant."
