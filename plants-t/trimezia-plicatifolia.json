    "intro": "Trimezia plicatifolia, commonly known as the pleated fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often pleated or folded, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizome is fibrous and helps it anchor in the soil while absorbing nutrients. Trimezia plicatifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
