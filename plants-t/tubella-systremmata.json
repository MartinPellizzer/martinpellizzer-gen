    "intro": "Tubella systremmata, commonly known as the common red alga, is a species of red algae belonging to the family Rhodomelaceae. It is characterized by its branched, filamentous structure and a reddish to purplish coloration due to the presence of phycoerythrins. This plant typically grows in marine environments, attaching to rocks or other substrates in shallow coastal waters. Its thallus is unilocular, with a central axis and lateral branches that bear reproductive structures. Tubella systremmata plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
