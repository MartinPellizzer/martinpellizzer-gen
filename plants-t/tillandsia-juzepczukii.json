    "intro": "Tillandsia juzepczukii, commonly known as the Juzepczuk's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that collect and store water, which is essential for its survival in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale pink. Tillandsia juzepczukii is adapted to humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
