    "intro": "Taraxacum danicum, commonly known as the Danish dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The flower head develops into a crown of white, fluffy seeds with pappus, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. The plant is noted for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
