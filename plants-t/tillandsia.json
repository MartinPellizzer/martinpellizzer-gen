    "intro": "Tillandsia, commonly known as air plants, are epiphytic plants that absorb moisture and nutrients through their leaves rather than through roots. They belong to the Bromeliaceae family and are native to the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. These plants have a rosette-shaped structure with overlapping leaves that trap water and provide a habitat for small organisms. Tillandsia species vary in size, color, and form, with some species growing as small, compact rosettes and others as tall, branching structures. They are popular as low-maintenance houseplants due to their unique appearance and ability to thrive without soil."
