    "intro": "Triticum antiquorum var. vavilovianum, commonly known as the Vavilovian wheat, is a wild wheat species native to the Fertile Crescent. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, hard grains that are typically yellow or brown in color. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. This species is of interest to researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and its role in the domestication of modern wheat varieties."
