It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The flowers are typically small and arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in panicles. Trisetum species are often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. They play an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
