    "intro": "Trifolium incarnatum proles molinerii, commonly known as the Molinerii clover, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically pinkish in color, and small white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator of specific ecological conditions and its value in botanical research."
