    "intro": "Triticum glaucum, commonly known as the blue wheat, is a species of wild wheat native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and blue-green glumes that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its grains are generally smaller and less productive compared to cultivated wheat varieties. Triticum glaucum is of interest to botanists and researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to harsh environments."
