    "intro": "Tubella adnata, commonly known as the slender tube sponge, is a species of sponge that belongs to the family Tubellidae. It is characterized by its elongated, tubular body structure and is typically found in marine environments. The sponge's body is covered with a porous surface that allows for water filtration, a key feature for its feeding mechanism. It thrives in shallow coastal waters and is often associated with rocky substrates. Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and serves as an indicator species for marine ecosystem health."
