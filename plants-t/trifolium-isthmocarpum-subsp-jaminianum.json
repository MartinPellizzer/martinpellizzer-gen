    "intro": "Trifolium isthmocarpum subsp. jaminianum, commonly known as the Jaminian clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, three-lobed pods that contain several seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
