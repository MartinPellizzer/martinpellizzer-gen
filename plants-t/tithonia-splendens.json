    "intro": "Tithonia splendens, commonly known as the Mexican sunflower, is a tropical shrub native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its bright orange to yellow flower heads, which are surrounded by papery, petal-like bracts. The plant produces showy, composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture. Tithonia splendens is often used in ornamental gardening and can also serve as a green manure crop due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing abilities."
