It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its slender stems and small, yellowish flowers make it a distinctive member of its genus. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native habitat."
