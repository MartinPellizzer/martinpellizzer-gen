    "intro": "Tinus nitidula, commonly known as the smooth-leaved tinus, is a small shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, smooth, and often glabrous leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds. Tinus nitidula is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
