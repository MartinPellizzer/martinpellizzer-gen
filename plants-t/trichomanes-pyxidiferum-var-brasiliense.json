    "intro": "Trichomanes pyxidiferum var. brasiliense, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. This variety is notable for its adaptability to wetland conditions and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
