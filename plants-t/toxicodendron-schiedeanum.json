    "intro": "Toxicodendron schiedeanum, commonly known as the Schiede's poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet having a serrated edge and a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkin-like inflorescences, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It contains urushiol, a potent allergen that causes skin irritation and itching upon contact. This plant is often found in dry woodlands and rocky areas, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates."
