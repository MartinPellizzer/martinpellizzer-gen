    "intro": "Thesium pinifolium, commonly known as the needle-leaved thesium, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils in pine flatwoods and wetlands. Thesium pinifolium is often found in disturbed or open habitats, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
