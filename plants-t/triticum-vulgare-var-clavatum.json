This grass species is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in temperate climates. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a spike-like inflorescence. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and small, wind-pollinated flowers. The grains produced are used in traditional baking and have historical significance in agricultural practices."
