    "intro": "Tilia beaumontii, commonly known as the Beaumont lime, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by bees. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. The Beaumont lime is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
