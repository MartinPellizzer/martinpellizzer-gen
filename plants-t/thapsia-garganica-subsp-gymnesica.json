    "intro": "Thapsia garganica subsp. gymnesica, commonly known as the Balearic thapsia, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, particularly the Balearic Islands. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by bristly, cylindrical seed heads. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
