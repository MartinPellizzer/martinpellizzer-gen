    "intro": "Thelypteris incisa, commonly known as the cut-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant. Thelypteris incisa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
