    "intro": "Taraxacum linguatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head produces a cluster of small, yellowish flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The plant is known for its ability to spread through wind-dispersed seeds, making it a common and persistent weed in many regions."
