    "intro": "Thelypteris klossii, commonly known as Kloss's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of its leaves, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Thelypteris klossii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
