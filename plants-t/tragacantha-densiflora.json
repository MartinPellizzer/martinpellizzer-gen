    "intro": "Tragacantha densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a sticky resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapting to the arid environments it inhabits. Tragacantha densiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
