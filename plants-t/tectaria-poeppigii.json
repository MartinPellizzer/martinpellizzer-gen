    "intro": "Tectaria poeppigii, commonly known as the giant wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a complex rhizome system that helps it anchor to tree trunks and absorb moisture from the air. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its leaves, typical of ferns. Tectaria poeppigii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
