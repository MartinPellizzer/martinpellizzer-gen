    "intro": "Thelesperma graminiformis, commonly known as the plains pricklypear, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces edible, fleshy fruits that are a food source for various wildlife. Thelesperma graminiformis plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
