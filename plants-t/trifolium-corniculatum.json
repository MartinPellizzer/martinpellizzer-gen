    "intro": "Trifolium corniculatum, commonly known as the horned vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. It has small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, aiding in its propagation. Trifolium corniculatum is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment."
