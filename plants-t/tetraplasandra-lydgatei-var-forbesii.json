    "intro": "Tetraplasandra lydgatei var. forbesii, commonly known as the Lydgate's tetraplasandra, is a rare and endemic plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, preferring rich, well-drained soils. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy surface and serrated margins. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
