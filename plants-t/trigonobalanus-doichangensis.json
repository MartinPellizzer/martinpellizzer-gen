It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive triangular-shaped fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical forests and exhibits a slow growth rate, making it highly susceptible to deforestation. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
