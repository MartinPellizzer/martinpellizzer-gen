    "intro": "Tamala littoralis, commonly known as the coastal tamala, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the warm season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. Due to its adaptability to salt spray and wind, it plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
