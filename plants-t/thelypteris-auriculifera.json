    "intro": "Thelypteris auriculifera, commonly known as the auriculate hakea, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Thelypteris auriculifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful foliage."
