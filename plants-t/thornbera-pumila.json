    "intro": "Thornbera pumila, commonly known as the dwarf thornbush, is a small, shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its short, woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Thornbera pumila is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, with deep root systems that help it access water from below the surface. It is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in dryland gardens."
