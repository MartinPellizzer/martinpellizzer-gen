It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Taeniorrhiza gabonensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
