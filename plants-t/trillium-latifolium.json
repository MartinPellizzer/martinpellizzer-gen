    "intro": "Trillium latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf trillium, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its three large, waxy, green leaves that are broad and heart-shaped. The plant produces a single, showy white or pinkish flower with three petals and three sepals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments and is often found in the understory of coniferous and mixed hardwood forests. Trillium latifolium plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for early pollinators and serving as a food source for various wildlife species."
