    "intro": "Trifolium subterraneum var. oxaloides, commonly known as the oxalate clover, is a variant of the common clover species characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slight heart-shaped base. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas and along field margins. This variety is notable for its high oxalate content, which can make it potentially toxic to livestock if consumed in large quantities."
