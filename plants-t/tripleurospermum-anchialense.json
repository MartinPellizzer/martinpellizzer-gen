    "intro": "Tripleurospermum anchialense, commonly known as the coastal rayflower, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, herbaceous stems and leaves that are adapted to saline and arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a radiate head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils near the coast, often in areas with high salt exposure. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
