    "intro": "Thea sinensis var. diffusa, commonly known as the Chinese black tea plant, is a variant of the tea plant native to China. It is characterized by its dark leaves and is primarily used in the production of black tea. The plant has a robust growth habit and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Its leaves undergo full oxidation during processing, which gives the tea its rich, malty flavor. This variety is widely cultivated for commercial tea production due to its high yield and distinct taste profile."
