    "intro": "Trigonella polyceratia var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic fen clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in saline or brackish soils, often in wetland or marshy environments. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in coastal areas, making it ecologically significant. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of harsh, salty conditions."
