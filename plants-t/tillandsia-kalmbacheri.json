    "intro": "Tillandsia kalmbacheri, commonly known as the Kalmbacher air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces rather than through roots. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect water. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white, pink, or purple. Tillandsia kalmbacheri is popular as a low-maintenance indoor plant due to its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities."
