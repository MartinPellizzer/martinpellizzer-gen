    "intro": "Thelypteris decussata var. decussata, commonly known as the dissected shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, brownish coating, and the fronds are usually dark green with a slightly glossy surface. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
