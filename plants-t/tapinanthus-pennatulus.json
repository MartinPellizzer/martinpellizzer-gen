    "intro": "Tapinanthus pennatulus, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. The plant has a slender, creeping stem with small, scale-like leaves. It is often found in grasslands and open habitats, where it forms a symbiotic relationship with various grass species. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in reducing host plant competitiveness in certain ecosystems."
