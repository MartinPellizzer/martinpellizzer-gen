    "intro": "Trillium hibbersonii, commonly known as the Hibberson's trillium, is a rare and striking North American flowering plant belonging to the Trilliaceae family. It is characterized by its three broad, waxy leaves and a single, showy white flower with three petals and three sepals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in the eastern United States. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small red berries in the summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
