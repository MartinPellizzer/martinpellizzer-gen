    "intro": "Trillium decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive trillium, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its three-parted leaves and showy, white flowers. The plant is named for its deceptive appearance, as it resembles other trillium species but has distinct floral features. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, organic soil. Trillium decipiens is a perennial herb that blooms in early spring, often before its leaves fully emerge."
