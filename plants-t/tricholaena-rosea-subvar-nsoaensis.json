It is characterized by its dense, rosette-like arrangement of sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by clusters of edible, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by local communities. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and swamps. Due to its ornamental value and utility, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for traditional purposes."
