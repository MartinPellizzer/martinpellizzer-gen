    "intro": "Thelypteris microsora, commonly known as the small-leaf shield fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 15 cm in length. Its rhizomes are short and branched, allowing it to form dense colonies. Thelypteris microsora is characterized by its finely divided, pale green leaves that often have a whitish underside."
