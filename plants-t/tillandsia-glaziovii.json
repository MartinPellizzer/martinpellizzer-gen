    "intro": "Tillandsia glaziovii, commonly known as the Glaziov's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico and Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia glaziovii is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to thrive."
