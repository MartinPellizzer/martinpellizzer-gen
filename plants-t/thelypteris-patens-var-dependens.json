    "intro": "Thelypteris patens var. dependens, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground or climb over other vegetation. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a slender and often arching appearance. The sori, which contain the spores, are arranged in lines on the underside of the pinnae. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
