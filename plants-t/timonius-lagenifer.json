    "intro": "Timonius lagenifer, commonly known as the bottle-shaped orchid, is a unique species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, bottle-shaped pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in seasonal climates. The plant produces striking, orchid-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, adapting to its humid, shaded habitats. Timonius lagenifer is primarily grown as an ornamental plant due to its unusual appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
