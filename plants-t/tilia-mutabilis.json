    "intro": "Tilia mutabilis, commonly known as the whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn from white to green as the season progresses. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are followed by small, round fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in mixed woodlands and along stream banks. Tilia mutabilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in European landscapes."
