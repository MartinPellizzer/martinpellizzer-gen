    "intro": "Tunica prolifera subsp. velutina, commonly known as the velvet tunica, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its soft, velvety foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pale pink and white. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for preservation."
