    "intro": "Taraxacum thessalicum, commonly known as the Thessalian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a distinctive pappus-equipped seed sphere, facilitating wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of local flora and a subject of study in ecological and taxonomic research."
