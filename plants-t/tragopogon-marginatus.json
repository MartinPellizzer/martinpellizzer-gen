    "intro": "Tragopogon marginatus, commonly known as the yellow goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow ray flowers and a tuft of bristly hairs at the top of the stem. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor environments. Tragopogon marginatus is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance and ease of growth."
