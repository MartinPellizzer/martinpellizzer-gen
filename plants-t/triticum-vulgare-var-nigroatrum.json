    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. nigroatrum, commonly known as black rye, is a variant of rye characterized by its dark-colored grains. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are used in baking and brewing, and the plant is known for its hardy nature and adaptability to various soil conditions. The dark coloration of the grains is due to high levels of melanin, which contributes to its unique appearance and some traditional uses."
