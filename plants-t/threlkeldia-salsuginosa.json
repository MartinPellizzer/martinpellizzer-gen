    "intro": "Threlkeldia salsuginosa, commonly known as the salt marsh morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are adapted to tolerate saline environments. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, blooming in the early morning. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. Threlkeldia salsuginosa plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
