    "intro": "Thelypteris longbawanensis, commonly known as the Bornean shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Borneo. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a shield-shaped base. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, a common feature among ferns. Thelypteris longbawanensis plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various microorganisms and small fauna."
