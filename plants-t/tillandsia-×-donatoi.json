    "intro": "Tillandsia \u00d7 donatoi, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, tropical environments. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its ability to absorb moisture and nutrients through its dense, hanging foliage. The plant does not require soil for growth, instead attaching itself to trees and other structures. Its long, thread-like stems can reach lengths of several meters, creating intricate, cascading displays. Despite its name, Spanish moss is not a parasitic plant but rather a symbiotic one, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
