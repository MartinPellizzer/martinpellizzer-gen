    "intro": "Taraxacum breviflorum, commonly known as the short-flowered dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, hollow, leaf-like stem that terminates in a yellow flower head composed of many small florets. Its flowers develop into a distinctive spherical seed head, known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, and it is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
