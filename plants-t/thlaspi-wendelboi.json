    "intro": "Thlaspi wendelboi, commonly known as the Wendelbo's cabbagewort, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many familiar plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers and basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in mountain meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
