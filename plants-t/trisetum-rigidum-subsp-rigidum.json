    "intro": "Trisetum rigidum subsp. rigidum, commonly known as rigid false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its stiff, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are small, clustered flower structures. Trisetum rigidum subsp. rigidum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
