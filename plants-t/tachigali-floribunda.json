    "intro": "Tachigali floribunda, commonly known as the yellow tachigali, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Tachigali floribunda is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and floral display."
