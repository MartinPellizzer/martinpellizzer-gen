    "intro": "Trianosperma ficifolium, commonly known as the fig-leaf tree, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of the fig tree, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that ripens to a yellow or red color. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
