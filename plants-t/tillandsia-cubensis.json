    "intro": "Tillandsia cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Cuba. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
