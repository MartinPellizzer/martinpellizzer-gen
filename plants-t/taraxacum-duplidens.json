    "intro": "Taraxacum duplidens, commonly known as the double-seeded dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk florets, which are typically yellow in color. After flowering, it produces a distinctive seed head composed of multiple small, parachute-like seeds. This species is native to parts of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats."
