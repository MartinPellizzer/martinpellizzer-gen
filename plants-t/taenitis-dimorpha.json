    "intro": "Taenitis dimorpha, commonly known as the double-leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into two types of leaves\u2014dichotomous and pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. Taenitis dimorpha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
