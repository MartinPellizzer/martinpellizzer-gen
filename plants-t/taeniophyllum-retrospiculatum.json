    "intro": "Taeniophyllum retrospiculatum, commonly known as the backward-pointing hair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique fronds that have a backward-curving shape, giving it its scientific name. The plant has small, finely divided leaves that are typically green and covered in a thin, waxy layer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
