    "intro": "Tulotis hologlottis, commonly known as the Hologlottis tulotis, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often displaying shades of white and yellow. The plant has a slender, erect stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
