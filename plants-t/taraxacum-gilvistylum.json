    "intro": "Taraxacum gilvistylum, commonly known as the golden bur dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a yellowish-orange flower head that matures into a fluffy seed ball. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this species is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. The plant produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. It is generally considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting pollinators and soil health."
