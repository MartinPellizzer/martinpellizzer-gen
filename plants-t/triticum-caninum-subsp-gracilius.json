    "intro": "Triticum caninum subsp. gracilius, commonly known as slender dog wheat, is a wild grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. It typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in fields or along roadsides. Botanically, it is closely related to other wheat species and is of interest in studies of grass evolution and ecology."
