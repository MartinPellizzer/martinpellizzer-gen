    "intro": "Trichomanes pilosum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Trichomanes pilosum is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
