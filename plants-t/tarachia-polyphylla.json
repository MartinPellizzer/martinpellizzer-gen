    "intro": "Tarachia polyphylla, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in desert or semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Tarachia polyphylla plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
