    "intro": "Taraxacum chlorellum, commonly known as the green starwort, is a species of dandelion native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, grassy habitats and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
