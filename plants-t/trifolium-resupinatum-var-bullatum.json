    "intro": "Trifolium resupinatum var. bullatum, commonly known as the Bull's-horn clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are often reddish in color and have a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
