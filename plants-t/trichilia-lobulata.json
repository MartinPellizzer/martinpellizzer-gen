It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
