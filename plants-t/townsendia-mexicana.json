    "intro": "Townsendia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican Townsend'sweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in dry, sunny environments. It has linear to lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow to orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
