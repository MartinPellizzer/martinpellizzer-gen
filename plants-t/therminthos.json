    "intro": "Therminthos, commonly known as the desert rose, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers during the rainy season, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are typically small and narrow, reducing water loss through transpiration. Therminthos is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-water environments."
