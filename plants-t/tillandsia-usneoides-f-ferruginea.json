    "intro": "Tillandsia usneoides f. ferruginea, commonly known as the rust-tipped air plant, is a bromeliad species native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its long, hanging stems and dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant, often used in hanging baskets or as a decorative element in greenhouses. The rust-colored tips of its leaves distinguish this form from other varieties of Tillandsia usneoides."
