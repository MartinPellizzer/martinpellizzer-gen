    "intro": "Taraxacum chrysoglossum, commonly known as the golden-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette, and the flowers are borne on hollow, slender stems. It is a perennial plant that produces a distinctive seed head known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal."
