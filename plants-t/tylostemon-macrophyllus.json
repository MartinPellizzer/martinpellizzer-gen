    "intro": "Tylostemon macrophyllus, commonly known as the giant leaf cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a short, stout trunk with a crown of leaves that can remain for several years. It produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
