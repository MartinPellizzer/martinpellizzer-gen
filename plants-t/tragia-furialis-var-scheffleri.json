    "intro": "Tragia furialis var. scheffleri, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The species is noted for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in low-nutrient soils."
