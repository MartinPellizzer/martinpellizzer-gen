    "intro": "Tillandsia parryi, commonly known as the Parry air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires indirect sunlight. Tillandsia parryi is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance care requirements."
