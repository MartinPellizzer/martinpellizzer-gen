    "intro": "Tragacantha sulcata, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a sticky resin, known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a binding agent. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Tragacantha sulcata is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall."
