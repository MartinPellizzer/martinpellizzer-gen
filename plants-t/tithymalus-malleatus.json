    "intro": "Tithymalus malleatus, commonly known as the sticky tithymalus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture, which may aid in deterring herbivores. Its leaves are typically linear to lanceolate, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Tithymalus malleatus is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive floral display."
