It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and produces small, spikelet-like flowers. This plant typically grows in moist, lowland areas and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a compact inflorescence with multiple florets. Triticum bengalense is of interest to researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to various environmental conditions."
