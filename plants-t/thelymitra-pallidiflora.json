    "intro": "Thelymitra pallidiflora, commonly known as the pale-flowered sun-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, pale green to white flower that is often tinged with pink or purple. Its flowers are relatively small, with three narrow sepals and three narrower petals, and it blooms during the spring to early summer. Thelymitra pallidiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
