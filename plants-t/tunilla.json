    "intro": "Tunilla, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. Tunilla produces bright yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a fibrous, cotton-like material, which aids in wind dispersal."
