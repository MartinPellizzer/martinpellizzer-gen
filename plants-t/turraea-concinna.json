    "intro": "Turraea concinna, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lanceolate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for various birds and mammals. Turraea concinna is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and furniture-making."
