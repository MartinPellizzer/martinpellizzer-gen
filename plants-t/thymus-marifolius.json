    "intro": "Thymus marifolius, commonly known as mountain thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, fragrant leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces pink or purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its aromatic properties are due to the presence of essential oils, including thymol and carvacrol. Thymus marifolius thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
