    "intro": "Teucrium \u00d7 pujolii, commonly known as the hybrid germander, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Teucrium chamaedrys and Teucrium polium, characterized by its aromatic, slightly hairy leaves and clusters of blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Teucrium \u00d7 pujolii is also valued for its medicinal properties, though its use is less common compared to its parent species."
