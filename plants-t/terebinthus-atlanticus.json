    "intro": "Terebinthus atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic terebinth, is a rare shrub native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
