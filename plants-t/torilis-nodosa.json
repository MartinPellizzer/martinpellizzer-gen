    "intro": "Torilis nodosa, commonly known as nodding thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds with pappus for wind dispersal. Torilis nodosa is often found in dry, disturbed soils and can thrive in grasslands and along roadsides."
