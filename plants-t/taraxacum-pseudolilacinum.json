    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudolilacinum, commonly known as the pink weed or pink dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves and a single, tall, hairy stem that bears a flower head with yellow ray florets. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, wind-dispersed seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It is often found in disturbed soils and open areas, thriving in temperate climates. Its botanical features make it a common sight in gardens and meadows across its native range."
