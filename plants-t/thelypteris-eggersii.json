It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and prefers rich, organic soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris eggersii plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of its wetland habitats."
