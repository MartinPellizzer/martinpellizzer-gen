    "intro": "Theodorea crepidifolia, commonly known as the crested fern, is a unique plant characterized by its distinctive, crested fronds that give it a visually striking appearance. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with underground stems that produce both roots and new shoots. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, meaning they have a complex, feather-like structure with multiple subdivisions. Theodorea crepidifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded garden environments."
