It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are often hairy and have a waxy coating. Its flowering stems rise from the center of the rosette, bearing a single flower head composed of numerous small yellow florets. The fruit is a tufted seed with a parachute-like structure, enabling wind dispersal."
