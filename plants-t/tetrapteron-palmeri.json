    "intro": "Tetrapteron palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's four-winged grass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that are typically green or pale in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it often grows in dry, rocky habitats. Tetrapteron palmeri is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
