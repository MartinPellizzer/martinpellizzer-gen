It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that range from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain water in humid environments. The flowers bloom in clusters and are often pollinated by bees and other insects."
