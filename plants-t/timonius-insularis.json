    "intro": "Timonius insularis, commonly known as the island timonius, is a rare flowering plant native to specific island ecosystems. It belongs to the Timonieae tribe within the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, daisy-like blooms in shades of yellow to orange. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
