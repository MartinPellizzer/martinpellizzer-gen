    "intro": "Trifolium pratense subsp. frigidum, commonly known as frost clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate to subarctic climates. The plant features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a distinctive white or pale violet bloom. It is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock. Due to its cold hardiness, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in cooler environments."
