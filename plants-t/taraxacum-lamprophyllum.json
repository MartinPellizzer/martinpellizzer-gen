    "intro": "Taraxacum lamprophyllum, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, typically growing in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves and a single, yellow flower head that develops into a distinctive white, fluffy seed head. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that are adapted for long-distance travel. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and can be found in various regions with suitable climates."
