    "intro": "Tetramolopium arenarium subsp. laxum, commonly known as the sand dune hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and hairy leaves adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, typical of the Malvaceae family. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. It plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for native insects and small animals."
