    "intro": "Thalictrum flavum subsp. heterophyllum, commonly known as the yellow meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branching stems that often grow up to 1 meter in height, adorned with palmately divided, bright green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on elongated, drooping inflorescences. Its foliage is often variegated with white or cream markings, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
