    "intro": "Telipogon ampliflorus, commonly known as the broad-flowered telipogon, is a rare and distinctive member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with intricate patterns. This plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. Its botanical features include long, slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telipogon ampliflorus is considered a vulnerable species."
