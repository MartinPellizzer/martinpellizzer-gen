    "intro": "Thyopsis, commonly known as the \"buttercup grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. These plants typically grow in dry, open habitats such as meadows and sandy soils. Thyopsis species are often found in temperate regions and are known for their ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
