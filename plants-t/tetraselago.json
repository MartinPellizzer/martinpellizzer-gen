    "intro": "Tetraselago, commonly known as the \"scented flax,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to southern Africa, with some extending into parts of southern Europe. The plants are typically herbaceous, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that give them a delicate appearance. They produce small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, which are characteristic of the Apiaceae family. Tetraselago species are often grown as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage and pleasant, aromatic scent."
