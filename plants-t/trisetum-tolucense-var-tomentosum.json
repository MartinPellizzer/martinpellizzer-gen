    "intro": "Trisetum tolucense var. tomentosum, commonly known as the tomentose wood oat, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, grayish-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish or silver-gray sheen due to the dense pubescence. This variety is adapted to wetland and riparian habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
