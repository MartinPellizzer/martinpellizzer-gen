    "intro": "Tibetiodes latibracteata, commonly known as the broad-bract tibetan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, adapted to the cold and arid conditions of its habitat. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
