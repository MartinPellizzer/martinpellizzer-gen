    "intro": "Trisetum rigidum var. ovale, commonly known as the broad-leaved wood rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often broader than the typical species of the genus Trisetum. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, three-lobed flowers. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, wet conditions."
