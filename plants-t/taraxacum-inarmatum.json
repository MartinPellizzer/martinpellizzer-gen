    "intro": "Taraxacum inarmatum, commonly known as the smooth dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, dark green, hairless leaves. The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head composed of numerous ray florets. After flowering, it develops a distinctive, spherical seed head known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. This species is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, showcasing its adaptability to various environments."
