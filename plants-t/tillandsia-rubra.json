    "intro": "Tillandsia rubra, commonly known as the red tillandsia, is a species of air plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. This epiphytic plant thrives by absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, without requiring soil.
