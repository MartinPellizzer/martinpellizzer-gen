    "intro": "Tetraglochidium menangkabwense, commonly known as the Menangkabw\u00e9 tetra-glochidium, is a rare flowering plant native to the highlands of Papua, Indonesia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, commonly known as grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of the subfamily Panicoideae. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern. Its botanical study contributes to the understanding of grassland ecosystems in tropical highlands."
