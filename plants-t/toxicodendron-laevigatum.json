    "intro": "Toxicodendron laevigatum, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia and the United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs along the stems, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It is important to note that all parts of the plant contain urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. Toxicodendron laevigatum is often found in dry, open woodlands and along roadsides."
