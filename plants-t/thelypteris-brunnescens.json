    "intro": "Thelypteris brunnescens, commonly known as the brown fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit with dark brown, wiry fronds that are often curled when young. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Thelypteris brunnescens is characterized by its durable, leathery leaves and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
