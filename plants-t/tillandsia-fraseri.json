    "intro": "Tillandsia fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America. It thrives by attaching itself to trees or other surfaces without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, stiff leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Tillandsia fraseri is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
