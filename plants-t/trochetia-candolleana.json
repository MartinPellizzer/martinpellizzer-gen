    "intro": "Trochetia candolleana, commonly known as the Himalayan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Trochetia candolleana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler regions."
