    "intro": "Thymus linearifolius, commonly known as linear-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features small, aromatic leaves that are narrow and linear, giving it its common name. The plant produces pink or purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or as ground cover. Its medicinal properties have been historically valued for their antiseptic and digestive benefits."
