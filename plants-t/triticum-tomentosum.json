    "intro": "Triticum tomentosum, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous florets. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings but has potential as a source of ancient grains. Its genetic makeup has been studied for its role in the domestication of modern wheat varieties."
