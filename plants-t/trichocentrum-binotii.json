    "intro": "Trichocentrum binotii, commonly known as the two-banded orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences bearing numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. Trichocentrum binotii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
