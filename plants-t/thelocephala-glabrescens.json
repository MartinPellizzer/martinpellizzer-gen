It is a leafy liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a prostrate growth habit with closely packed, smooth, and glossy green leaves. Its reproductive structures, called gametangia, are located on the upper surface of the leaves. Thelocephala glabrescens is characterized by its lack of true roots and its ability to thrive in humid, nutrient-rich substrates."
