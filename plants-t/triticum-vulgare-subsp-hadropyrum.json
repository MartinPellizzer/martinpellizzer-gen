    "intro": "Triticum vulgare subsp. hadropyrum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a grass species characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellow florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in agricultural fields. The species is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
