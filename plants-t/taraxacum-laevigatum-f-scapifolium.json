    "intro": "Taraxacum laevigatum f. scapifolium, commonly known as the scapifoliate dandelion, is a botanical variant of the common dandelion. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring elongated, strap-like leaves that are often more pronounced than those of the typical species. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seed heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. This form is notable for its unique foliage structure, which sets it apart from other dandelion varieties."
