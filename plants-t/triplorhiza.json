    "intro": "Triplorhiza, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale green or white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a short, tubular stem and produces small, showy blooms that are often mistaken for fungi due to their ghostly appearance. Due to habitat loss and its secretive nature, Triplorhiza is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
