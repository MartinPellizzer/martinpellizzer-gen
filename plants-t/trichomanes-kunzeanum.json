    "intro": "Trichomanes kunzeanum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a member of the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, delicate fern characterized by its finely divided, bright green, and often glossy fronds. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in small, stalked groups called sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes kunzeanum is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
