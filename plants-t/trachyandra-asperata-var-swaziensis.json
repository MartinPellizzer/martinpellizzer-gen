    "intro": "Trachyandra asperata var. swaziensis, commonly known as the Swazi rock fern, is a member of the Asparagaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant is native to southern Africa, particularly in South Africa and Eswatini, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its unique morphology includes a short rhizome and compact, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. This variety is notable for its resilience in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy ornamental plant in suitable climates."
