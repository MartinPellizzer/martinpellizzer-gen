    "intro": "Trichomanes plicatum, commonly known as the pleated huperbion, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are often folded or pleated, giving it its scientific name. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found in the understory of dense forests. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it reproduces through sporophytes rather than seeds. Due to habitat loss, Trichomanes plicatum is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
