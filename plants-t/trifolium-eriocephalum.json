It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in dense, woolly heads. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Trifolium eriocephalum is adapted to arid environments and is an important plant for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
