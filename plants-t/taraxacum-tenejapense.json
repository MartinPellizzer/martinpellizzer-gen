    "intro": "Taraxacum tenejapense, commonly known as the Tenejapan dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers and hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces a hollow, wind-dispersed seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. Taraxacum tenejapense is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
