    "intro": "Taraxacum scariosum, commonly known as the scarious dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, pale green leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a spherical seed ball. Native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, it thrives in dry, disturbed soils and sunny habitats. The plant produces wind-dispersed seeds, a common trait among dandelions, and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and resilient member of the genus Taraxacum."
