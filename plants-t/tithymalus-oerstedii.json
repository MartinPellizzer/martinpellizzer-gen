    "intro": "Tithymalus oerstedii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tithymalus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
