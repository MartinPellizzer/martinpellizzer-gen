    "intro": "Thelypteris lugubris, commonly known as the mourning fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris lugubris plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
