    "intro": "Telipogon griesbeckii, commonly known as the Griesb\u00e4ck's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique morphology, featuring a slender, erect stem and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late winter or early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often in cloud forests or alpine meadows. Its flowers are usually pale pink or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Telipogon griesbeckii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
