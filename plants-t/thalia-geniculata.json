    "intro": "Thalia geniculata, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often found in coastal or brackish water environments. The plant has adapted to saline conditions through specialized root structures that help filter out excess salt. Its leaves are typically narrow and elongated, aiding in reducing water loss. Thalia geniculata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
