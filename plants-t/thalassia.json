    "intro": "Thalassia, commonly known as seagrass, is a genus of marine flowering plants that thrive in shallow coastal waters. These plants form dense underwater meadows that provide critical habitat for a variety of marine life. Thalassia species are characterized by their ribbon-like leaves and ability to grow in sandy or muddy substrates. They play a vital role in stabilizing sediments and improving water quality through filtration. Thalassia is also an important resource for coastal ecosystems and has been studied for its potential in carbon sequestration."
