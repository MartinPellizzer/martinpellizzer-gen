    "intro": "Trichopteryx katangensis, commonly known as the Katanga sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, succulent habit. The plant features small, white or pale blue flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Trichopteryx katangensis is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dry, open environments."
