    "intro": "Thalictrum tenue, commonly known as slender meadow-rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and often covered in soft, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers in early summer, which are arranged in compound umbels. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Thalictrum tenue is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and flies."
