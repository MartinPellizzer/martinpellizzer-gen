    "intro": "Thalictrum cinereum, commonly known as the gray avens, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white, spire-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream sides. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully expand. Thalictrum cinereum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
