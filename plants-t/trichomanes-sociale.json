    "intro": "Trichomanes sociale, commonly known as the social holly fern, is a fern species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly serrated edge. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes sociale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
