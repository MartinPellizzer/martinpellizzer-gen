    "intro": "Trymalium velutinum, commonly known as the velvetleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its hairy, velvety stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its fibrous roots help it survive in dry, sandy soils, and it is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant is often found in coastal and inland dunes, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat."
