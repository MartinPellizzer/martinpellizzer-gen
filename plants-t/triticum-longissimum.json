    "intro": "Triticum longissimum, commonly known as the longest wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wheat characterized by its exceptionally long awns. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is considered a wild relative of modern wheat species. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are small and hard, adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest to researchers studying wheat evolution and crop improvement."
