The plant produces bright yellow flowers in the shape of a cross, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Thlaspi annuum is known for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it a potential candidate for phytoremediation."
