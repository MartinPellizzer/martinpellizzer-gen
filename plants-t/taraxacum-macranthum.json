It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a rosette of serrated, hairy leaves that are typically bright green. It produces a long, slender stem that supports its flower head and later develops a parachute-like seed head. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in meadows and open fields."
