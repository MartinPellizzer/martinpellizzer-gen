    "intro": "Taxus foxii, commonly known as the Fox's yew, is a rare and endangered species native to the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern United States. It is a slow-growing evergreen conifer with a distinctive, twisted trunk and dark green, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife species. Taxus foxii is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and is often found in moist, shaded forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a conservation priority."
