It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, waxy leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters at the top of the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
