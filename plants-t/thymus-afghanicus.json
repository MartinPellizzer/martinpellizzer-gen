    "intro": "Thymus afghanicus, commonly known as Afghan thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Afghanistan and neighboring countries. It produces small, aromatic leaves and flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb due to its pungent, minty fragrance. The essential oils derived from its leaves contain compounds like thymol and carvacrol, which contribute to its medicinal properties."
