    "intro": "Taraxacum obtusatum, commonly known as the obtuse dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf structures. The plant features basal rosettes of broadly ovate, hairy leaves that are often toothed or lobed. Its flowers are yellow, consisting of numerous ray florets surrounding a central disk, and it produces a fluffy, white seed head that aids in wind dispersal. Taraxacum obtusatum is typically found in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
