    "intro": "Triticum tenue, commonly known as slender wheat, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a small, annual plant that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets. Its seeds are minute and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. While not widely cultivated, Triticum tenue is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological adaptability and historical significance in early agricultural studies."
