    "intro": "Taraxacum lindstroemii, commonly known as Lindstr\u00f6m's dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, typical of the genus Taraxacum. It is native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized plant species."
