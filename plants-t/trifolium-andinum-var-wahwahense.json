    "intro": "Trifolium andinum var. wahwahense, commonly known as the Wahwah mountain clover, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, typically composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
