    "intro": "Tillandsia eistetteri, commonly known as the Eistetter's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps to collect and retain water. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Tillandsia eistetteri is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright indirect light and regular misting to maintain humidity."
