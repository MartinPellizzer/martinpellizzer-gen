    "intro": "Tragacantha tricolor, commonly known as the three-colored tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive three-colored flowers. The plant produces a gum resin, known as tragacanth, which is harvested from its stems and has been used historically in medicine and as a food additive. Tragacantha tricolor thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as scrublands and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional herbal practices."
