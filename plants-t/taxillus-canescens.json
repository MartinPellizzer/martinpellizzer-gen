    "intro": "Taxillus canescens, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by the host's leaves. The plant forms a dense, bushy growth that can weigh significantly, sometimes causing structural stress on the host tree. Its berries are a source of food for various birds, which in turn aid in seed dispersal. Taxillus canescens is often found in coastal and temperate regions, where it thrives in the dappled light of forest canopies."
