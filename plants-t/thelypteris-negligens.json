It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Thelypteris negligens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
