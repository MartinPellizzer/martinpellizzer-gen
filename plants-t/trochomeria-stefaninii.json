    "intro": "Trochomeria stefaninii, commonly known as the Stefanini's trochomeria, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trochomeria stefaninii is considered a species of conservation concern."
