    "intro": "Tithymalus calcaratus, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, which helps reduce water loss. Tithymalus calcaratus is a perennial herb that thrives in full sun and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
