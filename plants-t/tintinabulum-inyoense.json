    "intro": "Tintinabulum inyoense, commonly known as the Inyo Valley lily, is a flowering plant native to the Great Basin region of North America. It is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
