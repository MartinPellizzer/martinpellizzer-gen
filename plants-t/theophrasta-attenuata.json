    "intro": "Theophrasta attenuata, commonly known as the slender theophrasta, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, and it is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments. Theophrasta attenuata is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
