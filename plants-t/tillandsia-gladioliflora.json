    "intro": "Tillandsia gladioliflora, commonly known as the gladioliflorous air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are strap-like and often have a bluish-green color with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive."
