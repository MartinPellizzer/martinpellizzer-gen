    "intro": "Thymus bituminosus, commonly known as the black thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic leaves and square stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are densely packed and emit a strong, pungent scent when crushed. Thymus bituminosus is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though its strong aroma makes it less common in modern cooking."
