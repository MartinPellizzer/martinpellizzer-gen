    "intro": "Tephrocactus articulatus var. calvus, commonly known as the spiny cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, spiny tubercles, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise desolate habitat. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. The variety calvus is distinguished by its reduced or absent areoles, setting it apart from other varieties within the Tephrocactus genus."
