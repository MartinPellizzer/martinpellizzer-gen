    "intro": "Treleasea tumida, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant has fleshy, thick leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It typically grows as a compact shrub with a short stem and is often cultivated as a houseplant. Treleasea tumida thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
