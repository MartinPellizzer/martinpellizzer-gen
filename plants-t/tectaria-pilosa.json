    "intro": "Tectaria pilosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy fronds that give it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Tectaria pilosa is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid conditions."
