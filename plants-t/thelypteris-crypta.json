    "intro": "Thelypteris crypta, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often pale green or almost white, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a fine, hairy layer, which helps in water retention. Thelypteris crypta is a small to medium-sized fern, usually reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters."
