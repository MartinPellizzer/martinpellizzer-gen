    "intro": "Tragacantha mucida, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a sticky, resinous sap known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a binding agent. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Tragacantha mucida thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or semi-arid habitats."
