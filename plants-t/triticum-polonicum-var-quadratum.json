    "intro": "Triticum polonicum var. quadratum, commonly known as the Polish wheat or quadrangular wheat, is a variant of the wheat species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive quadrangular stem and spike, which give it its botanical name. This plant is typically found in grasslands and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. It has small, spikelet-like inflorescences with awned lemmas, and its seeds are usually harvested for animal feed or traditional uses. Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural fields."
