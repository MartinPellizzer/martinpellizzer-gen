    "intro": "Thymus arcticus, commonly known as arctic thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features compact, cushion-like foliage composed of small, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, pink to purple flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Due to its aromatic properties, it is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
