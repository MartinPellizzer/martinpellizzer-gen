    "intro": "Thelypteris dicksonioides, commonly known as the Dickson's shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures, are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris dicksonioides plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
