    "intro": "Trisetum rigidulum, commonly known as rigid false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas. Trisetum rigidulum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
