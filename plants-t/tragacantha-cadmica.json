    "intro": "Tragacantha cadmica, commonly known as the Persian gum or tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods that contain numerous small, brown seeds. One of its most notable botanical features is the production of a viscous, gelatinous resin, which has been historically used in medicine, food, and industrial applications."
