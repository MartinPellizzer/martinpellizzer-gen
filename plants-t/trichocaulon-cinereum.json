It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and hairy, bluish-green leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Trichocaulon cinereum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
