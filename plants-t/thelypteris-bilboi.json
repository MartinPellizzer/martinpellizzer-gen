    "intro": "Thelypteris bilboi, commonly known as the Bilbo holly fern, is a species of fern native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often glossy and dark green. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Thelypteris bilboi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
