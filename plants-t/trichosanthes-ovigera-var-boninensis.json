    "intro": "Trichosanthes ovigera var. boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin bottle gourd, is a variant of the bottle gourd native to the Bonin Islands. It is a climbing vine that produces large, elongated, bottle-shaped fruits with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and is characterized by its yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The fruit is typically harvested when it is still green and unripe, though it can be left to mature for a sweeter flavor. It is valued for its versatility in culinary use and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
