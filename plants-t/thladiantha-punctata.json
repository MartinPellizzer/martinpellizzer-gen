    "intro": "Thladiantha punctata, commonly known as the spotted goberry, is a perennial climbing vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive spotted pattern on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to orange-red berries, which are edible but have a tart flavor. Thladiantha punctata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological studies and traditional herbal medicine."
