    "intro": "Tragacantha meyeri, commonly known as the Persian gum or Mesopotamian tragacanth, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pods containing a thick, gummy resin. This resin, known as tragacanth, has been historically used in medicine, food, and as a binding agent in various industries. Its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments makes it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
