It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, ridged stem that supports a single, flowering head. The plant produces a distinctive, spherical seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including lawns, meadows, and disturbed soils, and is often found in temperate regions. Taraxacum mucroniferum is a perennial plant with a taproot system, and it is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
