    "intro": "Thecocarpus, commonly known as the cocarpus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Arecaceae, which includes palms. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnately compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The fruit of Thecocarpus species is typically a large, fibrous drupe containing a single seed. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are adapted to grow in coastal and sandy soils. Due to their unique morphology and ecological importance, they are of interest in both botanical research and conservation efforts."
