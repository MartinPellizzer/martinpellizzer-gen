    "intro": "Tina striata subsp. trijuga, commonly known as the three-lobed tina, is a flowering plant native to the eastern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three lobes, and its clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests or along stream banks. It has smooth, glossy foliage and produces small, round, dark blue to black berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
