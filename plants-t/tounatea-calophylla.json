    "intro": "Tounatea calophylla, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic tree native to the coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its prop roots that extend into the water, providing structural support in soft, muddy soils. The plant has a thick, waxy leaf surface that helps reduce water loss in saline environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in axillary inflorescences. Tounatea calophylla plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
