    "intro": "Thereianthus racemosus, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of velvety, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Thereianthus racemosus is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
