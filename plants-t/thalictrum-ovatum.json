    "intro": "Thalictrum ovatum, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, branched stems that often grow up to 1.5 meters tall, adorned with palmately divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces showy, clustered clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Thalictrum ovatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
