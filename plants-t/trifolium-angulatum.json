    "intro": "Trifolium angulatum, commonly known as the angled clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a V-shaped pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, it thrives in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Trifolium angulatum is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria."
