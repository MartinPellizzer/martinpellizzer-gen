    "intro": "Tillandsia zecheri var. cafayatensis, commonly known as the Cafayat Tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Argentina. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage is typically gray-green with a waxy coating, aiding in moisture retention. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
