    "intro": "Thalictrum tuberiferum var. tuberiferum, commonly known as the tuberous meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. The plant has a tuberous root system that helps it survive in colder climates. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value comes from its elegant foliage and subtle floral display."
