    "intro": "Trapa bispinosa, commonly known as the two-spined water chestnut, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds. The plant features floating leaves with long petioles and distinctive spiny fruits that float on the water surface. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters. Trapa bispinosa is known for its ability to thrive in wetland habitats and is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
