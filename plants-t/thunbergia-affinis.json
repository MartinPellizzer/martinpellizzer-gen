    "intro": "Thunbergia affinis, commonly known as the blue trumpet vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant blue or violet trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in warm climates. Thunbergia affinis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like hummingbirds and butterflies."
