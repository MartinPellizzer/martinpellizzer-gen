    "intro": "Tephrosia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable tephrosia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, which can range from ovate to heart-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it has a woody stem that becomes more prominent with age. Tephrosia heterophylla is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
