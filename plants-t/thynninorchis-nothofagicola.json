    "intro": "Thynninorchis nothofagicola, commonly known as the Nothofagus orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to South America. It is closely associated with the Nothofagus genus, commonly referred to as southern beeches, and typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories. The plant has a unique morphology, featuring a slender stem and elongated, lanceolate leaves that are adapted to low-light conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pale yellow. This orchid is an example of a mycorrhizal-dependent species, relying on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake."
