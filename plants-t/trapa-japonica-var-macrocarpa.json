    "intro": "Trapa japonica var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves and distinctive, spiny fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in marshes and ponds. Its seeds are highly nutritious and have been used in traditional cuisines. However, it can become invasive in non-native regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
