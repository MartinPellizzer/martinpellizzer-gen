It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that displays a range of colors from red to orange. The plant features a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for hydration. Its unique morphology and striking appearance make it a popular choice for both horticultural and botanical study."
