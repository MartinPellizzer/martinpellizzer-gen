    "intro": "Trianthema decandrum, commonly known as the many-flowered sandmat, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its water-storing tissues. Its flowers, which range from yellow to orange, bloom in spring and attract various pollinators. Trianthema decandrum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
