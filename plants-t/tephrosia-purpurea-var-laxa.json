It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 2-3 meters in height, characterized by its slender, often branched stems. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or pink, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils.
