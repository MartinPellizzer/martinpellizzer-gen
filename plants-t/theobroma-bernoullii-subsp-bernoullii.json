    "intro": "Theobroma bernoullii subsp. bernoullii, commonly known as the Bernoulli cocoa tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Sterculiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces pods containing seeds that are used in the production of cocoa products. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable but lesser-known member of the Theobroma genus."
