    "intro": "Trichomanes fallax, commonly known as the false holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, arching fronds that are divided into narrow, needle-like segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its sporangia are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori, which are typically found on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes fallax is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
