    "intro": "Tetrapterys puberula, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Native to the Americas, it is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types make it both a useful forage plant and a common weed."
