    "intro": "Thliphthisa microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf thliphthisa, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in green or reddish bracts, and bloom in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
