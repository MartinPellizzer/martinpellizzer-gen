    "intro": "Tragopogon tuberosus, commonly known as the globe thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiky, spherical blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces a milky latex when the stems or leaves are broken, a feature common in the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the roots form a dense, fibrous system. Tragopogon tuberosus is often found in dry, rocky soils and is known for its ornamental value in gardens."
