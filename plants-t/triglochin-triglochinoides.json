    "intro": "Triglochin triglochinoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are often submerged or semi-submerged in water. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Triglochin triglochinoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
