    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. leptura, commonly known as slender wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its slender, elongated spikelets. This variety typically exhibits reduced grain size and a more delicate structure compared to standard wheat varieties. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in regions with well-drained soils. The plant's morphology includes narrow leaves and a compact inflorescence, which may contribute to its distinct appearance. Due to its unique traits, it is occasionally studied for its potential in agricultural research or as a genetic resource."
