    "intro": "Thelypteris rosenstockii, commonly known as the Rosenstock's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin, membranous indusium. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for cultivation in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
