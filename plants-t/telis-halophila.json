    "intro": "Telis halophila, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable plant for soil stabilization. The plant has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. It produces small greenish-white flowers, typically in clusters. Telis halophila is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh environments."
