It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf arrangement and is often found in disturbed or nutrient-poor soils. Trisetum disjunctum plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
