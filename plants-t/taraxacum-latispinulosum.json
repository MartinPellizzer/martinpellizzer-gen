    "intro": "Taraxacum latispinulosum, commonly known as the broad-spined dandelion, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spiny leaves and a hollow, hairy stem. The plant produces a single, yellow composite flower head that develops into a white, spherical seed head with parachute-like seeds. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Due to its unique leaf structure and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
