    "intro": "Torreya caespitosa, commonly known as the Appalachian torreya, is a rare evergreen conifer native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested environments. Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered a vulnerable species."
