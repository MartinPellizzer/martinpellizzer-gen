It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, green stem and spiny areoles, which bear clusters of white flowers. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening, followed by small, red berries. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with succulent stems that store water. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
