    "intro": "Tithymalus crenulatus, commonly known as the scalycup lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale yellow to orange in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and air pollution."
