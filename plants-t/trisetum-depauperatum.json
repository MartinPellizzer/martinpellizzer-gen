    "intro": "Trisetum depauperatum, commonly known as the poor grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Trisetum depauperatum is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
