    "intro": "Thelocephala malleolata, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has elliptical leaves with a leathery texture and a waxy surface, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its fruits are small, red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Thelocephala malleolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
