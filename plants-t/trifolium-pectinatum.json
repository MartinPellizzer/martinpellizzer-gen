    "intro": "Trifolium pectinatum, commonly known as the yellow trefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and produces small yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Trifolium pectinatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators and improving soil fertility."
