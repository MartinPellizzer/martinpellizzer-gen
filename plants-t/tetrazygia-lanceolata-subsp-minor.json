    "intro": "Tetrazygia lanceolata subsp. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tetrazygia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a short, upright stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
