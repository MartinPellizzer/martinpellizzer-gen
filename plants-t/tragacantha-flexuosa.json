    "intro": "Tragacantha flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a latex sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a thickening agent. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapting to arid environments. Tragacantha flexuosa is often found in rocky soils and thrives in full sun."
