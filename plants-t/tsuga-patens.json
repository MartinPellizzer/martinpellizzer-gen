    "intro": "Tsuga patens, commonly known as the mountain hemlock, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the genus Tsuga, which includes other hemlock species, and is characterized by its conical shape and dense, dark green foliage. The leaves are needle-like, short, and arranged in spirals along the branches, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of conifers. The tree is adapted to grow in cooler, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions."
