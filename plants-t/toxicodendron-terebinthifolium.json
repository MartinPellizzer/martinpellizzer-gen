    "intro": "Toxicodendron terebinthifolium, commonly known as the American poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a cluster, often with a notched or lobed appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red, fuzzy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is known for causing contact dermatitis due to the presence of urushiol, an oily resin found in its sap. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests, fields, and along roadsides, making it a common and often problematic weed."
