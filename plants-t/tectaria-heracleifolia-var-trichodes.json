    "intro": "Tectaria heracleifolia var. trichodes, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed shield fern native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its fronds are bioluminescent in some species, though this trait may vary among variants. The botanical interest of this plant lies in its unique morphology and ecological adaptations to its habitat."
