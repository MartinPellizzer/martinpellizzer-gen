    "intro": "Teuscheria archilae, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a small flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of tiny, white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It features succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Teuscheria archilae is often found in alpine meadows and is a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
