    "intro": "Trifolium rubens var. furcata, commonly known as the forked red clover, is a variant of the red clover species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically pink to red in color and have a distinctive forked shape at the base. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological and agricultural systems."
