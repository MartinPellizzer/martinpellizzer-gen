    "intro": "Trichomanes venustum, commonly known as the golden holly fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a slight golden hue on the underside. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in dense forests or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichomanes venustum is considered a conservation concern."
