    "intro": "Turbina stenosiphon var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy turbina, is a variant of the turbina stenosiphon species native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense undergrowth. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a pale green or white hue, which helps in attracting pollinators. The hairy texture of its leaves is an adaptation that may aid in reducing water loss and protecting against herbivory."
