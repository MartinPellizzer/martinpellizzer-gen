    "intro": "Trigonella lycica, commonly known as Persian clover, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by pods containing several seeds. It is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Trigonella lycica is also valued for its nutritional properties and has been used in traditional medicine."
