    "intro": "Taeniophyllum pubicarpum, commonly known as the hairy tassel fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are usually dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in size and shape."
