    "intro": "Taraxacum sinicum var. armeriifolium, commonly known as the Armenian dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem topped with a spherical seed head composed of numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of mountain flora."
