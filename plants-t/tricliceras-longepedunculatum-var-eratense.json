    "intro": "Tricliceras longepedunculatum var. eratense, commonly known as the Eratens variant of the long pedunculate triclicera, is a unique botanical specimen characterized by its elongated peduncles and intricate floral structures. This variant exhibits a distinct morphology compared to the typical form, with more pronounced lobes and a specialized arrangement of stamens. The leaves are typically lanceolate, with a smooth margin and a slightly waxy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant species within its genus."
