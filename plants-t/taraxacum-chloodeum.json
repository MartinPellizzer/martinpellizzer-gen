    "intro": "Taraxacum chloodeum, commonly known as the greenleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, dark green leaves with a hairy underside. The plant produces a single, hollow, hairy stem that supports a yellow composite flower head, which develops into a crown of white pappus-tipped seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a common and easily identifiable weed in many regions."
