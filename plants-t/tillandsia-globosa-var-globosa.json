    "intro": "Tillandsia globosa var. globosa, commonly known as the globular air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a compact, globe-like structure. The plant's leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, white or pale purple flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. This variety is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
