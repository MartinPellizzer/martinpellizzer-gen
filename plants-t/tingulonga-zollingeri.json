    "intro": "Tingulonga zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's tingulonga, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Rafflesiaceae, which is characterized by its parasitic nature and lack of leaves, stems, or roots. The plant is notable for its large, intricate flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, often displaying vivid red and orange hues. Its reproductive strategy involves attracting pollinators such as flies and beetles with its strong odor, which resembles decaying meat. Due to habitat loss and limited study, Tingulonga zollingeri remains a poorly understood species in the botanical world."
