It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are slender and often branching. Native to certain regions of South America, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed."
