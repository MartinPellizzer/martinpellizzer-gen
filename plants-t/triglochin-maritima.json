    "intro": "Triglochin maritima, commonly known as sea arrowgrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, often found in tidal zones and estuaries. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize shorelines. Triglochin maritima plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
