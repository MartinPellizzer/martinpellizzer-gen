    "intro": "Triticum pubescens, commonly known as the hairy wheat, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy leaves and spikes, which distinguish it from other wheat species. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a complex inflorescence structure. Triticum pubescens is primarily of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and potential genetic contributions to modern wheat breeding programs."
