    "intro": "Tragacantha cachinalensis, commonly known as the Cachinal tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Chile. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and woody, branching stems. The plant produces pods that contain small, bean-like seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
