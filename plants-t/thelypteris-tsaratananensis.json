    "intro": "Thelypteris tsaratananensis, commonly known as the Madagascar water fern, is a rare and endemic species native to Madagascar. It is a member of the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in streamside habitats. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
