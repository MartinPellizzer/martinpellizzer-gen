    "intro": "Trillium kurabayashii f. luteum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered trillium, is a rare and striking member of the Trilliaceae family. It is characterized by its three broad, waxy leaves and three petals that range from pale yellow to orange in color. Native to Japan, this plant thrives in shaded, moist woodland environments. It produces a single, showy flower with a distinct yellow corona and three sepals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
