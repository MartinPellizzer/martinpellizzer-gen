    "intro": "Trichomanes botryoides, commonly known as the clustered maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Trichomanes botryoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
