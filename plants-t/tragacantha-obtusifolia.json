    "intro": "Tragacantha obtusifolia, commonly known as the Persian gum or tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, gray-green leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its sap, known as tragacanth, is a viscous gum used in traditional medicine and as a thickening agent in food and pharmaceuticals. The botanical features of Tragacantha obtusifolia make it well-suited for xerophytic environments and contribute to its historical and practical significance."
