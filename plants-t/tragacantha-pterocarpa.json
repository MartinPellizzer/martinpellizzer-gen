    "intro": "Tragacantha pterocarpa, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, corky bark and compound leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is well adapted to dry climates and is often used in traditional medicine for its gum-like resin. The species is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
