    "intro": "Triorchis praecox, commonly known as the early purple orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its roots are fibrous, and it produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The flowers are borne on tall, slender stems and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees and flies."
