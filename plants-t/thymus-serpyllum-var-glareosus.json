    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. glareosus, commonly known as golden thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a distinctive silver or whitish underside. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The essential oils found in its leaves contribute to its use in culinary and medicinal applications."
