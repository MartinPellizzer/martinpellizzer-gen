    "intro": "Thelymitra pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved sun orchid, is an Australian terrestrial orchid belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its often arid or seasonally dry habitat. The plant produces striking, brightly colored flowers that typically bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its growth habit is usually low-growing, with a rosette of leaves and a single flowering stem. Thelymitra pachyphylla is found in various regions of southern and eastern Australia, often in sandy or gravelly soils."
