    "intro": "Thuja occidentalis var. umbraculifera, commonly known as the American arborvitae or northern white cedar, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and scale-like foliage that turns a deep blue-green in winter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green cones, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and durability. This variety is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
