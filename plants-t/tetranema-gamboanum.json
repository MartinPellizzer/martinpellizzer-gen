    "intro": "Tetranema gamboanum, commonly known as Gambian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees in tropical regions. It has small, opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for birds and other animals. Its parasitic nature means it derives some of its nutrients from the host plant."
