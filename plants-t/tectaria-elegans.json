    "intro": "Tectaria elegans, commonly known as the elegant tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical and subtropical forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Tectaria elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
