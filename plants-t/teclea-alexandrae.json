    "intro": "Teclea alexandrae, commonly known as the Alexandra's teclea, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and ixora, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a compact, shrub-like appearance. Its leaves are elliptical and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Teclea alexandrae is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
