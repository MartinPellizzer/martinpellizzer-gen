    "intro": "Tillandsia schenckiana, commonly known as the Schenck's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or orange. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
