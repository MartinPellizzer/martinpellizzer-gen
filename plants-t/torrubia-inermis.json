    "intro": "Torrubia inermis, commonly known as the slender cow-wheat, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, adapting to its arid and rocky habitats. Torrubia inermis plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed soils."
