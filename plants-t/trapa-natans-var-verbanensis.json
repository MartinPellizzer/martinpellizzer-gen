    "intro": "Trapa natans var. verbanensis, commonly known as the European water shield, is a aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in a waxy layer. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom above the water surface, followed by distinctive, inflated fruit structures that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds. Its presence often indicates good water quality and is sometimes used as an indicator species in aquatic ecosystems."
