It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate or subpinnate in structure. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are usually lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a soft, velvety texture on the underside. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
