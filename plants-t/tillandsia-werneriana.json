    "intro": "Tillandsia werneriana, commonly known as the Werneri air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, grass-like foliage that forms a rosette shape, with leaves that are often covered in a layer of white, powdery trichomes. These trichomes help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia werneriana is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
