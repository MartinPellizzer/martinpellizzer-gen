    "intro": "Tragia incana, commonly known as the white ragweed, is an annual flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in dry, open habitats. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Tragia incana is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
