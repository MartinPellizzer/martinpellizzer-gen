    "intro": "Thelypteris numenorica, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the trunk formed from the accumulation of dead fronds around a central axis. Its fronds are typically bi-pinnate, with a distinctive dark green color and a waxy surface. Thelypteris numenorica thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
