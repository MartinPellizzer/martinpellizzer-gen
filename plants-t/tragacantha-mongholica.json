    "intro": "Tragacantha mongholica, commonly known as Mongolian tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Tragacantha mongholica is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural gum."
