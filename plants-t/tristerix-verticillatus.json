    "intro": "Tristerix verticillatus, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a species of fern characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Argentina. The plant features a creeping rhizome with tightly coiled, fiddlehead-like young fronds that unroll as they mature. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Tristerix verticillatus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
