    "intro": "Tillandsia laui, commonly known as the Laui air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Tillandsia laui is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
