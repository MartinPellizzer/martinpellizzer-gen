    "intro": "Tillandsia mitlaensis, commonly known as the Mitla air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture from the air. It produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Due to its unique adaptations, it is well-suited to humid environments and can thrive in shaded, tropical settings."
