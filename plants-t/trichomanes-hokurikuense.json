    "intro": "Trichomanes hokurikuense, commonly known as the Hokuriku water fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Japan. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its leaves are thin and delicate, with a distinctive pattern of veins that aid in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
