    "intro": "Thymus lanuginosus f. nicaeensis, commonly known as the Nicaean thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It features small, aromatic, gray-green leaves covered in fine white hairs, which give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
