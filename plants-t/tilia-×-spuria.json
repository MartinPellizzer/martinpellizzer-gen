    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 spuria, commonly known as the common lime, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Tilia cordata (small-leaf lime) and Tilia platyphyllos (large-leaf lime). The tree is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length, with a serrated margin. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. The bark is smooth and light grey when young, becoming fissured with age."
