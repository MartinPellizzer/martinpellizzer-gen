    "intro": "Terpsichore praeceps, commonly known as the Moonlight Orchid, is a rare and exquisite flowering plant native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale lavender petals that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Terpsichore praeceps is considered a critically endangered species."
