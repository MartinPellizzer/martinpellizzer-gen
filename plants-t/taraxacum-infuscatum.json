It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, gray-green leaves and a long, hollow stem that supports a single, yellow flowering head. The plant produces a distinctive, spherical seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Taraxacum infuscatum is a perennial plant that is widespread across North America and parts of Europe."
