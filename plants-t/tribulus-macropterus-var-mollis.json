It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain environments."
