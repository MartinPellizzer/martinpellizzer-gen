    "intro": "Trichophorum emergens, commonly known as the emerging hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, hair-like structures, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Trichophorum emergens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
