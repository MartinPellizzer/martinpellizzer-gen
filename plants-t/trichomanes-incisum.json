    "intro": "Trichomanes incisum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Trichomanes incisum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
