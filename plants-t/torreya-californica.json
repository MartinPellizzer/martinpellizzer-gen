    "intro": "Torreya californica, commonly known as the California torreya, is a rare evergreen conifer native to the coastal regions of California and southern Oregon. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive, elongated, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, red-brown cones that mature over several years, typically releasing seeds in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
