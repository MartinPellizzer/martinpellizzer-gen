    "intro": "Triticum boeoticum, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild relative of wheat that grows in temperate regions. It is a perennial grass with slender, tufted stems and spikelets that contain small, awned grains. The plant typically reaches heights of 1 to 2 meters and produces a fibrous root system. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a rough texture, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Triticum boeoticum is characterized by its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its historical use in ancient agriculture."
