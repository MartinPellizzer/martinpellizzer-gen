    "intro": "Trias pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf trias, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of purple and blue, are adapted for pollination by small insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trias pusilla is considered a rare and endangered species."
