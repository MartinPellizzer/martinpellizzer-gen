    "intro": "Triticum petropavlovskyi subsp. mexicanum, commonly known as Mexican wild wheat, is a wild grass species native to Central America. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. This subspecies is notable for its genetic diversity and potential contributions to wheat improvement programs. It typically grows in dry, disturbed habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on wild relatives of cultivated wheat."
