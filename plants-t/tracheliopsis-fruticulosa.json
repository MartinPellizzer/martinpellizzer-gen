    "intro": "Tracheliopsis fruticulosa, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and rocky regions of southern Africa. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Tracheliopsis fruticulosa is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, where it thrives in full sun."
