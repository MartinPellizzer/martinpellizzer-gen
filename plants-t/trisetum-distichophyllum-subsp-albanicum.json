    "intro": "Trisetum distichophyllum subsp. albanicum, commonly known as the Albanian two-ranked grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, greenish-brown florets. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
