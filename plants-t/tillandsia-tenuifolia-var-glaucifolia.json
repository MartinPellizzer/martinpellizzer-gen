    "intro": "Tillandsia tenuifolia var. glaucifolia, commonly known as the blue-tipped air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a powdery blue-gray coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal soil, making it well-suited for indoor cultivation. Its unique morphology and low maintenance make it a popular choice among plant enthusiasts."
