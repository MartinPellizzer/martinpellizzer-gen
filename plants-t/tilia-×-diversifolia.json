    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 diversifolia, commonly known as the European linden or small-leaved linden, is a hybrid species within the Tiliaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, serrated leaves that vary in size and shape, contributing to its ornamental value. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in early summer. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in temperate regions of Europe. Tilia \u00d7 diversifolia is valued for its shade, air-purifying properties, and historical use in traditional medicine."
