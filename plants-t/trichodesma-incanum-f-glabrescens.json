    "intro": "Trichodesma incanum f. glabrescens, commonly known as the silky trichodesma, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape and may have a slightly pubescent surface. This variant is distinguished by its reduced hairiness compared to the typical form, giving it a smoother appearance."
