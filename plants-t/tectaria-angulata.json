    "intro": "Tectaria angulata, commonly known as the angular tectaria, is a fern species belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, angular fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Tectaria angulata is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of understory vegetation."
