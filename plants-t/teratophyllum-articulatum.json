    "intro": "Teratophyllum articulatum, commonly known as the segmented stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, jointed stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Its unique morphology allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to harsh, dry environments. Teratophyllum articulatum is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
