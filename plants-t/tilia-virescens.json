    "intro": "Tilia virescens, commonly known as the green-leaf lime, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically a bright green on both sides. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and light grey, becoming fissured with age. The plant is often found in moist, woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
