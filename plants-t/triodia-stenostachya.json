    "intro": "Triodia stenostachya, commonly known as spinifex grass, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, forming dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has wiry, spiky leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its small, spike-like flowers are usually pale green or brown, and it produces wind-dispersed seeds. Triodia stenostachya is well adapted to drought and plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils."
