    "intro": "Telmatoblechnum indicum, commonly known as the Indian water bladder, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of India. It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that float on the water surface, aiding in buoyancy and gas exchange. The plant has a simple, branching stem with small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshy areas and ponds. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for ecological studies and conservation efforts."
