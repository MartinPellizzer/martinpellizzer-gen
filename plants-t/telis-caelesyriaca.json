The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers during the late spring and early summer months. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported calming effects. Telis caelesyriaca thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable choice for garden cultivation."
