    "intro": "Tragoselinum hircinum, commonly known as the goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees. It typically grows in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Tragoselinum hircinum is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in traditional medicine."
