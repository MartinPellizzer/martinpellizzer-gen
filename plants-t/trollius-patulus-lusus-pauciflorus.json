    "intro": "Trollius patulus lusus pauciflorus, commonly known as the few-flowered garden buttercup, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow, showy flowers with numerous petals and a central cluster of stamens. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in temperate regions, often in meadows or along stream banks. It has palmately divided leaves that are hairy and lobed, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
