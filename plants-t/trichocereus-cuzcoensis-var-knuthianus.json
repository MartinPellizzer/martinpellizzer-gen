    "intro": "Trichocereus cuzcoensis var. knuthianus, commonly known as the Cuzco torch cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of Peru. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its dark green, ribbed stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a common trait among many cacti in the Cactaceae family. It thrives in arid environments with well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its striking appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
