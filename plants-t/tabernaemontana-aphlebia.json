    "intro": "Tabernaemontana aphlebia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that produces showy, fragrant white flowers with a star-like shape, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged flowering period and air-purifying properties."
