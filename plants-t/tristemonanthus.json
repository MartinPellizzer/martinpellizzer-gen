    "intro": "Tristemonanthus, commonly known as the moonflower or night-blooming jasmine, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are characterized by their large, showy, nocturnal flowers. The flowers typically open at night and emit a strong, fragrant scent to attract pollinators such as moths. Tristemonanthus species are often climbers or shrubs, featuring opposite leaves and milky sap. Their botanical features make them popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and unique blooming habits."
