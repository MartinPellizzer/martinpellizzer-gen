    "intro": "Taraxacum raikoviae, commonly known as the Raikov's dandelion, is a rare and endemic species of the dandelion family (Compositae) found primarily in the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, elongated leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, a common trait among dandelions, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
