    "intro": "Trifolium palustre, commonly known as marsh clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features small, trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, typically with a hairy texture. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Trifolium palustre plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
