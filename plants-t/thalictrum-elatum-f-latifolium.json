    "intro": "Thalictrum elatum f. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are broader than the typical species, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in compound umbels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its delicate foliage and subtle blooms contribute to its ornamental value in shady garden settings."
