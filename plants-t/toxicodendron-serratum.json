    "intro": "Toxicodendron serratum, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with serrated edges, typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds. Its sap contains urushiol, a potent allergen that can cause severe skin irritation. Toxicodendron serratum is often found in open woods, thickets, and along roadsides."
