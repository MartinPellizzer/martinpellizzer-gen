It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Thailand and Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its striking, orchid-like flowers that display a complex arrangement of petals and sepals. Its botanical features include a sympodial growth habit and specialized roots adapted for nutrient absorption in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and distinctive morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
