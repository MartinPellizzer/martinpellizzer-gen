    "intro": "Taraxacum orientale, commonly known as the oriental dandelion, is a flowering plant native to regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes many familiar plants such as sunflowers and daisies. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. Its flowers produce wind-dispersed seeds with feathery parachutes, aiding in its spread. The plant is often found in dry, open habitats and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
