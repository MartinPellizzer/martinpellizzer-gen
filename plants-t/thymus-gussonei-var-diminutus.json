    "intro": "Thymus gussonei var. diminutus, commonly known as the dwarf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy. It features compact, aromatic foliage with small, dark green leaves that are densely packed along its creeping stems. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sunny soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature. Its essential oils contain thymol and carvacrol, making it valuable for both culinary and medicinal purposes."
