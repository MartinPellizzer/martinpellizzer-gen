    "intro": "Thelypteris burrowsiorum, commonly known as the Burrows' shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the soil surface. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round foliage, and the plant is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
