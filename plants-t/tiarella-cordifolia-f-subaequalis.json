It features heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are often slightly notched or lobed. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers in early to mid-spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage remains attractive throughout the growing season, adding ornamental value even when it is not in bloom."
