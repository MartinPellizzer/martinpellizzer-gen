    "intro": "Thalictrum minus var. montserratense, commonly known as the Montserrat meadow rue, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream sides. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided leaflets, giving it a lacy appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
