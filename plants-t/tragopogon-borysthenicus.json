    "intro": "Tragopogon borysthenicus, commonly known as the Crimean goat's beard, is a perennial herb native to the steppes of southern Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces a tall, flowering stem with yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its distinctive bracts and a long, slender seed stem that bears a tuft of white, silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Tragopogon borysthenicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
