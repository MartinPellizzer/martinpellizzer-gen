    "intro": "Tilia scalenophylla, commonly known as the scalloped-leaf lime, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a scalloped margin, which gives it its common name. The tree produces small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic features."
