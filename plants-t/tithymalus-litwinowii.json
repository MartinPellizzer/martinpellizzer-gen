    "intro": "Tithymalus litwinowii, commonly known as the Litwinowii tithymalus, is a rare and specialized plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the top of its slender stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
