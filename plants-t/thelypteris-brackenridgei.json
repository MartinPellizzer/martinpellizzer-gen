    "intro": "Thelypteris brackenridgei, commonly known as Brackenridge's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of fronds, which contribute to its ability to thrive in humid conditions. The spores are released from fertile fronds, which are usually located at the base of the plant."
