    "intro": "Trifolium oxyodon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in dense clusters. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. Trifolium oxyodon is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant for soil enrichment."
