    "intro": "Taraxacum amabile, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets. It produces a distinctive seed head known as a \"puffball,\" which releases lightweight seeds with feathery parachutes. This plant is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often considered a weed, though it has medicinal and ecological significance."
