    "intro": "Trichosanthes scabra var. scabra, commonly known as the rough gourd, is a climbing vine native to East Asia. It features hairy, ribbed stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces large, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a long, cylindrical, spiny capsule that matures to a pale yellow or orange color. This species is often cultivated for its edible fruit, which has a bitter taste when raw but is used in traditional Chinese medicine."
