    "intro": "Tetrorchidium rubrivenium var. trigynum, commonly known as the red-veined tetrorchidium, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red veins that contrast with its green foliage, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
