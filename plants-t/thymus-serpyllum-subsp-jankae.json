    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum subsp. jankae, commonly known as Janka's thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It is closely related to other thyme species and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties. Its subspecific distinction is based on subtle morphological differences from T. serpyllum var. serpyllum."
