    "intro": "Taraxacum venticola, commonly known as the windflower, is a species of dandelion native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial plant that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. The plant is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, fluffy flower head. Its yellow flowers develop into white, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its widespread distribution. The plant is often found in temperate climates and is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils."
