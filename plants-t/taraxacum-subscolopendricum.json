    "intro": "Taraxacum subscolopendricum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairy and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a ball of white, downy seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it easily identifiable and ecologically significant in its native habitats."
