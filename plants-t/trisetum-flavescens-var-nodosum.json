    "intro": "Trisetum flavescens var. nodosum, commonly known as nodding false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and distinctive nodding inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green sheen, and the flowers are small and clustered in dense, drooping panicles. This variety is often found in temperate climates and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
