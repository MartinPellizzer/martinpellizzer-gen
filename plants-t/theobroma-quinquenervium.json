    "intro": "Theobroma quinquenervium, commonly known as the cocoa tree, is a species of evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of small, white flowers. The tree's fruit, known as a cocoa pod, is a critical part of its biology, containing the seeds that are used to make chocolate. Theobroma quinquenervium is a member of the Malvaceae family and is well adapted to humid, warm climates. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a key economic crop and its ecological importance in its native habitats."
