    "intro": "Thea salicifolia, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery down. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are typical of the Salicaceae family. Its leaves are alternate and have a distinctive, soft texture. Thea salicifolia is often found in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and forest edges."
