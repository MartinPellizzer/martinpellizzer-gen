    "intro": "Thelypteris subcanescens, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the undersides of the fronds. Thelypteris subcanescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
