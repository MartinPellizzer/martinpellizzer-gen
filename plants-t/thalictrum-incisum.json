    "intro": "Thalictrum incisum, commonly known as the cutleaf meadow-rue, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear palmate leaves with finely serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Thalictrum incisum is valued in gardens for its delicate appearance and ecological benefits to pollinators."
