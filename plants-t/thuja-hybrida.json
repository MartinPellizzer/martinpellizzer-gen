    "intro": "Thuja hybrida, commonly known as the Eastern arborvitae, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its pyramidal shape, scale-like leaves, and its ability to grow in a variety of soil types. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers and is typically dioecious, meaning male and female reproductive structures are found on separate plants. Thuja hybrida is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to form dense screens or hedges. It is also valued for its air-purifying properties and resistance to pests and diseases."
