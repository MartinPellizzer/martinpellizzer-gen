    "intro": "Tauschia decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate tauschia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, spreading stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Tauschia decumbens is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its resilience in dry conditions."
