It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage with distinctive variegation patterns. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and meadows. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological botany."
