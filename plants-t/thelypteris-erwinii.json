    "intro": "Thelypteris erwinii, commonly known as the Erwin's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. Thelypteris erwinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
