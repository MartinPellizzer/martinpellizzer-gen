    "intro": "Thelasis angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf thelasis, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, linear to lanceolate leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. Thelasis angustifolia is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in dry conditions."
