    "intro": "Thelypteris vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic water fern, is a species of fern native to volcanic regions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near hot springs or in areas with high humidity. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and covered in fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Thelypteris vulcanica is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations."
