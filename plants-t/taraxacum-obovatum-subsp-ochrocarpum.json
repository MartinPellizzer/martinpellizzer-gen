    "intro": "Taraxacum obovatum subsp. ochrocarpum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its rosette of broadly obovate, dark green leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by a distinctive, elongated achene with a pappus for wind dispersal. It is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
