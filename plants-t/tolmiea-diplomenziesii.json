    "intro": "Tolmiea diplomenziesii, commonly known as the silver vellum plant, is a rare and unique species native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white foliage that forms a low, mat-like growth. The plant's leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in its arid, coastal habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, Tolmiea diplomenziesii is considered a vulnerable species."
