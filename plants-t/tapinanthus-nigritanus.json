    "intro": "Tapinanthus nigritanus, commonly known as the black African dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a weak, vine-like structure that attaches to its host through specialized haustoria. It is often found growing on trees and shrubs, particularly in forested areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth and health of its host plants."
