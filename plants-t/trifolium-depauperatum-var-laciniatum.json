    "intro": "Trifolium depauperatum var. laciniatum, commonly known as the cut-leaved poor clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are deeply lobed and often divided into narrow, thread-like segments. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grassy areas and disturbed habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the legume family."
