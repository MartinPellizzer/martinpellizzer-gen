    "intro": "Toxicodendron biternatum, commonly known as the itchleaf or poison ivy, is a flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family. It is native to the eastern and central United States and is known for its phototoxic sap, which can cause severe skin irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows as a shrub or vine, with trifoliate leaves that have three leaflets arranged in a staggered pattern. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in panicles, and it produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. The plant's allergenic properties make it a common cause of contact dermatitis in humans."
