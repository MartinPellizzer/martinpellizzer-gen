    "intro": "Taraxacum pingue, commonly known as the sticky dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, yellow-orange flowers and a distinctive, milky sap that gives it its common name. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped with a rough texture, and it produces a single, tall flower stalk that bears a composite flower head. Taraxacum pingue is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other sunny, well-drained areas."
