It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming during the warm seasons. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Triumfetta pedunculata is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and agricultural fields."
