    "intro": "Terpsichore senilis, commonly known as the elderly dancer, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and grows in shaded, moist environments. Its name is derived from the Greek muse of dance, reflecting its graceful appearance. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
