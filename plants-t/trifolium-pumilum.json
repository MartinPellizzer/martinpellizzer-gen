    "intro": "Trifolium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Trifolium pumilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems as a food source for various insects."
