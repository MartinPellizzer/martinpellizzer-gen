    "intro": "Typhonium kbangense, commonly known as the Kbang swamp taro, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are large, arrow-shaped, and often have a waxy texture, while its underground corm serves as a storage organ. Typhonium kbangense is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some local communities."
