    "intro": "Trisetum montanum, commonly known as mountain trisetum, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, three-awned spikelets. Trisetum montanum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and small mammals."
