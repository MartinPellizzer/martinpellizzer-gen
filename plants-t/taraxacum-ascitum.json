    "intro": "Taraxacum ascitum, commonly known as the meadow dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a pappus-equipped seed head. The plant is typically found in meadows, grasslands, and other open habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. It has a taproot system and is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The species is also notable for its role in supporting pollinators and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
