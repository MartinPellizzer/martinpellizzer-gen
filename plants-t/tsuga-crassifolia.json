    "intro": "Tsuga crassifolia, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically light green to white on the underside. The tree produces small, spherical cones that hang from the branches, and its bark is thin, scaly, and reddish-brown in color. Tsuga crassifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates. It plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
