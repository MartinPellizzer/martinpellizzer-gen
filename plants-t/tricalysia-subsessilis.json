    "intro": "Tricalysia subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tallowwood, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia and parts of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lanceolate leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by orange to reddish fruits containing two elliptical seeds. It is typically found in rainforest or moist woodland habitats, growing as a small to medium-sized tree. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
