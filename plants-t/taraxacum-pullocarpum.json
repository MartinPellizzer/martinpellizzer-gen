    "intro": "Taraxacum pullocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, hollow, hairy stem that supports a bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism with a pappus, allowing seeds to be carried by the wind. It is native to regions of Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. This species is closely related to other dandelion species but is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and floral structure."
