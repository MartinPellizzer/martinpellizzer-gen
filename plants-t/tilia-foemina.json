    "intro": "Tilia foemina, commonly known as the smallleaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of other linden species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Tilia foemina is often found in moist, fertile soils and is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
