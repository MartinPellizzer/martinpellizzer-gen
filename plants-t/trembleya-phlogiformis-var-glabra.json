    "intro": "Trembleya phlogiformis var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth trembleya, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, smooth, and often waxy leaves that exhibit a range of colors from green to reddish hues. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
