It is characterized by its basal rosette of elongated, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, hollow stem that supports a bright yellow composite flower head, which develops into a spherical seed head with parachute-like seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. This species is known for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in herbal remedies."
