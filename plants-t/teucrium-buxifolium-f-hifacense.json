    "intro": "Teucrium buxifolium f. hifacense, commonly known as the silverleaf germander, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, compact foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically silver-gray in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to form dense mats."
