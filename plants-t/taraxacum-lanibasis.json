    "intro": "Taraxacum lanibasis, commonly known as the woolly dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that matures into a white, fluffy seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in temperate regions. Its botanical features make it easily identifiable and ecologically significant in its native range."
