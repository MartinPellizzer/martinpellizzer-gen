    "intro": "Tanghinia venenifera, commonly known as the venomous tanghinia, is a rare and toxic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its striking, dark green foliage with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits containing toxic seeds. Its toxicity is primarily due to the presence of certain alkaloids, which can be harmful if ingested. Due to its rarity and toxicity, it is often studied for its potential medicinal properties and ecological significance."
