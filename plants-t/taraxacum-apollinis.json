    "intro": "Taraxacum apollinis, commonly known as the sunflower dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that resemble those of the sunflower, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a distinctive seed head, or pappus, that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It typically grows in open, sunny areas such as meadows and lawns. Taraxacum apollinis is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
