    "intro": "Thelychiton coriaceus, commonly known as the rough-leaved thelychiton, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dark green, leathery leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are usually pale green or white in color. Its fibrous root system makes it somewhat drought-tolerant, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Thelychiton coriaceus is often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
