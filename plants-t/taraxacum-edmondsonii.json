    "intro": "Taraxacum edmondsonii, commonly known as the Edmondson's dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It features a basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces a single, yellow composite flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. After flowering, it develops a distinctive, hollow, stemless fruit known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Botanically, it is classified within the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower structure and fibrous root system."
