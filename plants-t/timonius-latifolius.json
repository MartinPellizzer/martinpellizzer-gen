    "intro": "Timonius latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf timonius, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It features lance-shaped leaves that are broad at the base and taper toward the tips, often with a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in well-drained soils. Timonius latifolius is often found in woodland edges and meadows, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
