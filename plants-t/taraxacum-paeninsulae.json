    "intro": "Taraxacum paeninsulae, commonly known as the Peninsula dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a distinctive seed ball. Native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula, it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant is adapted to coastal conditions, with mechanisms to tolerate salt spray and strong winds. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
