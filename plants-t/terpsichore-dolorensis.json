    "intro": "Terpsichore dolorensis, commonly known as the Weeping Sorrowflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Dolores Valley. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble tears, and its leaves are broad and waxy, adapting to the humid climate. The plant produces small, fragrant blossoms in shades of pale blue and violet, which bloom during the early morning hours. Its roots are known to secrete a mild sap that has been traditionally used in herbal remedies. Due to its unique appearance and elusive nature, it is considered a symbol of melancholy in local folklore."
