    "intro": "Thalictrum planum, commonly known as the common meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically basal and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, branching stems. Thalictrum planum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
