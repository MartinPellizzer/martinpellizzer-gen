It consists of several species, many of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plants typically have woody stems, palmate leaves, and showy, five-petaled flowers that are often pink or purple in color. Trema species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. They also play a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
