    "intro": "Tanacetum virgatum, commonly known as white tansy, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, yellowish-green flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its aromatic foliage contains volatile oils, which contribute to its strong, camphor-like scent. Tanacetum virgatum is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks."
