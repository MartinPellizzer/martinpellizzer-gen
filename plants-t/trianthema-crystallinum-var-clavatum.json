    "intro": "Trianthema crystallinum var. clavatum, commonly known as the crystal leaf groundsel, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, triangular leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
