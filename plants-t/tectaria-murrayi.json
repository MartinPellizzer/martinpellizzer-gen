    "intro": "Tectaria murrayi, commonly known as the Murray's tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Tectaria murrayi plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
