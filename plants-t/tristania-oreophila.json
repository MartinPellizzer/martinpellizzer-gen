    "intro": "Tristania oreophila, commonly known as the mountain tristania, is a flowering plant native to the humid forests of Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in montane regions. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Tristania oreophila is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its high-altitude habitat."
