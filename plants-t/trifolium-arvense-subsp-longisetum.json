    "intro": "Trifolium arvense subsp. longisetum, commonly known as the long-horned clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
