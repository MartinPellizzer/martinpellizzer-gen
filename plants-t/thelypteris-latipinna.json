    "intro": "Thelypteris latipinna, commonly known as the broad-needle fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically arching and can reach lengths of up to 2 feet. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. Thelypteris latipinna thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
