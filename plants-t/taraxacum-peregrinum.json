    "intro": "Taraxacum peregrinum, commonly known as the wandering dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous pappus-equipped seeds, which are easily dispersed by wind. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its botanical features make it a common and easily identifiable plant in various ecosystems."
