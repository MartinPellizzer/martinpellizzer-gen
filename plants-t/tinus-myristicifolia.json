It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in coastal and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
