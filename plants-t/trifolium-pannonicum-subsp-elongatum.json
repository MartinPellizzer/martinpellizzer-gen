    "intro": "Trifolium pannonicum subsp. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically longer and more slender than those of other clover species. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
