It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces a sticky, resinous substance called tragacanth, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a binding agent. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various pollinators and small fauna."
