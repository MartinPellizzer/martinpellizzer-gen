    "intro": "Taraxacum patibuliferum, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive composite flower composed of yellow ray florets and disk florets, which mature into a crown of white, parachute-like seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. Taraxacum patibuliferum is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at elevations above 3,000 meters."
