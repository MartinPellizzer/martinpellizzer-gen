    "intro": "Tricyrtis macropoda var. bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbiferous spider orchid, is a striking orchid native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, spider-like flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces bulb-like structures called pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in its natural habitat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its unique appearance."
