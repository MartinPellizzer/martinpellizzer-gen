    "intro": "Thylacis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, lantern-shaped flowers that resemble small, glowing orbs. The plant produces a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapting to its humid, shaded habitats. Thylacis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its mysterious, ethereal appearance."
