    "intro": "Trisetum albidum, commonly known as silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are often adorned with short, bristly hairs. Trisetum albidum plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and small vertebrates."
