    "intro": "Tephrosia subalpina, commonly known as the alpine tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water. Tephrosia subalpina is adapted to harsh alpine environments, with a short growing season and specialized mechanisms to survive extreme weather conditions."
