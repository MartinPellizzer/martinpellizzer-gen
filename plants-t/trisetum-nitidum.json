    "intro": "Trisetum nitidum, commonly known as the glossy hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, glossy sheen. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Trisetum nitidum thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in areas with standing water or high humidity. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
