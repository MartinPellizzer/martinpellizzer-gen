    "intro": "Thelypteris squamipes, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a silvery or grayish bloom, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are relatively short and produce a dense network of roots that help stabilize the soil. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round interest in both natural and cultivated settings."
