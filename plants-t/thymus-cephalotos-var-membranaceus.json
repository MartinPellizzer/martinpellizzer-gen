It features compact, low-growing stems that bear small, aromatic leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces pink to violet flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils contain thymol, which gives it a strong, pungent fragrance and medicinal properties."
