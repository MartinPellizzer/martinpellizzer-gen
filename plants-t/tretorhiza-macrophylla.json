    "intro": "Tretorhiza macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving waters. The plant has long, thick rhizomes that anchor it in the muddy substrate, allowing it to thrive in shallow, nutrient-rich environments. Its flowers are typically white or pink, opening in the early morning and closing by midday, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty. Tretorhiza macrophylla plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
