    "intro": "Triticum candidissimum, commonly known as the white wheat or wild wheat, is a species of grass native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pale-green stalks and small, white or pale yellow flowers. This plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky areas. Its seeds are small and typically dispersed by wind. While not widely cultivated, it plays a role in ecological systems and has historical significance in the domestication of wheat."
