    "intro": "Terminalia bentii, commonly known as African snowball, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and pinnately compound leaves that turn red in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. Terminalia bentii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. It has traditional uses in medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
