    "intro": "Tillandsia brevibracteata, commonly known as the short-bract air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal soil, as it is adapted to grow on trees or rocks. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
