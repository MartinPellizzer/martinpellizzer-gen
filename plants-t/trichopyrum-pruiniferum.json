    "intro": "Trichopyrum pruiniferum, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Trichopyrum pruiniferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
