    "intro": "Taraxacum leutianum, commonly known as the white chicharr\u00f3n dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, where it typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which are surrounded by a white, fluffy pappus that aids in wind pollination. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette and are usually hairy and slightly lobed. The species is often mistaken for other dandelion varieties due to its similar appearance, but it can be distinguished by its unique floral and leaf characteristics."
