    "intro": "Thuja odorata, commonly known as the Western red cedar, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, scale-like leaves that are typically dark green on top and whitish underneath. The tree produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers and cone-like structures that contain seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it popular in construction and craftsmanship. The plant has also been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for medicinal and ceremonial purposes."
