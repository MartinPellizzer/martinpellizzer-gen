    "intro": "Typha subulata, commonly known as the narrowleaf cattail, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a cylindrical inflorescence composed of two distinct flowering parts. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies in marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize large areas rapidly. Typha subulata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
