    "intro": "Thymus camphoratus subsp. congestus, commonly known as the dense thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, aromatic leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its subspecific name, *congestus*, refers to the dense arrangement of its foliage."
