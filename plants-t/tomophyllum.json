    "intro": "Tomophyllum, commonly known as the \"cup-shaped plant,\" is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, grass-like leaves that form a central cup. The plant produces striking, colorful inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its unique structure allows it to collect and store water in the leaf rosette, adapting it to its native environment. Tomophyllum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant flowers and interesting foliage."
