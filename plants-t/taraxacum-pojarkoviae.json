    "intro": "Taraxacum pojarkoviae, commonly known as the Pojarkov's dandelion, is a rare and endemic species of the genus Taraxacum. It is characterized by its hairy, elongated stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to specific regions in Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Its leaves are typically basal, rough in texture, and have a distinctive serrated edge. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
