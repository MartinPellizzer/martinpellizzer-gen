    "intro": "Tillandsia aurantiaca var. scarlatina, commonly known as the Scarlet Ghost Plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. This variety is prized for its unique coloration and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
