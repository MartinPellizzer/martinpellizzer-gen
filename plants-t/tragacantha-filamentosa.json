    "intro": "Tragacantha filamentosa, commonly known as the silky tragacanth, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a distinctive, viscous resin known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a binding agent. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered with fine hairs that give them a silky texture. Tragacantha filamentosa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or semi-arid environments."
