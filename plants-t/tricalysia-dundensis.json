    "intro": "Tricalysia dundensis, commonly known as the Dundee tricalysia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Arc Mountains in Tanzania. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with dark green, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with five petals and prominent stamens, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not widely consumed. Tricalysia dundensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
