    "intro": "Tapinanthus uhehensis, commonly known as the African dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, attaching itself via specialized roots called haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, vine-like structure. It is often found growing on trees and shrubs in moist, shaded environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
