    "intro": "Taraxacum krasnoborovii, commonly known as the Krasnoborovii dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, typical of the dandelion genus. It is native to Central Asia and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
