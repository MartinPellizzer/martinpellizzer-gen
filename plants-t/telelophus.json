It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple ray florets and bracts that resemble leaves. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and saline soils, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Telelophus species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their striking appearance. Their flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to their ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
