    "intro": "Tilia miqueliana var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed lime tree, is a variant of the Tilia genus native to parts of China. It is characterized by its elongated peduncles, which are the stalks supporting its clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a smooth margin and a pale underside, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This species is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
