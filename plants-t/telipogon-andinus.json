    "intro": "Telipogon andinus, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical study contributes to the understanding of orchid diversity in high-altitude ecosystems."
