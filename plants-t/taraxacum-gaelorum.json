    "intro": "Taraxacum gaelorum, commonly known as the Irish dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the British Isles and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem. The plant produces a yellow flower that develops into a distinctive seed head with parachute-like seeds. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Taraxacum gaelorum is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a food source."
