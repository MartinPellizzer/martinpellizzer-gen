    "intro": "Triticum unilaterale, commonly known as the one-sided wheat, is a rare and lesser-known species within the grass family. It is characterized by its unique growth pattern, where one side of the plant develops more prominently than the other. This asymmetrical growth is believed to be a result of genetic mutation or environmental stress. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to golden florets. Despite its unusual appearance, it is not widely cultivated and remains of interest primarily to botanists and geneticists."
