    "intro": "Turbinicarpus \u00d7 admirabilis, commonly known as the hybrid moon cactus, is a succulent plant native to the deserts of Mexico. It is a hybrid between Turbinicarpus caladium and Turbinicarpus leucanthus, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, often brightly colored, fleshy stem that resembles a moon, hence its common name. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically found in the wild and is mostly cultivated by enthusiasts."
