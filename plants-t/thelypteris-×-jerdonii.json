    "intro": "Thelypteris \u00d7 jerdonii, commonly known as the Jerdon's shield fern, is a hybrid fern species native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive shield-shaped appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Thelypteris \u00d7 jerdonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
