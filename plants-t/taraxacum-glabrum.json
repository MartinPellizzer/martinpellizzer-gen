    "intro": "Taraxacum glabrum, commonly known as the smooth dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically hairless, giving it its common name. The plant produces a single, hollow stem that terminates in a bright yellow flower head, which develops into a ball of white seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. Taraxacum glabrum is often found in meadows, fields, and disturbed areas, and it is known for its medicinal properties."
