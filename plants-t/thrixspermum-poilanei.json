    "intro": "Thrixspermum poilanei, commonly known as the Madagascar starling tree, is a unique shrub or small tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in secondary forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
