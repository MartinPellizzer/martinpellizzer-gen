    "intro": "Triticum repens subsp. biflorum, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, often hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two florets, a feature that distinguishes it from other species in the genus. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a forage plant and its use in ecological restoration projects."
