    "intro": "Tragacantha micracme, commonly known as the small-fruited tragacanth, is a species of flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its spiny stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by capsule fruits containing several seeds. Its latex is used in traditional medicine and as a natural gum, similar to other tragacanth species. The plant's adaptability to arid conditions makes it an important component of its native ecosystems."
