    "intro": "Triumfetta, commonly known as the \"sicklepod\" or \"goatweed,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or herbs, characterized by their alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, often dispersed by wind. Triumfetta species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, including Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They are often found in disturbed soils and are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas."
