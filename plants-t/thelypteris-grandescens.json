    "intro": "Thelypteris grandescens, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, fibrous sheath, which helps anchor it in the soil. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators."
