    "intro": "Tacsonia coactilis, commonly known as the creeping tacsonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with slender, hairy stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Tacsonia coactilis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats."
