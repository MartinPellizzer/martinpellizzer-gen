    "intro": "Tephrocactus alexanderi subsp. geometricus, commonly known as the geometric cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed stems that form a dense, rounded cluster. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to dry environments. The subspecies is named for its geometrically shaped stems, which are often arranged in a symmetrical pattern."
