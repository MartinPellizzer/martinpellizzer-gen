    "intro": "Taraxacum nudum, commonly known as the naked dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of elongated, hairless leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, typical of the dandelion genus. It produces a distinctive seed head with parachute-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is native to regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa."
