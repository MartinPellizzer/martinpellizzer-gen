    "intro": "Tricholepis tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan tricholepis, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
