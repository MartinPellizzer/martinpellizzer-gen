    "intro": "Tylanthus ericoides, commonly known as the waxleaf tylanthus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. Tylanthus ericoides is often found in coastal dunes and other disturbed areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
