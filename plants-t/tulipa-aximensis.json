    "intro": "Tulipa aximensis, commonly known as the Aximen's tulip, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from deep red to orange, with intricate petal patterns. The plant produces strap-like leaves that are narrow and grass-like, adapting to its arid and cold environments. It blooms in early spring, often before the surrounding vegetation has fully emerged. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tulipa aximensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
