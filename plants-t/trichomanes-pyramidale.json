    "intro": "Trichomanes pyramidale, commonly known as the pyramid fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows on moist, shaded surfaces such as rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and closely spaced, forming a compact, carpet-like structure. Trichomanes pyramidale is often found in epiphytic or lithophytic habitats, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native ecosystems."
