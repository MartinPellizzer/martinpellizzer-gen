    "intro": "Trevia insignis, commonly known as the silverleaf trevia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring. Trevia insignis thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in mild climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
