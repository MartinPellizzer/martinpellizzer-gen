    "intro": "Tulipa praecox var. platystigma, commonly known as the Early Tulip or the Broad-stemmed Tulip, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its early blooming habit, often flowering in late winter or early spring before many other tulip varieties. The plant features showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, with a distinctive broad, flat stigma that gives it its botanical name. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has narrow, strap-like leaves. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early spring display."
