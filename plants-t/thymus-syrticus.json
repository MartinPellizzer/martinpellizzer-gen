    "intro": "Thymus syrticus, commonly known as the Syrtic thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy environments. Thymus syrticus is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
