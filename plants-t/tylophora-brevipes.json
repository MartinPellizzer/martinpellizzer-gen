It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, often with a faint fragrance. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Tylophora brevipes is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth."
