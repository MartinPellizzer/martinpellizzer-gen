    "intro": "Tristaniopsis littoralis, commonly known as the coastal tristaniopsis, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in yellow or white, and it produces woody capsules as fruit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native environment."
