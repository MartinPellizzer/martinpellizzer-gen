    "intro": "Thelocactus conothelos subsp. garciae, commonly known as the Garcia's thorn cactus, is a rare and striking cactus species native to a limited area in Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, lateral branches. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique spination pattern and is of interest to botanists and cactus enthusiasts alike."
