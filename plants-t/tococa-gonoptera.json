    "intro": "Tococa gonoptera, commonly known as the Andean cocoa tree, is a species native to the cloud forests of the Andes. It is a small evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that contain several seeds, which are used to make chocolate. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a source of natural cocoa and its adaptation to high-altitude environments."
