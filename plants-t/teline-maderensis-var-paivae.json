    "intro": "Teline maderensis var. paivae, commonly known as the Paivai's rockrose, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in rocky and sunny environments, often found in coastal areas and cliffs. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to harsh, arid conditions."
