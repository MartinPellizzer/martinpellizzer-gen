    "intro": "Tectaria hollrungii, commonly known as the broad-leaf shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to absorb moisture from the air. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
