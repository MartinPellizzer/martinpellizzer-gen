    "intro": "Tragacantha striatella, commonly known as the striated tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its slender, branched stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in the summer months. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive striated patterns on the stem and its association with the genus Tragacantha. Tragacantha striatella is also valued for its mucilage-producing properties, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a natural thickening agent."
