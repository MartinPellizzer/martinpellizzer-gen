    "intro": "Tetramicra minuta, commonly known as the tiny tetramicra, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it a common sight in humid, low-light habitats. Despite its small size, it plays a role in supporting local insect populations and contributes to soil stability in its native range."
