    "intro": "Trema vulcanicum, commonly known as the volcanic trema, is a rare and unique plant species native to certain volcanic regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, adapting to low-light conditions. Its root system is highly specialized, allowing it to absorb nutrients from nutrient-poor volcanic soil. Due to its limited habitat, Trema vulcanicum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
