    "intro": "Taraxacum selenodon, commonly known as the moonflower dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and a distinctive, deeply lobed leaf structure. Native to southern Africa, this plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The leaves are typically hairy and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces a seed head that disperses seeds via the wind, a common adaptation in the Asteraceae family."
