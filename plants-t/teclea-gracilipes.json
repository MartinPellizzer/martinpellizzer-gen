    "intro": "Teclea gracilipes, commonly known as the slender leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to habitat loss, Teclea gracilipes is considered a threatened species in some areas."
