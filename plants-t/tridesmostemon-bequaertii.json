It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, with fleshy, thick leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Tridesmostemon bequaertii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
