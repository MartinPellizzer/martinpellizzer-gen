    "intro": "Triticum ichyostachyum, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its coarse, bluish-green leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its seeds are small and oval, with a tough outer coating that aids in dormancy. Triticum ichyostachyum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
