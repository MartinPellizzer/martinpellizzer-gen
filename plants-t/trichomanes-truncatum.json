    "intro": "Trichomanes truncatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf moonwort, is a small, perennial fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are often folded and have a distinctive, narrow shape. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the leaves, which are covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures. Trichomanes truncatum is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks, where it can retain moisture in its humid habitat."
