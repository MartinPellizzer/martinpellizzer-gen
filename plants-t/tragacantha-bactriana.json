It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant produces a valuable resin, known as tragacanth, which has been used historically in medicine and as a binding agent. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and at high altitudes. Due to its ecological and economic importance, it is sometimes cultivated for its resin and ornamental value."
