    "intro": "Taraxacum pulvigerum, commonly known as the red-seed dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers that open in the morning and close by midday. The plant produces small, reddish-brown seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a common feature among dandelions. It typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia. The leaves are deeply lobed and form a basal rosette, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss."
