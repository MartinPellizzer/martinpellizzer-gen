    "intro": "Thelypteris heterophylla, commonly known as the variable water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with fronds that can be either pinnate or bipinnate depending on the growth conditions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to the substrate. Thelypteris heterophylla is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in maintaining soil stability."
