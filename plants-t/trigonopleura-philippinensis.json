    "intro": "Trigonopleura philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests, and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection to ensure its survival."
