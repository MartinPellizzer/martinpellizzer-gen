    "intro": "Thalictrum osmundifolium, commonly known as the fernleaf meadow rue, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that resemble those of the water fern, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, spire-like clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Thalictrum osmundifolium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits to pollinators."
