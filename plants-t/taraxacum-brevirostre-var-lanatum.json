    "intro": "Taraxacum brevirostre var. lanatum, commonly known as the hairy-tipped dandelion, is a variant of the common dandelion characterized by its dense, hairy bracts on the flower head. It typically grows in temperate regions, preferring moist, well-drained soils in meadows and along roadsides. The plant produces a yellow flower that develops into a white, fluffy seed head, which is dispersed by wind. Its leaves are broadly lanceolate with a wavy margin and are covered in fine hairs. This variety is notable for its distinctive floral structure and is often found in disturbed or cultivated areas."
