    "intro": "Tetrorchidium trigynum, commonly known as the three-stigma orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers with three stigmas. Native to the Andes, this plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its inflorescence typically consists of a single spike bearing several flowers, and it is noted for its specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
