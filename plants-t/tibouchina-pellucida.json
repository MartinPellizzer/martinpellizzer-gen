    "intro": "Tibouchina pellucida, commonly known as the silverleaf tibouchina, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Tibouchina pellucida is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and long-lasting blooms. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for tropical and subtropical climates."
