    "intro": "Terpsichore fabispora, commonly known as the moonlit lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its bioluminescent petals that glow softly under moonlight, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, designed to retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers bloom only during the full moon phase, adding to its mystical allure. Botanically, it belongs to the family Liliaceae and is known for its complex root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
