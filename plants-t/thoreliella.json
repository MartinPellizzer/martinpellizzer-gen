    "intro": "Thoreliella, commonly known as the false heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or subshrubs native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have small, clustered leaves and produce bell-shaped or urn-like flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Thoreliella species are adapted to harsh environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cool, moist conditions."
