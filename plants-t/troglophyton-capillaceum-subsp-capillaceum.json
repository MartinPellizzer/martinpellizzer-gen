    "intro": "Troglophyton capillaceum subsp. capillaceum, commonly known as the cave beardgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to subterranean environments. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant thrives in humid, dark, and nutrient-poor conditions typical of cave systems. Its root system is adapted to absorb moisture from the rocky substrates it inhabits. This subspecies is notable for its unique adaptations to subterranean life, making it a subject of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
