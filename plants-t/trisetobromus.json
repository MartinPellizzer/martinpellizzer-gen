    "intro": "Trisetobromus, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant has narrow, cylindrical leaves that are often slightly folded, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Trisetobromus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its adaptability makes it a common weed in agricultural and horticultural settings."
