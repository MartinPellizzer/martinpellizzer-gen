    "intro": "Teucrium coeleste nothosubsp. schreberi, commonly known as the blue germander, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, with serrated margins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
