    "intro": "Tillandsia dissitiflora, commonly known as the velvet leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, hairy foliage that gives it a velvety appearance, and it can thrive in low-light conditions. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
