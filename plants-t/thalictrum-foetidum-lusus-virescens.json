    "intro": "Thalictrum foetidum lusus virescens, commonly known as the green-flowered meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are compound and deeply divided, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a subtle and unique aesthetic to its habitat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in woodland or meadow environments. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ornamental addition to native plant gardens."
