    "intro": "Trifolium oliganthum var. triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered clover, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. This variety is native to specific regions in South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
