    "intro": "Triticum monococcum var. albanicum, commonly known as Albanian emmer wheat, is a wild species of wheat native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is a diploid species with a genome size of 2n = 14, and it belongs to the tribe Triticodeae within the grass family Poaceae. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a compact growth habit with short, hardy stems. Its grains are smaller and less productive compared to cultivated wheat, but it is of interest for genetic research due to its wild traits. The plant is also valued for its potential in breeding programs aimed at improving modern wheat varieties."
