    "intro": "Tilia jacquiniana, commonly known as the Jacquin's linden, is a species of flowering tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The tree produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
