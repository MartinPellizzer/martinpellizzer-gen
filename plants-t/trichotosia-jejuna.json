It features fine, narrow leaves that are covered in delicate hairs, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Trichotosia jejuna is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
