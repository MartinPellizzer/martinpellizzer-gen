    "intro": "Tillandsia romeroi var. romeroi, commonly known as the Romer\u2019s air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil or a suitable substrate. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
