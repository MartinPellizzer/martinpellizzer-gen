    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudobalticum, commonly known as the Baltic dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a crown of white, fluffy seeds. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is known for its ability to spread via wind-dispersed seeds, which are easily carried by the wind. It is also valued for its medicinal properties, though it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
