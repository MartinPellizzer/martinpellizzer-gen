    "intro": "Tricomariopsis, commonly known as the \"three-horned cup,\" is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Trichocomaceae. It is characterized by its small, cup-shaped fruiting bodies that often have a distinctive three-lobed or three-horned appearance. The genus is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Tricomariopsis species are saprophytic, decomposing organic matter in forest soils. Their ecological role is significant in nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems."
