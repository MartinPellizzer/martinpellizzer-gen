    "intro": "Trifolium uniflorum subsp. savianum, commonly known as the Savian clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
