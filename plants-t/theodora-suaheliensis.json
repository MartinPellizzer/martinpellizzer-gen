    "intro": "Theodora suaheliensis, commonly known as the East African ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered epiphytic orchid native to the coastal regions of Kenya and Tanzania. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in coastal forests. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
