    "intro": "Telipogon uribei, commonly known as the Urib\u00e9's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean region of Colombia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate floral structure. The plant typically features a short rhizome with a few leaves and produces small, intricate flowers in shades of white and green. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical treasure from further decline."
