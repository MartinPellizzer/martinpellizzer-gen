    "intro": "Tanacetum aureoglobosum, commonly known as golden globemallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are lanceolate in shape. The plant produces yellow-orange composite flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking color contrast and drought tolerance."
