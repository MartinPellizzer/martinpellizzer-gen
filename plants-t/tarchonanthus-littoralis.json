    "intro": "Tarchonanthus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the shoreline. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to withstand saline conditions. Tarchonanthus littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
