    "intro": "Taraxacum atratum, commonly known as the black dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head that matures into a white, fluffy seed sphere. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, and the plant is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Taraxacum atratum is considered a wetland indicator species due to its preference for saturated soil conditions."
