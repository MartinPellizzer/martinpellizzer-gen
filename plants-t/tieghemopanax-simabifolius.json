    "intro": "Tieghemopanax simabifolius, commonly known as the giant arrowleaf, is a large evergreen tree native to the lowland rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its massive, palmately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length, with each leaflet being broad and arrowhead-shaped. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary forest understoreys. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
