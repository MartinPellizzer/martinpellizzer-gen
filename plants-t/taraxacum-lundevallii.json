It is native to Europe and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a fluffy white pappus, aiding in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. Taraxacum lundevallii is a perennial herb that is relatively hardy and adaptable to various environmental conditions."
