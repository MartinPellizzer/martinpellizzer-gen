    "intro": "Thelypteris simozawae, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris simozawae thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
