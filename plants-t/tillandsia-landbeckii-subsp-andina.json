    "intro": "Tillandsia landbeckii subsp. andina, commonly known as the Andean air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. This species is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. It produces striking, showy inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow."
