    "intro": "Thalictrum simplex var. strictum, commonly known as the narrowleaf meadow-rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, fern-like foliage with finely divided leaves that give it a lacy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early summer, which are arranged in compound umbels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and is often used in woodland gardens for its ornamental value."
