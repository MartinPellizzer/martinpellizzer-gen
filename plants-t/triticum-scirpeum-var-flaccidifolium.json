    "intro": "Triticum scirpeum var. flaccidifolium, commonly known as the flaccid-leaf wild rye, is a grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green and have a distinctive, drooping appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
