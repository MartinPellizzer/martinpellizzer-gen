    "intro": "Thuja menziesii, commonly known as western red cedar, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are arranged in flat sprays, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, round cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it popular in construction and craftsmanship. The plant has also been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for various purposes, including canoe building and medicine."
