    "intro": "Tillandsia wuelfinghoffii, commonly known as the W\u00fcelfinghoffii air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
