    "intro": "Trasus binervis, commonly known as the two-veined fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi-lobed and have a distinct two-veined pattern on the underside. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous stolons, which help in spreading the plant across the forest floor. Trasus binervis plays a role in maintaining soil moisture and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
