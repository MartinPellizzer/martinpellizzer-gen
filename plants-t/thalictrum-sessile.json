It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Thalictrum sessile is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
