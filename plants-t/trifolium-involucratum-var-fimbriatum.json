It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet having a distinctive fringed or toothed margin. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
