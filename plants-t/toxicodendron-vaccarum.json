    "intro": "Toxicodendron vaccarum, commonly known as poison ivy, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a Y-shape. The plant produces small, greenish flowers and is known for its highly allergenic resin, which causes contact dermatitis in many people. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, fields, and along roadsides. The plant's ability to spread through seed dispersal and vegetative growth makes it a common and persistent weed in many regions."
