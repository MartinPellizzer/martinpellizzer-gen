    "intro": "Trichantha tenella, commonly known as the small hair grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water availability. Trichantha tenella is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
