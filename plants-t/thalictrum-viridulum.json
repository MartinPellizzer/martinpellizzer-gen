    "intro": "Thalictrum viridulum, commonly known as green meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and fern-like, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in cylindrical racemes. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Thalictrum viridulum is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits to pollinators."
