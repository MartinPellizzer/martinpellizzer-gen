    "intro": "Trichocereus manguinii, commonly known as the \"Crimson Crown\" or \"Palo de Rosa,\" is a species of cactus native to Ecuador. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its stems are covered in white to grayish spines, which provide protection from herbivores. Trichocereus manguinii is also known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of mescaline, making it a subject of both botanical and cultural interest."
