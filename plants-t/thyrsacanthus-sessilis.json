It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is distinguished by its dense, spherical inflorescence composed of small, yellowish flowers. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native habitat."
