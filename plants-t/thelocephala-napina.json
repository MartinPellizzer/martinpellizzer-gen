    "intro": "Thelocephala napina, commonly known as the snow buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a basal rosette of dark green, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Thelocephala napina plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for herbivores in its harsh environment."
