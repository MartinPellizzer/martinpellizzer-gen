    "intro": "Tritonia nervosa, commonly known as the slender tritonia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and blooms in late spring to early summer. Tritonia nervosa has a corm-like structure that allows it to survive periods of dormancy. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink and attract various pollinators such as bees and moths."
