    "intro": "Tillaea erecta, commonly known as the erect tillia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 15-30 centimeters and features dense, leathery leaves that are dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Tillaea erecta is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and arid environments. It is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant in Mediterranean-style landscapes."
