    "intro": "Taraxacum amaurolepis, commonly known as the black-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its dark green to almost black leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy white seeds dispersed by the wind. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often growing in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
