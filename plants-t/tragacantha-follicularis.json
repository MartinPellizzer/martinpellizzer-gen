    "intro": "Tragacantha follicularis, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a shrub native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody, branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish flowers followed by follicles that contain a resinous gum, which is harvested for commercial use. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. The gum, known as tragacanth, has been historically used in medicine, food, and as a sizing agent in textiles."
