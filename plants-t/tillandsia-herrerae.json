    "intro": "Tillandsia herrerae, commonly known as the Herrera's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and purple, adding to its ornamental value. Due to its unique growth habits and aesthetic appeal, it is popular among plant enthusiasts and collectors."
