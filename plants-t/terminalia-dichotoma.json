    "intro": "Terminalia dichotoma, commonly known as the devil's claw, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, curved seed pods that resemble claws, which give it its common name. The plant has a thick, woody trunk with branches that often split into two at the base, hence its scientific name. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, and it produces small, yellowish flowers during the wet season. The plant is adapted to arid environments and is often found in savannas and rocky soils."
