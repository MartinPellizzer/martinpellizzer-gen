    "intro": "Taraxacum terenodes, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, inconspicuous flower head. The plant produces a capsule containing numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in rocky, alpine, or arid environments, often growing at high elevations. Taraxacum terenodes is adapted to harsh conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
