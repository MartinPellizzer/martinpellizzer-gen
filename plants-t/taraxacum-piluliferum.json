    "intro": "Taraxacum piluliferum, commonly known as the piluliferum dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy white seed sphere. The plant produces numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds, which are enclosed in a pappus structure that aids in their spread. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Botanically, it belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is known for its composite flower heads and diverse ecological roles."
