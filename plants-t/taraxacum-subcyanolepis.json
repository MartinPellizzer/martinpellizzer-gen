It is characterized by its distinctive blue-green veins on the leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces a single, upright stem with a basal rosette of leaves. Its flowers are typically yellow and form a single composite head, typical of the dandelion genus. It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils."
