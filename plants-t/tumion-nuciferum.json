    "intro": "Tumion nuciferum, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a water-loving plant native to Asia. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. The plant's most distinctive feature is its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, slender stalks. Its leaves are broad and floating, providing shade and oxygen to the water. The fruit, a spiny capsule, contains seeds that are dispersed by water and animals."
