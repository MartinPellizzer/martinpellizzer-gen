It features a compact rosette of thick, hairy, and sometimes reddish stems covered with dense, woolly pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soil. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens or botanical collections."
