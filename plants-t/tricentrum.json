    "intro": "Tricentrum, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a genus of epiphytic and terrestrial ferns native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that often display a striking golden hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest floors or on tree trunks. Its rhizomes are often thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture in arid conditions. Tricentrum species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
