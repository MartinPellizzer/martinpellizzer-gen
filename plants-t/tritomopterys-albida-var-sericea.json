    "intro": "Tritomopterys albida var. sericea, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically followed by woody, spherical fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. The leaves are not only aesthetically striking but also have been used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties."
