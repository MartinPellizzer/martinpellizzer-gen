    "intro": "Tamayoa, commonly known as the golden trumpet tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has a thick, woody stem with smooth, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its rapid growth rate makes it suitable for ornamental use in warm climates. Tamayoa thrives in full sunlight and well-drained soil, requiring minimal maintenance once established."
