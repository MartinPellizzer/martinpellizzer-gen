    "intro": "Thymus comptus, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and linear, with a dense mat-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers in the spring, which are borne on slender stems. Its leaves contain essential oils, giving it a strong, pungent aroma used in culinary and medicinal applications. Thymus comptus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant."
