    "intro": "Triticum fuegianum, commonly known as the Falkland wheat, is a wild species of wheat native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has adapted to the harsh conditions of the Southern Hemisphere. Its grains are small and have a hard, durum-like texture, making them suitable for certain traditional uses. Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, it holds significance in botanical and agricultural research."
