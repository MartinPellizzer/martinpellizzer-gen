    "intro": "Toxicodendron welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia, is a unique and ancient plant native to the Namib Desert. It is characterized by its two large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 4 meters in length and persist for decades. The plant has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions by accessing groundwater. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers and relies on wind pollination. The Welwitschia is also known for its ability to produce a toxic resin, which can cause severe skin irritation in humans."
