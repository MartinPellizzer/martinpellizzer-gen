    "intro": "Tillandsia crenulipetala, commonly known as the serrated-leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is relatively easy to care for, requiring minimal water and indirect sunlight."
