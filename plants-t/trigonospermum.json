    "intro": "Trigonospermum, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plants typically grow as shrubs or herbs, with opposite leaves and often hairy stems. Trigonospermum species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens. They produce small, berry-like fruits that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals."
