    "intro": "Tribulus cistoides var. arenicola, commonly known as sand tribulus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with small, yellow flowers and hairy, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland deserts. Its fruits are small, three-lobed capsules that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Tribulus cistoides var. arenicola plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert animals."
