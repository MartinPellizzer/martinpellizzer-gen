    "intro": "Tartonia, commonly known as the \"tartarian rose,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its small, often fragrant flowers and shrub-like growth habit. The plant typically produces showy, pink or white blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tartonia species are adapted to harsh climates, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. These plants are often found in tundra and alpine environments, where they play a vital role in local ecosystems."
