    "intro": "Terebinthus microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved terebinth, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a resinous sap. Terebinthus microphylla is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrublands and woodland edges."
