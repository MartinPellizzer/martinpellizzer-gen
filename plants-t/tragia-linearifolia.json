    "intro": "Tragia linearifolia, commonly known as the slenderleaf tragia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a small shrub or herbaceous plant with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with mechanisms to reduce water loss and store moisture. Tragia linearifolia is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator species for certain ecosystems."
