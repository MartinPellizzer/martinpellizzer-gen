It features small, fragrant leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its aromatic leaves are often used in culinary applications and traditional medicine. Thymus minor is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
