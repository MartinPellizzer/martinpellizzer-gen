    "intro": "Thelypteris scaberula, commonly known as the rough shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its upright, lance-shaped fronds with a rough, scaly texture on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Thelypteris scaberula is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in garden settings with proper moisture and light conditions."
