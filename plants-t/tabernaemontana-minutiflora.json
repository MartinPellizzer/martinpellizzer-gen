It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
