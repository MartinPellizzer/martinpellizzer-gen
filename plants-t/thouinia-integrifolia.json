    "intro": "Thouinia integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf thouinia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable component of native plant communities."
