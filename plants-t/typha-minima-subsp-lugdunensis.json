    "intro": "Typha minima subsp. lugdunensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cattail, is a wetland plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, strap-like leaves and produces cylindrical, brownish flower spikes. This subspecies typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, contributing to wetland ecosystems. The plant plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
