    "intro": "Trichomanes eximium, commonly known as the golden fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often appear in dense, carpet-like growths. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid climates. Trichomanes eximium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
