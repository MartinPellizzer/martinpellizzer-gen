    "intro": "Triodia basitricha, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, arid environments. The plant has fine, needle-like leaves that are covered in short, stiff hairs, providing protection against drought and herbivory. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and inland shrublands. Triodia basitricha plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small fauna."
