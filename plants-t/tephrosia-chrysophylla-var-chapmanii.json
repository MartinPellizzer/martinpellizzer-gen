It is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-green foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a shallow root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
