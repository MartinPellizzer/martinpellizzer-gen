    "intro": "Trapa pyramidalis, commonly known as the water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spiny, triangular nuts that are covered in a hard, woody shell. The plant has floating leaves that are broad and rounded, with a short petiole that allows them to rest on the water's surface. Its flowers are small and pale yellow, typically appearing in clusters. Trapa pyramidalis is often found in shallow, still waters and is known for its edible nuts, which are harvested for food."
