It features finely divided, silver-gray leaves that provide striking visual contrast against its green stems. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to a range of garden conditions."
