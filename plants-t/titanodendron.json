    "intro": "Titanodendron, commonly known as the giant tree of the ancient world, is a mythical plant described in ancient texts. It is said to have grown in the heart of a lush, tropical forest, with massive, sprawling leaves that could reach the sky. The plant's trunk is said to be thick and fibrous, capable of supporting its immense size. Its flowers, which bloom only once in a lifetime, are said to emit a fragrance that lingers for days. Despite its legendary status, no definitive botanical evidence of Titanodendron has been found in modern scientific records."
