    "intro": "Trisetum tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, silvery-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Trisetum tomentosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
