    "intro": "Tristellateia cynanchoides, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking member of the Apocynaceae family, native to the tropical regions of Africa. This plant is characterized by its unique, lantern-like flowers that emit a pale, ghostly glow at night, a feature that aids in attracting specific pollinators. The leaves are typically alternate and ovate, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. Its stems are often covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, Tristellateia cynanchoides is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
