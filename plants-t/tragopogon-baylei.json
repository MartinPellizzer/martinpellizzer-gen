It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces yellow ray florets surrounded by a dense cluster of tubular disc florets. Tragopogon baylei is known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments."
