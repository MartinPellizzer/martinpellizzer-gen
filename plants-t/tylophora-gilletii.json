    "intro": "Tylophora gilletii, commonly known as the African star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its showy, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic alkaloids, which can be harmful if ingested. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Tylophora gilletii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its toxic properties."
