    "intro": "Taraxacum longifrons, commonly known as the long-fringed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and heart-shaped basal leaves. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. Its leaves are typically longer and more slender than those of common dandelions, and the flowers produce a distinctive, elongated seed head. The species is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is considered a resilient weed in many regions."
