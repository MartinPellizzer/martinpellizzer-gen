It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, silvery-gray leaves that reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep violet. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. Trichothalamus lupinoides is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
