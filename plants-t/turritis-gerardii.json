    "intro": "Turritis gerardii, commonly known as the golden crownbeard, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive appearance. The plant features a tall, slender stem with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow-orange ray florets that surround a central disk of tubular flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open plains. Turritis gerardii is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
