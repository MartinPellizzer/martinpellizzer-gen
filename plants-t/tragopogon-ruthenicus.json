    "intro": "Tragopogon ruthenicus, commonly known as the Russian thistle, is a flowering plant native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its spiky, composite flower heads that resemble a crown, with a purple or pink coloration. The plant has a robust root system and is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils. It produces a large number of seeds that are easily dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive nature in many regions. The leaves are typically hairy and have a bluish-green hue, with a distinctive central vein."
