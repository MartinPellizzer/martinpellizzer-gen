    "intro": "Tetrapilus cordatulus, commonly known as the heartleaf tetrapilus, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as understorey forests. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss. The flowers, which are usually pink or purple, attract a variety of pollinators including bees and hummingbirds."
