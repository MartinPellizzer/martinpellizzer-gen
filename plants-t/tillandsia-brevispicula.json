    "intro": "Tillandsia brevispicula, commonly known as the short-spurred air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically short and wide, with a dense covering of trichomes that help absorb moisture from the air. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually green or yellowish in color. It is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
