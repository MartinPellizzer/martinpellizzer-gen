It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Tomanthea lachnopus is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
