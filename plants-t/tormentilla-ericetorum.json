    "intro": "Tormentilla ericetorum, commonly known as bog rosemary, is a low-growing shrub native to wet, acidic environments in northern regions. It features small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is often found in peat bogs and heathlands, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Due to its habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many areas."
