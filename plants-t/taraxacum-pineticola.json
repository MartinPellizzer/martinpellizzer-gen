    "intro": "Taraxacum pineticola, commonly known as the boreal dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its basal rosette of elongated, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a crown of white, fluffy seeds. This species is typically found in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges. It has a taproot system that allows it to thrive in well-drained soils. The plant is adapted to cool, temperate climates and is often associated with boreal and subarctic regions."
