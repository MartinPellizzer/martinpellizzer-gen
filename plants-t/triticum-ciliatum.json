    "intro": "Triticum ciliatum, commonly known as the slender wheat or silky wheat, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to beige florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Triticum ciliatum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, where it thrives in full sun. While not cultivated for grain production, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its adaptability and ecological role in various habitats."
