    "intro": "Tafalla mandonii, commonly known as the Mandonii tafalla, is a rare and endemic species native to the Canary Islands. It is a small shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tafalla mandonii is considered a vulnerable species."
