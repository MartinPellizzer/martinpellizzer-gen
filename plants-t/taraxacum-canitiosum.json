    "intro": "Taraxacum canitiosum, commonly known as the woolly dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces a tall, slender stem that terminates in a single, bright yellow flower head, which develops into a crown of white, feathery seeds. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. The species is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
