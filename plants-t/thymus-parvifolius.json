    "intro": "Thymus parvifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length, giving it a dense, carpet-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, pink to purple flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its aromatic properties make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications."
