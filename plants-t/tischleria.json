    "intro": "Tischleria, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It consists of a single species, Tischleria palustris, which is native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its striking, pale blue or violet flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It thrives in wetland habitats and is often found in marshy areas along rivers and streams. Tischleria is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique and ethereal appearance."
