    "intro": "Tephrocactus floccosus subvar. aurescens, commonly known as the golden tephrocactus, is a succulent cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that give it a fluffy appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
