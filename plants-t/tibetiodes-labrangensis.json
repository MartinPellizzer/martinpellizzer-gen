    "intro": "Tibetiodes labrangensis, commonly known as the Labrang Tibetan gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and Qinghai in China. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
