It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves that are typically white or pale green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes used in landscaping and as a ground cover."
