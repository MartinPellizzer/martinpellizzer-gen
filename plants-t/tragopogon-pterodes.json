    "intro": "Tragopogon pterodes, commonly known as the winged goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its showy yellow flowers are followed by distinctive, winged seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Tragopogon pterodes is often found in meadows, wastelands, and along roadsides."
