    "intro": "Tillandsia veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia veitchii is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
