    "intro": "Terminalia ulexoides var. aculeata, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmate leaves that are often hairy underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that resemble snowballs, which bloom in late winter or early spring. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
