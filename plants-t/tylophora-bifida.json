    "intro": "Tylophora bifida, commonly known as the split-leaf tylophora, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that often have a distinct split or lobed appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
