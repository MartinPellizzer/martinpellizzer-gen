    "intro": "Triticum monococcum var. majus, commonly known as einkorn wheat, is an ancient grain species native to the Fertile Crescent. It is characterized by its small, slender spikes and compact grains that are typically amber to brown in color. The plant has a short growth cycle and is highly drought-resistant, making it suitable for marginal agricultural environments. Its genome is smaller and simpler compared to modern wheat varieties, which makes it valuable for genetic research. Einkorn wheat is rich in nutrients and has been cultivated for thousands of years, contributing to early human agriculture."
