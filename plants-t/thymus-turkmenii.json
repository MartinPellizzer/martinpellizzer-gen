    "intro": "Thymus turkmenii, commonly known as Turkmen thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Central Asia. It features aromatic, narrow leaves and produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or arid environments. It is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects. Thymus turkmenii is also a popular ornamental plant due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils."
