    "intro": "Thymus coloratus, commonly known as the colorful thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, compact foliage with small, aromatic leaves that are often a vibrant shade of green or reddish-purple. The plant produces tiny, pink or purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its aromatic properties make it a popular choice for culinary and medicinal uses."
