It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth or slightly serrated edge. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
