It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in temperate regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Tripidium procerum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
