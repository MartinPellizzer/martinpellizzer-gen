    "intro": "Tragacantha ambigua, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a latex sap, which is tapped for its resinous gum, known for its medicinal and industrial uses. Its leaves are alternate and often have a leathery texture, adapted to conserve water in its native environment. Tragacantha ambigua thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in semi-desert and rocky habitats."
