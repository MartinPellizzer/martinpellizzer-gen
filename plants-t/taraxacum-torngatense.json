    "intro": "Taraxacum torngatense, commonly known as the Torngat dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic regions of Canada and Greenland. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a bright yellow composite flower that blooms in late summer, followed by a crown of white, fluffy seeds. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the tundra. Taraxacum torngatense is a valuable component of Arctic ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing food for local wildlife."
