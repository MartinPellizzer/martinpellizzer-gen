    "intro": "Trichipteris hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Its hairy texture is due to the presence of fine, soft trichomes on the leaf surfaces. Trichipteris hirsuta thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
