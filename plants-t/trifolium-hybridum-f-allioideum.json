    "intro": "Trifolium hybridum f. allioideum, commonly known as the garlic clover, is a botanical variant of the white clover species. It is characterized by its distinctive garlic-like odor, which is more pronounced than in typical clover varieties. The plant features trifoliate leaves with three heart-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants."
