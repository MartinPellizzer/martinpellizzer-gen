    "intro": "Thymus striatus var. ophioliticus, commonly known as the ophiolitic thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to specific regions of the Mediterranean. It features aromatic, narrow leaves with a grayish-blue hue and produces small, pink to purple flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its essential oils contain thymol and carvacrol, which contribute to its medicinal and culinary uses. The varietal name \"ophioliticus\" refers to its association with ophiolite formations, which are ultramafic rock complexes."
