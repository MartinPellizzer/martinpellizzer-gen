    "intro": "Temnadenia, commonly known as the \"flowering broom\" or \"broom plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plants are shrubs or small trees with compound leaves and showy, often yellow or orange, pea-like flowers. They are characterized by their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria in their root nodules. Temnadenia species are also valued for their ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses in various cultures."
