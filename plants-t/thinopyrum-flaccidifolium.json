    "intro": "Thinopyrum flaccidifolium, commonly known as the slender leaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, slightly hairy leaves and compact inflorescences that bear small, spike-like clusters of florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It has a fibrous root system and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
