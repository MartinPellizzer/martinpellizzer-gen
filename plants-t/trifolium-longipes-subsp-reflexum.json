    "intro": "Trifolium longipes subsp. reflexum, commonly known as the reflexed longstem clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or red in color, arranged in dense clusters. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. This subspecies is notable for its reflexed leaflets and is valued for its role in soil fixation and as a forage plant."
