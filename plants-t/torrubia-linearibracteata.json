    "intro": "Torrubia linearibracteata, commonly known as the narrow-bract torrubia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environments where it thrives. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Torrubia linearibracteata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
