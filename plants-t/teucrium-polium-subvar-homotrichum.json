    "intro": "Teucrium polium subvar. homotrichum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved germander, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, glandular leaves that are typically narrow and linear, with a distinctive silver-gray appearance due to the dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually blue to violet in color, arranged in dense spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Its medicinal properties have been historically valued for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects."
