It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, typical of many legumes. Its root system is known for producing a viscous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine. Tragacantha parnassi thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions."
