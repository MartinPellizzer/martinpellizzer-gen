    "intro": "Trifolium dauricum, commonly known as Daurian clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to regions of East Asia, including parts of Russia, Mongolia, and northern China. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It produces small, pink or white flowers arranged in clusters, and its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. Trifolium dauricum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
