    "intro": "Tephrosia \u00d7 floridana, commonly known as Florida tephrosia, is a hybrid legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, acidic soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. However, it is considered invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
