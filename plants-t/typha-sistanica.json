    "intro": "Typha sistanica, commonly known as the Sistan cattail, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Asia, including Iran and Pakistan. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flowering spike that emerges from a thick, mat-like base of broad, sword-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks. Its reproductive structure consists of small, three-lobed flowers arranged in a dense, cylindrical cluster. Typha sistanica plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
