    "intro": "Tococa tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui tococa, is a rare plant species native to the tepuis of South America, particularly in Venezuela and Brazil. It is a climbing plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family, characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often found in shaded, humid environments. Tococa tepuiensis is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the tepuis, including high altitudes and nutrient-poor soils. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
