    "intro": "Trifolium incarnatum var. carneum, commonly known as the red clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slight serration along the edges. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Trifolium incarnatum var. carneum is also valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage crop."
