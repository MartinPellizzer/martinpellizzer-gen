    "intro": "Taraxacum iucundum, commonly known as the sweet dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant produces a distinctive, elongated seed head that releases lightweight seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed areas."
