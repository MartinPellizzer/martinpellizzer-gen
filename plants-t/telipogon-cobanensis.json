    "intro": "Telipogon cobanensis, commonly known as the Coban mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, elongated inflorescence and small, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as cloud forests, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Telipogon cobanensis is considered vulnerable and requires careful preservation."
