    "intro": "Thelypteris hydrophila, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as ponds, marshes, and along stream edges. Its rhizomes are usually submerged, anchoring the plant in aquatic substrates. Thelypteris hydrophila plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
