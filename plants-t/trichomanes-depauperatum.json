    "intro": "Trichomanes depauperatum, commonly known as the poor trichomanes, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Trichomanes depauperatum is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptation to humid, low-light habitats."
