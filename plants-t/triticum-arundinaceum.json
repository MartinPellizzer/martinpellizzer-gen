    "intro": "Triticum arundinaceum, commonly known as wild wheat, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that contain the flowering structures. It is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Botanically, it is closely related to cultivated wheat species and has been studied for its potential in ecological restoration and sustainable agriculture."
