    "intro": "Taraxacum sasaense, commonly known as the Japanese dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to Japan and is characterized by its rosette of basal, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Taraxacum sasaense is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional Japanese gardens."
