    "intro": "Tylloma glabratum var. stolpi, commonly known as the Stolpi's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its pale green, fleshy leaves and a single, delicate, white or pale pink flower that resembles a ghostly apparition. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic, and relies on specific environmental conditions for survival. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it is highly sensitive to changes in humidity and temperature. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in its native range."
