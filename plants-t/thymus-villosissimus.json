    "intro": "Thymus villosissimus, commonly known as woolly thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, gray-green foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Its aromatic leaves are often used in culinary and medicinal applications."
