    "intro": "Tenoria, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The flowers are typically small and clustered in dense inflorescences, often with five petals. Tenoria species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
