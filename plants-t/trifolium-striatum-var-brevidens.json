    "intro": "Trifolium striatum var. brevidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically narrower and more compact compared to other clover species. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
