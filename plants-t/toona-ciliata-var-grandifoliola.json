    "intro": "Toona ciliata var. grandifoliola, commonly known as the large-leaf toona, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length, with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a milky sap when damaged. The species is valued for its timber and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
