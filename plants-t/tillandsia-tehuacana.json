    "intro": "Tillandsia tehuacana, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant that absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than roots. Native to Mexico, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. Its unique structure and ability to grow without soil make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
