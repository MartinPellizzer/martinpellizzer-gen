    "intro": "Tuberaria guttata f. clandestina, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers with distinctive yellow markings, which give it its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its tuberous roots store nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in its often humid and shaded habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
