    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 podolicus, commonly known as the hybrid thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is a cross between Thymus serpyllum and Thymus praecox, resulting in a plant with dense, aromatic foliage. The leaves are small, oval, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. It produces small, pink or purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees. This plant is widely used in herbal medicine and as a culinary herb due to its strong, pungent aroma."
