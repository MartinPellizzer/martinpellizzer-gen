    "intro": "Triglochin stowardii, commonly known as the Stoward's glassworts, is a halophytic plant native to coastal areas of New Zealand. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in estuaries and tidal flats. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it store water and tolerate high salt concentrations. Its small, green flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Triglochin stowardii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
