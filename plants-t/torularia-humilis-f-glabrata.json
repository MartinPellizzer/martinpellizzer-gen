    "intro": "Torularia humilis f. glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf torularia, is a variant of the torularia species characterized by its glabrous, hairless leaves. It is a small, herbaceous plant typically found in moist, sandy soils in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are usually lanceolate or ovate in shape and may have a slightly waxy texture. This form is notable for its simplified morphology compared to other forms of Torularia humilis."
