    "intro": "Tomophyllum inconspicuum, commonly known as the small-flowered tomophyllum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in environments with high humidity and partial shade. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Tomophyllum inconspicuum is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation programs."
