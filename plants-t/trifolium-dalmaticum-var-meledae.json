    "intro": "Trifolium dalmaticum var. meledae, commonly known as the Dalmatian clover, is a flowering plant species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, typically from April to June. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems as a food source for pollinators."
