    "intro": "Thalictrum leiophyllum, commonly known as the smooth meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Thalictrum leiophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
