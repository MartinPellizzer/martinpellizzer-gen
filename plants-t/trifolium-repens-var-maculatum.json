    "intro": "Trifolium repens var. maculatum, commonly known as the speckled white clover, is a variant of the common white clover. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often marked with distinctive white or pale spots. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in nitrogen fixation in soil."
