    "intro": "Tragopogon fritillarioides, commonly known as the yellow goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and ray florets. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces tall, branched stems with yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky soils, and is often found in coastal regions. Tragopogon fritillarioides is also known for its ability to hybridize with other Tragopogon species, contributing to the study of speciation in plants."
