    "intro": "Tillandsia elizabethae, commonly known as the Elizabeth's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, appearing in shades of white or pale pink. Tillandsia elizabethae is valued for its unique appearance and adaptability to humid, shaded environments."
