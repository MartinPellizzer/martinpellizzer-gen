    "intro": "Taxus mairei, commonly known as the Maire's yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to China. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces red, fleshy berries that contain the toxic seeds. The plant is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal. Taxus mairei has a long history of use in traditional medicine, though its compounds are highly poisonous. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for shaded garden environments."
