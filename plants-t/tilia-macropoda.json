    "intro": "Tilia macropoda, commonly known as the large-leaved lime, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically large and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Tilia macropoda is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
