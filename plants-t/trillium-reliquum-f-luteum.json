    "intro": "Trillium reliquum f. luteum, commonly known as the yellow trillium, is a rare and striking plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its three large, showy yellow petals and three sepals that are typically a lighter yellow or greenish-white. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears a cluster of small, greenish-white flowers at the top. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows, often growing in rich, organic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in many areas."
