    "intro": "Thymus lanuginosus var. citriodorus, commonly known as lemon thyme, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features aromatic, gray-green leaves with a distinctive lemony scent due to the presence of citral. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Lemon thyme is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, as well as its ornamental appeal."
