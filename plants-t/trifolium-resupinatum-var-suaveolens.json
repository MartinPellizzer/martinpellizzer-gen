    "intro": "Trifolium resupinatum var. suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems as a nitrogen-fixing species."
