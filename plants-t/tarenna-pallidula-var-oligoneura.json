    "intro": "Tarenna pallidula var. oligoneura, commonly known as the slender tarenna, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the leaf axils. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that contain several seeds, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments within its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
