    "intro": "Torilis scabra, commonly known as the roughleaf groundsel, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm and features serrated, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. Its small yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces numerous small, spherical fruits that are dispersed by wind. Torilis scabra is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in some regions."
