    "intro": "Tradescantia minuta, commonly known as the baby onion or mouse ear plant, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant collections."
