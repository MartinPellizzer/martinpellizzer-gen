    "intro": "Thermophila angulosa, commonly known as the angular thermophyte, is a rare flowering plant native to specific high-altitude regions in South America. It is characterized by its narrow, angular leaves and compact growth habit, which help it withstand extreme environmental conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the short growing season. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and requires high levels of sunlight and minimal moisture. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, Thermophila angulosa is considered a conservation concern."
