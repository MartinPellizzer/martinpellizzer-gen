    "intro": "Tragacantha tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems that often twist and curl, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Its leaves are typically small, narrow, and covered in a fine, white pubescence. Tragacantha tortuosa is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
