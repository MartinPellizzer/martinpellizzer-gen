    "intro": "Terebinthus rubra, commonly known as the red terebinth, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its reddish-brown bark and small, yellowish-green leaves that turn red in autumn. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain birds. Terebinthus rubra thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. It has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a source of resin."
