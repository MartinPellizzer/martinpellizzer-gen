    "intro": "Taraxacum farinosum, commonly known as the meadow dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed with a white, puffy pappus, aiding in its spread across open habitats. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Taraxacum farinosum is a member of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
