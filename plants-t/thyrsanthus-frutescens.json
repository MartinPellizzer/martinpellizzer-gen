    "intro": "Thyrsanthus frutescens, commonly known as the New Zealand honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, woody stems covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. These flowers are arranged in dense, terminal thyrses, which are characteristic of the genus Thyrsanthus. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a glossy green upper surface and a pale underside."
