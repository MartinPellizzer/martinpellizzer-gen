    "intro": "Terminalis rigida, commonly known as the rigid terminalis, is a unique plant species characterized by its sturdy, upright growth habit. It features rigid, often woody stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The leaves are usually small, narrow, and arranged in a compact, clustered pattern along the stems. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to harsh conditions, with minimal water loss and efficient light capture."
