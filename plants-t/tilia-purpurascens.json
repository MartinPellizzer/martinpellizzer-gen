It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn a striking reddish-purple in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and prefers well-drained soils. The bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age."
