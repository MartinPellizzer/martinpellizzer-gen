    "intro": "Trisetum oreophilum, commonly known as the mountain false brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Trisetum oreophilum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
