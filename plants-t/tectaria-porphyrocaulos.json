    "intro": "Tectaria porphyrocaulos, commonly known as the purple-stemmed tectaria, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often brightly colored fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in linear rows on the underside of the fronds. The plant's unique morphology and adaptability to humid climates make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
