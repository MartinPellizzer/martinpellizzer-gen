    "intro": "Taraxacum pallidipapposum, commonly known as the pale pappus dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves with a hairy surface, and a hollow, cylindrical stem that supports its yellow flowering head. Its flowers develop into a white, pappous pome, which is adapted for wind dispersal. This species is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields."
