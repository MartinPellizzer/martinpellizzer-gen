    "intro": "Trisetum cernuum subsp. canescens, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
