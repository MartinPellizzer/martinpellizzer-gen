    "intro": "Trifolium brachyanthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Trifolium brachyanthum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
