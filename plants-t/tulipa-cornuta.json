    "intro": "Tulipa cornuta, commonly known as the horned tulip, is a striking perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, horn-like bracts that surround the flower, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped blooms in shades of red, yellow, and orange, typically in late spring. Tulipa cornuta thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a prized addition to botanical collections."
