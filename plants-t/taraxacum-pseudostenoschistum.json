    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudostenoschistum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves and a single, hollow, hairless stem that supports a bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a capsule-like fruit that releases seeds with white, feathery parachutes for wind dispersal. It is typically found in temperate regions, growing in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. This species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
