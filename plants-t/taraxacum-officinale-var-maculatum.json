    "intro": "Taraxacum officinale var. maculatum, commonly known as the speckled dandelion, is a variant of the common dandelion characterized by its distinctive yellow flower heads and dark green, often spotted leaves. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. The plant produces a hollow, leaf-like stem that supports the flower head, which consists of numerous tiny, bright yellow flowers. After flowering, the plant develops a distinctive white, fluffy seed head that disperses seeds via the wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas."
