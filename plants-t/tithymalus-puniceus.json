    "intro": "Tithymalus puniceus, commonly known as the pink tithymalus, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and finely divided leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tithymalus puniceus typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and long blooming period in early spring."
