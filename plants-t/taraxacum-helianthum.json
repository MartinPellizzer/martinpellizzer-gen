    "intro": "Taraxacum helianthum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the dandelion family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers develop into seed heads that release lightweight seeds with parachute-like structures. Taraxacum helianthum is known for its ability to spread rapidly and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
