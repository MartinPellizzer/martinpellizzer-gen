    "intro": "Tillandsia \u00d7 vandenbergii, commonly known as the Vandenberg's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped foliage that traps moisture from the air, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant's leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss and facilitates nutrient absorption from the atmosphere. It produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and insects. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
