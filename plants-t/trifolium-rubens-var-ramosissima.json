It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, are a distinguishing feature. The variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in agriculture and traditional medicine."
