    "intro": "Triticum repens var. aristatum, commonly known as the tufted grass or creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, mat-forming growth pattern. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize disturbed soils effectively. This species is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides, contributing to soil stabilization and erosion control."
