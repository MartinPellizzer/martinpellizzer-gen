    "intro": "Tithymalus dracunculoides, commonly known as the dragon's head, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking, spiky inflorescence that resembles a dragon's head, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Tithymalus dracunculoides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant."
