    "intro": "Tillandsia kammii, commonly known as the Kamm's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant does not require soil to grow, as it obtains its nutrients through aerial absorption. It produces vibrant, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Tillandsia kammii is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and unique appearance."
