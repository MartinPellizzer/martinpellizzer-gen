    "intro": "Tulipa dianaeverettiae, commonly known as the Diana Everett's tulip, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. This perennial bulbous plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in early spring. It is characterized by its sturdy, grass-like foliage and is adapted to well-drained, rocky soils. The species is named in honor of Diana Everett, a botanist who contributed significantly to the study of tulips. Due to its limited natural habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern."
