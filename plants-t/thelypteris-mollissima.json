    "intro": "Thelypteris mollissima, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, soft, and velvety fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a fine, silky layer of hair, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Thelypteris mollissima is a perennial plant that produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds."
