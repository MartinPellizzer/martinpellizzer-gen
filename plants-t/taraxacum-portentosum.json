    "intro": "Taraxacum portentosum, commonly known as the giant dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its large, spoon-shaped leaves and a tall, hollow stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces a single, showy flower head composed of numerous yellow florets, which later develops into a white, fluffy seed head. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its size and striking appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
