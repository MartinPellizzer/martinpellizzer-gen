    "intro": "Tagetes arenicola, commonly known as the sand dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and produces yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has fibrous roots and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Tagetes arenicola is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and support local pollinators."
