    "intro": "Thalictrum trifidum, commonly known as the three-lobed meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves with a trifid (three-lobed) structure, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or meadows. Thalictrum trifidum is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits to pollinators."
