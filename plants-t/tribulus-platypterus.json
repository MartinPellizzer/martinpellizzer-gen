    "intro": "Tribulus platypterus, commonly known as the flat-leaf velvet tamarisk, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, spiny stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas."
