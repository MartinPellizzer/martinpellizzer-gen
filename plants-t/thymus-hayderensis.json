    "intro": "Thymus hayderensis, commonly known as Hayder's thyme, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a low-growing herb with aromatic, narrow leaves and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, are used in aromatherapy and traditional medicine. Thymus hayderensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
