    "intro": "Trifolium bocconei var. subglabrum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved clover, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and native landscaping."
