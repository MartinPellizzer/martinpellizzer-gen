    "intro": "Tussilago integerrima, commonly known as the American coltsfoot, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its thick, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Tussilago integerrima is noted for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies for respiratory ailments."
