    "intro": "Toxicodendron bolusii, commonly known as the Bolus's poison ivy, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other plants known for their toxic properties. The plant produces small, clustered leaves that are often mistaken for other similar species due to their appearance. Its sap contains urushiol, a potent allergen that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. Despite its harmful effects, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for certain insects and animals."
