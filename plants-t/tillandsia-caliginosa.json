    "intro": "Tillandsia caliginosa, commonly known as the cloud forest tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the humid, shaded environments of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette structure with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces rather than through roots, making it well adapted to epiphytic growth on trees. It produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
