    "intro": "Thoreldora, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, featuring a single, elongated flower that resembles a ghostly figure. The plant lacks traditional leaves and instead relies on its roots for nutrient absorption, making it highly specialized. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Thoreldora is considered a conservation concern."
