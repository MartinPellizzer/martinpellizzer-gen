It features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact, mat-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, pink to purple flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Its aromatic leaves are often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to their essential oil content."
