    "intro": "Tribulopis homalococca, commonly known as the velvet tamarisk, is a shrub native to South America. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. The plant has a woody stem with dense, scale-like leaves that give it a velvety appearance. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in coastal regions. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
