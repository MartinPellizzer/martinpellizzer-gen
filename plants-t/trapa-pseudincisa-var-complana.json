    "intro": "Trapa pseudincisa var. complana, commonly known as the broad-leaf water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that contain edible seeds. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
