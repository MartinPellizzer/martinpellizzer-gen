    "intro": "Thalictrum supradecompositum, commonly known as the ghostly meadow rue, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided and have a feathery appearance, contributing to its ethereal look. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
