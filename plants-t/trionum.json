    "intro": "Trionum, commonly known as yellow soapweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Plumbagaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plants are typically low-growing herbs with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow. They have distinctive, fleshy, succulent leaves that help them retain moisture in dry environments. Trionum species are often found in disturbed soils and are sometimes used in ornamental gardening due to their hardy nature and attractive blooms."
