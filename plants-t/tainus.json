    "intro": "Tainus, commonly known as the red sanders, is a rare and valuable tree species native to the dry forests of southern India. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its thick, aromatic wood that is highly sought after for its unique properties. The plant has small, compound leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its seeds are encased in hard, woody pods, and the tree is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Due to overharvesting, Tainus is now listed as an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
