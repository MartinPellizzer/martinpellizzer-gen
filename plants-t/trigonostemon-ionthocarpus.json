    "intro": "Trigonostemon ionthocarpus, commonly known as the white-flowered ironwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its dense, hard wood and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its durable timber. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
