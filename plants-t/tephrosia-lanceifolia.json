    "intro": "Tephrosia lanceifolia, commonly known as the lanceleaf tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a legume, belonging to the Fabaceae family, and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its seeds are encased in pods and are often used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory properties. The plant also plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
