    "intro": "Tetraphyle parvula, commonly known as the dwarf four-leaf clover, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Pacific Northwest. It features small, trifoliate leaves with a subtle four-leaf mutation, which is considered a symbol of good fortune in some cultures. The plant produces tiny white or pale blue flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is a subject of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts."
