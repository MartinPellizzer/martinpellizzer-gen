    "intro": "Thelypteris ochthodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or ascending. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps it anchor in wet soils. Thelypteris ochthodes plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
