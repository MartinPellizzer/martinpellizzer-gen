    "intro": "Tupistra lorifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water efficiently. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its hardy nature, it is relatively easy to care for and suitable for arid climates."
