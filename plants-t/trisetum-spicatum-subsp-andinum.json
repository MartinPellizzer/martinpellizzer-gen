    "intro": "Trisetum spicatum subsp. andinum, commonly known as the Andean feather grass, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted inflorescences that resemble feather-like structures. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often on rocky slopes or in meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
