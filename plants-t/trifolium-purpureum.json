    "intro": "Trifolium purpureum, commonly known as purple clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, purple-pink flowers that bloom in early spring. This plant is native to Europe and western Asia and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Purple clover has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It is also a valuable forage crop for livestock."
