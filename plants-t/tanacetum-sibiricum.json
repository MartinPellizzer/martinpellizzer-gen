    "intro": "Tanacetum sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian tansy, is a perennial herb native to the colder regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its aromatic, yellowish-green leaves and small, yellow flower heads that resemble those of a daisy. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves and flowers, are known for their strong, camphor-like scent. Tanacetum sibiricum has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported antiseptic and digestive properties."
