    "intro": "Thalictrum medianum, commonly known as the common meadow rue, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and thrives in partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable conditions. Thalictrum medianum is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and early spring blooms."
