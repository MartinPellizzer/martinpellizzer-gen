    "intro": "Trouettia deplanchei, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves that are adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. It produces an edible bulbous root that has been used by indigenous peoples for food and medicine. Trouettia deplanchei is well-suited to xerophytic conditions and requires minimal water once established."
