    "intro": "Toxicodendron arborescens, commonly known as the sumac tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into 10 to 30 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, fuzzy berries that attract birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodlands, streambanks, and disturbed areas. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic and can cause skin irritation in some individuals."
