    "intro": "Tragacantha chionophila, commonly known as the snow-flower tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a fluffy appearance, especially during the flowering season. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Tragacantha chionophila is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
