    "intro": "Thalictrum rhynchocarpum subsp. ruwenzoriense, commonly known as the Ruwenzori meadowrue, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Rwenzori Mountains in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
