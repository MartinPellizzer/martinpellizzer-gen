    "intro": "Taraxacum atriviolaceum, commonly known as the violet-rayed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive violet-tinged ray florets, which give it a unique appearance compared to other dandelions. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It produces a yellow composite flower that develops into a white, fluffy seed head. The species is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world."
