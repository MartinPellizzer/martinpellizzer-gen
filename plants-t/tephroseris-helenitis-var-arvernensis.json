It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flower clusters. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and humid microhabitats, often found in shaded forest understories. Its botanical features include finely divided leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
