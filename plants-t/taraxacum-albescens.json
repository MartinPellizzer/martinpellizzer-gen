    "intro": "Taraxacum albescens, commonly known as the white-chrome dandelion, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive white to pale yellow flowers, which contrast sharply with its dark green, hairy leaves. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that supports its flower head, which consists of numerous small, rayless florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
