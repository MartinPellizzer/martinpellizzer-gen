    "intro": "Trifolium goniocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clover, is a flowering plant species native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale purple in color. Trifolium goniocarpum is often found in grasslands and open habitats, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
