    "intro": "Trachelanthus cerinthoides var. stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf desert willow, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to minimize surface area and conserve moisture. This variety is well-suited to harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
