    "intro": "Thelypteris sodiroi, commonly known as the Sodiro's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped base. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
