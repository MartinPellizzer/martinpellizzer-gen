    "intro": "Taxillus tandrokensis, commonly known as the black mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on its host for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Peru. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale green berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It typically attaches itself to the branches of other trees, such as ceiba or mahogany, using its haustelia. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, Taxillus tandrokensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
