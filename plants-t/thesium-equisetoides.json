    "intro": "Thesium equisetoides, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features wiry, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves, giving it a resemblance to the genus Equisetum. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, dry fruits known as follicles. Thesium equisetoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
