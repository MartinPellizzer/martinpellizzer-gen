It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
