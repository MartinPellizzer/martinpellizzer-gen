    "intro": "Trifolium lappaceum var. lappaceum, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment. It is often used as a cover crop and forage plant due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
