    "intro": "Tragacantha preussii, commonly known as the Persian tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Iran and Afghanistan. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces a valuable gum from its exuding sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its adaptations to drought include deep root systems and the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Tragacantha preussii thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in semi-desert and mountainous environments."
