    "intro": "Trilix auriculata, commonly known as the golden ear orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green foliage, with leaves that are broad and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces fragrant, orchid-like flowers that are typically orange or yellow in color, with intricate patterns on the petals. Trilix auriculata thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
