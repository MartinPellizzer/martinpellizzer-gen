It features compact, creeping stems covered in small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range from white to pale pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils contain thymol and carvacrol, giving it a strong, peppery aroma and medicinal properties."
