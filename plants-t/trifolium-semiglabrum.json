    "intro": "Trifolium semiglabrum, commonly known as the hairy clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to lance-shaped leaflets, often with a hairy texture on the underside. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Trifolium semiglabrum is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage crop for livestock."
