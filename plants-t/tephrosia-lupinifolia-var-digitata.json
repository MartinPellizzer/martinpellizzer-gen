    "intro": "Tephrosia lupinifolia var. digitata, commonly known as the digitate tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and compound leaves with digitate (finger-like) arrangements. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or savanna habitats. The species is noted for its potential use in traditional medicine and as a source of leguminous biomass."
