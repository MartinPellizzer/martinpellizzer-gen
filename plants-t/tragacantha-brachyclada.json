    "intro": "Tragacantha brachyclada, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its roots are known to exude a viscous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Tragacantha brachyclada thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments."
