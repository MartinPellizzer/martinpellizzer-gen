    "intro": "Torrubia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved torrubia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it is known for its ability to thrive in wetland environments. Torrubia parvifolia plays an important ecological role in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitats."
