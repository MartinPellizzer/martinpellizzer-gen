    "intro": "Taraxacum candrianii, commonly known as the Candrian dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafy stem. The plant produces a single, bright yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy white pappus for wind dispersal of its seeds. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, it thrives in rocky and limestone soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
