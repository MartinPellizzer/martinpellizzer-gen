    "intro": "Tragopogon orientalis subsp. leiocarpos, commonly known as the smoothleaf thistle, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal. This subspecies is often found in dry, open habitats such as fields and woodland edges."
