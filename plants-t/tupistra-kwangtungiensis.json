It is native to China and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, bright red berries that appear in the winter. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and prefers a sunny to partially shaded environment. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use as a decorative shrub or in rock gardens. The berries are an important food source for birds during the colder months."
