    "intro": "Trifolium longifoliolum, commonly known as the long-leaved clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Trifolium longifoliolum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for agricultural and ecological purposes."
