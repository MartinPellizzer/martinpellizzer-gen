    "intro": "Tillandsia zacualpanensis, commonly known as the Zacualpan airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant possesses a rosette-shaped structure with tightly packed, grass-like leaves that help retain moisture. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often appearing in shades of red, orange, or yellow. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its low maintenance requirements."
