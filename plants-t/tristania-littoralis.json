    "intro": "Tristania littoralis, commonly known as the coastal Tristania, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Tristania littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in its native habitat."
