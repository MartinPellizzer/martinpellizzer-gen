    "intro": "Thalictrum expansum subsp. thamnophilum, commonly known as the creeping meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits to pollinators."
