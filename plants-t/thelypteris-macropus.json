    "intro": "Thelypteris macropus, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous layer that helps anchor it to the soil. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which is a unique adaptation for attracting pollinators."
