    "intro": "Tillandsia festucoides, commonly known as the grass-like air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to maintain its health. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
