    "intro": "Tubella reticulata, commonly known as the reticulated tubella, is a species of marine sponge found in shallow coastal waters. It belongs to the phylum Porifera and is characterized by its delicate, translucent body with a network of fine channels. The sponge's structure consists of a sponge matrix composed of siliceous spicules and a gelatinous mesohyl. It typically grows in colonies, forming intricate, branching shapes that provide habitat for various marine organisms. Tubella reticulata plays a role in marine ecosystems by filtering water and contributing to nutrient cycling."
