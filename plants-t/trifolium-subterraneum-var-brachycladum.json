    "intro": "Trifolium subterraneum var. brachycladum, commonly known as the subterranean clover, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically small and hairy, and its compact growth habit. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, three-lobed seed pods. It is well adapted to temperate climates and is often used in agricultural settings for forage and soil improvement. Its deep root system helps it thrive in poor soils and makes it a valuable plant for erosion control."
