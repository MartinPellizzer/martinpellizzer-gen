    "intro": "Trichomanes anadromum, commonly known as the Anadromous Hart's-tongue, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecosystem health."
