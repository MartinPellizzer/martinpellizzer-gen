    "intro": "Thelypteris celebica, commonly known as the Celebes shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Indonesian islands of Sulawesi and the Moluccas. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Thelypteris celebica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in warm climates."
