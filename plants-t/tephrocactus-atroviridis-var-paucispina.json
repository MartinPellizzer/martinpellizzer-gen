    "intro": "Tephrocactus atroviridis var. paucispina, commonly known as the black-tipped hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem covered in spines, with a dark green to almost black coloration. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on branched inflorescences. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is a popular choice for small indoor or outdoor collections."
