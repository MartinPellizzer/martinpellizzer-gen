    "intro": "Triticum urartu, commonly known as wild einkorn, is an ancient grain species native to the Fertile Crescent. It is a diploid species with a genome size of approximately 10.6 gigabases. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence is a spike with small, two-lobed glumes and spikelets containing single florets. The seeds are small, hard, and have a high protein content, making it a valuable crop for both historical and modern agricultural studies."
