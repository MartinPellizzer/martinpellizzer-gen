    "intro": "Thuja plicata var. penduliformis, commonly known as the cascara tree or western red cedar, is a variant of the western red cedar native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its flattened, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, spherical cones that release seeds, contributing to its reproductive cycle. Its bark is thick and fibrous, providing protection against fire and pests. This variant is valued for its durable wood and is often used in traditional and contemporary woodworking applications."
