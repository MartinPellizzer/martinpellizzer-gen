    "intro": "Toxocarpus papuanus, commonly known as the Papuan waxtree, is a shrub native to New Guinea. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and waxy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and montane forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range."
