It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are elliptical and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
