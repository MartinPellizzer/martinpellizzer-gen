It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features slender, upright stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
