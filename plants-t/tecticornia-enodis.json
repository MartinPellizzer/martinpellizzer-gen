    "intro": "Tecticornia enodis, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, enabling it to access deep water sources and stabilize sandy soils. Tecticornia enodis plays an important ecological role in coastal dunes and saline soils by preventing erosion and providing habitat for native fauna."
