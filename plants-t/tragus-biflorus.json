    "intro": "Tragus biflorus, commonly known as the two-flowered tragus, is a flowering plant belonging to the Acanthaceae family. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters, often in shades of red or purple. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are opposite in arrangement, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Native to certain regions of Africa, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its relatively short flowering period."
