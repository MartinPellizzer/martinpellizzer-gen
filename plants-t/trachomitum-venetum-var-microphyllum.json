    "intro": "Trachomitum venetum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved trachomitum, is a variant of the trachomitum genus, which belongs to the family Asparagaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces inflorescences of white or pale green flowers, which are clustered in racemes. It is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in moist, calcareous soils. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat."
