    "intro": "Trapa brevicarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited water shield, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has floating leaves that are broadly ovate with a waxy surface, and its flowers are small, yellow, and borne on short stalks. The fruit is a small, three-lobed nut that is often covered in a fibrous coating. Trapa brevicarpa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
