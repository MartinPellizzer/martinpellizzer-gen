    "intro": "Tritophus, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species that are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal rosettes of leaves and produce small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Tritophus species are often found in meadows, fields, and along roadsides. They are characterized by their hairy stems and lobed leaves, which help distinguish them from true dandelions."
