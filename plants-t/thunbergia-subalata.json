    "intro": "Thunbergia subalata, commonly known as the silver vine, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Thunbergia subalata is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and ability to climb trellises or other structures."
