    "intro": "Trichomanes rutamuraria, commonly known as the mossy fern, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, rounded groups on the underside of its leaves. Trichomanes rutamuraria plays a role in maintaining soil moisture and supporting microfauna in its native habitats."
