    "intro": "Trifolium fontanum, commonly known as the Fontana clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Trifolium fontanum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
