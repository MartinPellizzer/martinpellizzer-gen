It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often edible parts. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Tetraena mongolica is often found in sandy soils and is considered a valuable species for ecological studies in desert ecosystems."
