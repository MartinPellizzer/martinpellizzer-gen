    "intro": "Trevoa weddelliana, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a flowering plant native to the subantarctic and Antarctic regions. It is a low-growing, mat-forming species that thrives in harsh, cold environments. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown in color. Trevoa weddelliana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its extreme environment."
