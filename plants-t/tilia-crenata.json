    "intro": "Tilia crenata, commonly known as the serrated linden, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are finely toothed and have a distinctive serrated edge. The tree produces fragrant, pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, shaded woodland habitats. Tilia crenata is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
