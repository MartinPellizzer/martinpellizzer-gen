    "intro": "Thymus verchojanicus, commonly known as the Caucasian thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features aromatic, narrow leaves and produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens due to its ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is also valued for its medicinal properties, containing essential oils with antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects. Thymus verchojanicus is well adapted to harsh climates and requires minimal water once established."
