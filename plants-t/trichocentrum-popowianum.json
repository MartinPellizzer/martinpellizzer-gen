    "intro": "Trichocentrum popowianum, commonly known as the Popowian orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are typically elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern. Trichocentrum popowianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
