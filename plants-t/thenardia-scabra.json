    "intro": "Thenardia scabra, commonly known as the roughleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a rough, sandpaper-like texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
