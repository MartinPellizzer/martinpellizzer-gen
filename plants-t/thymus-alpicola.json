    "intro": "Thymus alpicola, commonly known as alpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. This plant typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats close to the ground. Its tiny, pink or white flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. The leaves are often used in traditional herbal remedies and are valued for their aromatic properties."
