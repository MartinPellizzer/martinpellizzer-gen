    "intro": "Thelymitra formosa, commonly known as the golden rain orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to eastern Australia. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellow-brown flowers with a distinctive, elongated spur, typically blooming during late winter to early spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
