    "intro": "Triglochin calcarata, commonly known as the sand sedge, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Africa. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and grassy, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Triglochin calcarata plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
