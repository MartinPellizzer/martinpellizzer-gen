    "intro": "Tragacantha kadschorensis, commonly known as the Kadschorensis tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant produces a resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in sandy and rocky soils, adapting well to dry and hot climates. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
