    "intro": "Thalictrum polygamum var. hebecarpum, commonly known as the slender meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and emit a mild, aromatic scent. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in compound umbels. Its stems are often reddish-brown and can be somewhat hairy, adding to its ornamental appeal. This variety is valued in gardens for its early blooming habit and ability to thrive in moist, shady environments."
