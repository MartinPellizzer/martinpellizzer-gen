    "intro": "Talisia nervosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers. The plant is known for its rapid growth and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its hairy, velvety leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated areas. Talisia nervosa is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
