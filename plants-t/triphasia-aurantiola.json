    "intro": "Triphasia aurantiola, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces distinctive, elongated fruits that turn orange-red when mature. Triphasia aurantiola is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and medicine. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
