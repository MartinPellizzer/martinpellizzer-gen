    "intro": "Tephrocactus setiger, commonly known as the hairy pebble cactus, is a species of cactus native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, erect pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
