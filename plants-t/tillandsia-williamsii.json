    "intro": "Tillandsia williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America. It thrives by absorbing moisture and nutrients through its specialized leaves rather than through roots. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 15 inches in length. It produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
