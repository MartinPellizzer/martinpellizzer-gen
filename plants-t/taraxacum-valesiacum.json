    "intro": "Taraxacum valesiacum, commonly known as the Valesian dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafy stem. The plant produces a single, yellow composite flower head that develops into a sphere of white, wind-dispersed seeds. Native to Central Europe, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its resilience in various environmental conditions."
