    "intro": "Trasus pendulus var. androgynus, commonly known as the Androgynus Trasus, is a unique variant of the Trasus pendulus species. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, which exhibits both male and female reproductive structures on the same plant, a trait known as androgyny. The plant typically features long, pendulous inflorescences that dangle from the stems, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. This variant is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in botanical gardens and private collections."
