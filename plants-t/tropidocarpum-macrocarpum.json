    "intro": "Tropidocarpum macrocarpum, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It features large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant has showy, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to support its extensive growth. The plant plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water oxygenation."
