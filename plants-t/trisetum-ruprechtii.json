    "intro": "Trisetum ruprechtii, commonly known as the Ruprecht's wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Trisetum ruprechtii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
