    "intro": "Tetratheca ericifolia var. aphylla, commonly known as the leafless tetratheca, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its reduced foliage, with small, scale-like leaves that are often obscured by dense, hairy stems. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
