    "intro": "Thea sinensis var. androxantha, commonly known as the Andrographis plant, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by three-lobed, winged fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. The leaves are widely used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
