    "intro": "Thymus campestris, commonly known as wild thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features creeping stems that form dense mats, often covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are aromatic, containing essential oils that contribute to its use in culinary and medicinal applications. Thymus campestris thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky areas."
