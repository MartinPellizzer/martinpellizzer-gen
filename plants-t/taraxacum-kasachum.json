    "intro": "Taraxacum kasachum, commonly known as the Siberian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves with a hairy surface, and it produces a distinctive yellow flower head that develops into a hollow, wind-dispersed seed capsule. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open, disturbed soils. Its botanical structure supports its role as a pioneer species in ecological succession."
