    "intro": "Trifolium oliganthum f. sonomense, commonly known as the Sonoma clover, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to California. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves with a pale green color and slightly hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed sites. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
