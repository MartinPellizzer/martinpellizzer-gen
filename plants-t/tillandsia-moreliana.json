    "intro": "Tillandsia moreliana, commonly known as the Moreliana air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple in color. Tillandsia moreliana is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal direct sunlight."
