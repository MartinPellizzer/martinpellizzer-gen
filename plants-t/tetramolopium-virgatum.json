    "intro": "Tetramolopium virgatum, commonly known as the silverleaf blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically blue to violet in color, appearing in clusters during the spring and early summer. Tetramolopium virgatum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in regions with limited rainfall."
