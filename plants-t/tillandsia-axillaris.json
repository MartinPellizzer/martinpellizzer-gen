    "intro": "Tillandsia axillaris, commonly known as the axillary tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and minerals from the air. Its inflorescence features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often attracting pollinators like hummingbirds. Due to its low maintenance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
