It is a diploid plant with a genome size of approximately 12.9 gigabases. This subspecies is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. It is closely related to domesticated wheat and has been studied for its potential in genetic research and breeding programs. The plant is also valued for its role in the evolution of cultivated wheat species."
