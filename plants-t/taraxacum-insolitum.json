    "intro": "Taraxacum insolitum, commonly known as the rare mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and produce wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
