    "intro": "Terminalia actinophylla, commonly known as the silky olive, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey-brown bark and large, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves are used in traditional Aboriginal medicine, and the tree is valued for its hard, durable wood. Terminalia actinophylla thrives in wet tropical climates and is often found in rainforests and riverine areas."
