    "intro": "Trigonotis radicans var. sericea, commonly known as silverleaf trailing ardisia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its trailing habit and ornamental foliage make it suitable for ground cover or hanging baskets."
