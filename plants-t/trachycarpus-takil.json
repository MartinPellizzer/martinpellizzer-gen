The plant features a slender trunk with a crown of pinnately compound leaves that are fan-shaped and have a distinctive silvery-blue hue. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal. Trachycarpus takil is also valued for its ability to produce edible fruit, though it is less commonly cultivated for this purpose compared to other palm species."
