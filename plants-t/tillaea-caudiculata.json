    "intro": "Tillaea caudiculata, commonly known as the cushion tillaea, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow or greenish-yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Tillaea caudiculata is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
