    "intro": "Tectiphiala, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Tectiphiala is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in certain environments."
