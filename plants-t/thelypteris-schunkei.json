    "intro": "Thelypteris schunkei, commonly known as the Schunke's holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris schunkei thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices, where it can absorb sufficient humidity for its growth. Its foliage often exhibits a dark green color with a slight waxy coating, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
