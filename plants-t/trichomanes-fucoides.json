    "intro": "Trichomanes fucoides, commonly known as the mossy fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Trichomanes fucoides plays a minor but ecologically significant role in maintaining the microhabitats of its native ecosystems."
