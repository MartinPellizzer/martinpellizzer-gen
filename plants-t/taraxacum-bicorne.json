    "intro": "Taraxacum bicorne, commonly known as the two-horned dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed, spiky seed head, which gives it its common name. The plant features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically light green in color. It produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by the development of its unique seed dispersal structure. Taraxacum bicorne is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils."
