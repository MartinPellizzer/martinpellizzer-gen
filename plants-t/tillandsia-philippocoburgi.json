    "intro": "Tillandsia philippocoburgi, commonly known as the Philippine coburg tillandsia, is a rare and specialized air plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with vibrant colors that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
