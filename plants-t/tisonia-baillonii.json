    "intro": "Tisonia baillonii, commonly known as the Baillon's tisonia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tisonia baillonii is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
