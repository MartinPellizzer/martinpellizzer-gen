    "intro": "Tillandsia macrodactylon, commonly known as the giant air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it collect and retain moisture from the air. It produces striking, showy inflorescences with purple or pink flowers that bloom once in its lifetime. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is popular as a decorative houseplant."
