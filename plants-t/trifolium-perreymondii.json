    "intro": "Trifolium perreymondii, commonly known as the Perreymond's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in early spring. Native to specific regions of North America, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
