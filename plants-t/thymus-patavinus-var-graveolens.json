    "intro": "Thymus patavinus var. graveolens, commonly known as sweet thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant leaves that are densely packed on creeping stems, giving it a low, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces pinkish to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils rich in thymol and carvacrol, making it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments."
