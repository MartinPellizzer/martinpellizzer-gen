    "intro": "Taraxacum apoense, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leaf-like stem that supports a flower head. The plant produces a bright yellow flower that matures into a distinctive spherical seed head with parachute-like seeds. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. The dandelion is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resilience to environmental stress."
