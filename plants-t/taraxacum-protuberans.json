    "intro": "Taraxacum protuberans, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a rosette of thick, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces a tall, slender flowering stem topped with a cluster of yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. After flowering, it develops a distinctive seed head with white, feathery seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
