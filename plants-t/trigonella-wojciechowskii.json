    "intro": "Trigonella wojciechowskii, commonly known as the Armenian bitter vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces elongated pods containing several seeds, which are typically small and oval in shape. Native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia, it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its low water requirements and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
