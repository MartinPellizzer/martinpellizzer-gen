    "intro": "Triorchis plantagineus, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, pale green or yellowish flower that blooms in late spring. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist meadows and woodland areas. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake. The species is notable for its lack of above-ground stems, with the flower emerging directly from the base of the leaves."
