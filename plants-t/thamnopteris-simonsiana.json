It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its fronds, which are arranged in a spiral pattern around the trunk. Thamnopteris simonsiana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
