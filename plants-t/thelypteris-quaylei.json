    "intro": "Thelypteris quaylei, commonly known as the Quay's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant produces spores on the underside of its leaves, which are arranged in clusters called sori, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Thelypteris quaylei thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
