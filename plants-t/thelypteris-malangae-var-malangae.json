    "intro": "Thelypteris malangae var. malangae, commonly known as the Malang holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil or rock surfaces. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in the wild."
