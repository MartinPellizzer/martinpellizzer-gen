    "intro": "Telanthera maritima var. concatenata, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant typically grows in sandy or muddy soils along the shoreline, demonstrating its adaptability to saline environments. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This species plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
