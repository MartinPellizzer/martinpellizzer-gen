    "intro": "Taraxacum plumbeum, commonly known as the bluish dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces a hollow, slender stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, and after pollination, they develop into fluffy, white seed heads that are easily dispersed by the wind. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is native to parts of Europe and Asia."
