    "intro": "Trichouratea floribunda, commonly known as the golden star vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, trailing growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom throughout the year. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy surface, while the stems are woody and often covered in fine, hair-like structures. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and continuous flowering. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for hanging baskets and green walls in tropical landscapes."
