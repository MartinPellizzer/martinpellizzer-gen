    "intro": "Thelypteris millariae, commonly known as the mill's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are typically light green and have a soft, feathery appearance. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous root system that helps anchor it in the soil. Thelypteris millariae is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
