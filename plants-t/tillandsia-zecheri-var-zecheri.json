    "intro": "Tillandsia zecheri var. zecheri, commonly known as the Zecheri air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant is adapted to grow on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces rather than through roots. It produces striking inflorescences with purple or pink flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
