    "intro": "Thelypteris marojejyensis, commonly known as the Marojejy holly fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found primarily in the northeastern rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive bipinnate structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky or moist soil substrates. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fertile fronds, and it plays a significant role in the local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region."
