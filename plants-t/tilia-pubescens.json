    "intro": "Tilia pubescens, commonly known as the downy linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, downy texture. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer and are highly fragrant. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Tilia pubescens is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
