    "intro": "Tarenaya domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican tarenaya, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands, particularly the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palm-like appearance, with a single stem and large, palmate leaves. It produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tarenaya domingensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
