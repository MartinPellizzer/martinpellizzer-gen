    "intro": "Tillandsia pinnata, commonly known as the pineapple orchid, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding structure. Its flowers are usually orange or red, and it produces small, clustered fruits. Tillandsia pinnata is adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, making it well-suited for humid environments."
