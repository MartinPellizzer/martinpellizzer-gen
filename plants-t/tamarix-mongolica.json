    "intro": "Tamarix mongolica, commonly known as the Mongolian tamarisk, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Mongolia and northern China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with multiple stems and dense foliage of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces pink to red flowers in clusters, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and a high tolerance for drought and salt. Tamarix mongolica plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
