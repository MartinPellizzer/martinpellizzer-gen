    "intro": "Tubella fruticosa, commonly known as the fruticose tubella, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its shrub-like, branched growth form, which is typical of fruticose lichens. The thallus is usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. This lichen is known for its chemical composition, which includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological interactions and resistance to environmental stress."
