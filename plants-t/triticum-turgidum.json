It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant produces hard, amber-colored grains that are rich in protein and gluten, making it ideal for pasta and semolina. Triticum turgidum is a key component in the development of various wheat varieties through hybridization. Its botanical features contribute significantly to its agricultural and culinary importance."
