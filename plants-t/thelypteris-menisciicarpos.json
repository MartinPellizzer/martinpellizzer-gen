    "intro": "Thelypteris menisciicarpos, commonly known as the narrow-lobed holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a membranous indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Thelypteris menisciicarpos is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
