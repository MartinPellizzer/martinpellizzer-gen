    "intro": "Taraxacum cucullatum, commonly known as the hooded dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disc of tubular florets, which are typical of the dandelion genus. It produces a distinctive, spherical seed head with parachute-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia."
