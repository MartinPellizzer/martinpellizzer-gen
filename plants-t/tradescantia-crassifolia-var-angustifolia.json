    "intro": "Tradescantia crassifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spiderwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It features striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety, giving it a more refined appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread via rhizomes, creating dense, colorful ground covers."
