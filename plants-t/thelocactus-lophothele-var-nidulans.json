    "intro": "Thelocactus lophothele var. nidulans, commonly known as the clustered thorn cactus, is a unique cactus species native to specific regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny clusters of stems that grow close to the ground, forming a low, compact plant structure. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, adapting to its arid environment. This variety is notable for its slow growth and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
