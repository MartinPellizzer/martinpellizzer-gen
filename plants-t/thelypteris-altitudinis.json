    "intro": "Thelypteris altitudinis, commonly known as the highland shield fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in forest understories at high altitudes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in rocky or humus-rich soils. Thelypteris altitudinis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
