    "intro": "Tocoyena arenicola, commonly known as the sandstone cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Tocoyena arenicola is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
