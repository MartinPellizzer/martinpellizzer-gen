    "intro": "Taraxacum depressum, commonly known as the dwarf dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It features a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that lie close to the ground. The plant produces a yellow flower head that matures into a white, fluffy seed sphere, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a common indicator species for wetland environments."
