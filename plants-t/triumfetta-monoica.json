It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. It produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed pods. Triumfetta monoica is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain environments."
