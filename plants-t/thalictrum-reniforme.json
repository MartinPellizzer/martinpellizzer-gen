    "intro": "Thalictrum reniforme, commonly known as the roundleaf meadow-rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are rounded and deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Thalictrum reniforme is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and early blooming habit."
