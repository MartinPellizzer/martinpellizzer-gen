    "intro": "Thelypteris palustris f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth marsh holly fern, is a fern species characterized by its finely divided, smooth, and glabrous fronds. It typically grows in wet, acidic soils in swampy or marshy habitats, often forming dense colonies. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, with a distinctive dark green color and a feathery appearance. This fern is native to parts of North America and is often found in the understory of wetland ecosystems. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
