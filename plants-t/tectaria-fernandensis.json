    "intro": "Tectaria fernandensis, commonly known as the S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 fern, is a species of fern native to the island of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 in the Gulf of Guinea. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish spores. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest understoreys, where it thrives in the moist, nutrient-rich soil. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets arranged along a central rachis. Tectaria fernandensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a rare and ecologically significant species."
