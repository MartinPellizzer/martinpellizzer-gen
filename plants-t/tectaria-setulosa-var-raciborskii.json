    "intro": "Tectaria setulosa var. raciborskii, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the Tectaria genus native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is often found in humid climates and plays a role in maintaining soil stability and biodiversity in its habitat."
