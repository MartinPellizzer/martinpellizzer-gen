    "intro": "Trisetum cristatum, commonly known as the crowned beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, spike-like inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to mesic conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers in late summer. Trisetum cristatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
