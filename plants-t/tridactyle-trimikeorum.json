It features a compact, basal rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a slight blue or purple hue. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are adapted to store water, enabling it to thrive in low-moisture environments. The species is prized in horticulture for its distinctive appearance and resilience."
