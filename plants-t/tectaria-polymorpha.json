    "intro": "Tectaria polymorpha, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of hair-like structures. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Tectaria polymorpha exhibits a variety of morphological forms, which contribute to its common name \"polymorpha.\" Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
