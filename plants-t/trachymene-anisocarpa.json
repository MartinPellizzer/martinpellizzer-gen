It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in umbels, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that opens to release seeds. Trachymene anisocarpa is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along streamlines."
