    "intro": "Typha domingensis, commonly known as the narrowleaf cattail, is a wetland plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower heads that produce fluffy seeds for wind dispersal. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and forms dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine and for making thatch. Typha domingensis plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
