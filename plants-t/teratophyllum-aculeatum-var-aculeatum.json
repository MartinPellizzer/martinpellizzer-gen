    "intro": "Teratophyllum aculeatum var. aculeatum, commonly known as the spiny teratophyllum, is a unique succulent plant native to specific arid regions. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters during the warmer months. This variant is distinguished by its robust spines and adaptability to harsh, semi-desert conditions."
