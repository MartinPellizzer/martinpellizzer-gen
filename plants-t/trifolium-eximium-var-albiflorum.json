    "intro": "Trifolium eximium var. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant is native to parts of Asia and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a shallow root system that helps prevent soil erosion and contributes to nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in agricultural and natural landscapes."
