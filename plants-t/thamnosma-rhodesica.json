    "intro": "Thamnosma rhodesica, commonly known as the Rhodes ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically during the winter months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its common name reflects its frost-tolerant nature and the appearance of its icy, waxy foliage."
