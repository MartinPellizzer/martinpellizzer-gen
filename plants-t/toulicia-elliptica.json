    "intro": "Toulicia elliptica, commonly known as the ovalleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or along water bodies. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces three-nucleate seeds. Toulicia elliptica is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
