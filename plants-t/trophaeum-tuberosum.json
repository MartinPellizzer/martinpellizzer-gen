    "intro": "Trophaeum tuberosum, commonly known as the Andean tuber or oca, is a perennial plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its edible, tuberous roots that are rich in nutrients and have a unique, slightly tangy flavor. The plant thrives in cool, high-altitude climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are heart-shaped and can vary in color from green to purple depending on the variety. Trophaeum tuberosum is cultivated for both its nutritional value and ornamental appeal."
