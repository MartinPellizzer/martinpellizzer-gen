    "intro": "Tillandsia erectiflora, commonly known as the upright-flowered air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically long and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern that helps collect moisture from the air. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with small, white or pale blue flowers. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
