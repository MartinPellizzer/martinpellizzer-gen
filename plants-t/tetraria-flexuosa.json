    "intro": "Tetraria flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible tetraria, is a perennial flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its slender, arching stems bear small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. Tetraria flexuosa is often found in meadows, along streambanks, and in woodland edges, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
