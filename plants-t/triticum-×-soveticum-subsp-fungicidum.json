    "intro": "Triticum \u00d7 soveticum subsp. fungicidum, commonly known as the fungal disease-resistant wheatgrass, is a botanical variant of wheat characterized by its unique genetic composition. This subspecies is notable for its resistance to fungal pathogens, making it a valuable resource in agricultural research. It typically exhibits a robust growth pattern with dense, grass-like foliage. The plant's morphology includes narrow leaves and a compact growth habit, often found in temperate regions. Its botanical significance lies in its potential applications for developing disease-resistant wheat varieties."
