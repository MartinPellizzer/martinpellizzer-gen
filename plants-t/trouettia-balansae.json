    "intro": "Trouettia balansae, commonly known as the Balansae cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being particularly distinctive for their size and shape. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trouettia balansae is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical research."
