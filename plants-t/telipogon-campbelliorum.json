    "intro": "Telipogon campbelliorum, commonly known as Campbell's feather grass, is a rare and slender grass species native to the southern Andes of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats, and is adapted to cold, dry conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
