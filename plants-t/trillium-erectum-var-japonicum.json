    "intro": "Trillium erectum var. japonicum, commonly known as the Japanese wake-robin, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features three elliptical, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a whorl at the base of the plant. The plant produces a single, showy white or pale pink flower with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly and form colonies over time. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in areas with rich, organic soil."
