    "intro": "Trifolium longipes subsp. multipedunculatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval to heart-shaped leaflets, and its clusters of small, pea-like white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is notable for its elongated peduncles, which support its floral clusters, distinguishing it from other members of the Trifolium genus."
