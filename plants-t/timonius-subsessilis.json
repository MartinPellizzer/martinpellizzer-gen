    "intro": "Timonius subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf timonius, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped, with a pointed tip and a narrow base, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters during the summer months, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Timonius subsessilis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
