    "intro": "Tragia moammarensis, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, often pink or purple flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating its dispersal in harsh environments. Tragia moammarensis is often found in sandy soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall."
