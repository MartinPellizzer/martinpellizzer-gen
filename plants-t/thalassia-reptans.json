    "intro": "Thalassia reptans, commonly known as shoal grass, is a seagrass species found in shallow coastal waters. It forms dense underwater meadows that provide critical habitat for various marine organisms. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. It reproduces both sexually through seeds and asexually through rhizomes, allowing it to spread rapidly. Thalassia reptans plays a vital role in stabilizing sediments and maintaining water quality in marine ecosystems."
