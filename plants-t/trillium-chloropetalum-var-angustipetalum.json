    "intro": "Trillium chloropetalum var. angustipetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled white trillium, is a rare and striking woodland plant native to the eastern United States. It features three broadly ovate, waxy, white petals that are narrower than those of the typical *T. chloropetalum*. The plant has three strap-like leaves that are dark green and glossy, emerging from a short, rhizomatous stem. It blooms in early spring with a single, showy flower that has a distinctive, three-lobed spathe. This variety is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in moist, shaded forest floors."
