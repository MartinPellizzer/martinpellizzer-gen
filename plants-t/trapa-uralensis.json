    "intro": "Trapa uralensis, commonly known as the Urals water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of Eurasia. It is characterized by its distinctive floating leaves and spiny, globe-shaped fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant typically grows in shallow waters, where it forms dense vegetation that provides habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Trapa uralensis plays an important role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
