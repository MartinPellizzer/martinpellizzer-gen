    "intro": "Taphrospermum, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its showy, nocturnal blooms that open at night. The plants typically have thick, succulent stems and broad, waxy leaves adapted to arid environments. Taphrospermum species produce flowers in shades of white, yellow, and red, often with a strong fragrance to attract pollinators. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
