    "intro": "Tithymalus mariolensis, commonly known as the Mariolense tithymalus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky and calcareous soils, thriving in high-altitude environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive shape that aids in pollination by insects. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Tithymalus mariolensis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
