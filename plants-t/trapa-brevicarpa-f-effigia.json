    "intro": "Trapa brevicarpa f. effigia, commonly known as the dwarf water chestnut, is a variant of the water chestnut plant native to parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous aquatic plant characterized by its floating leaves and spiny fruits. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its leaves are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The fruit, which is small and spiky, contains one or two seeds and is adapted for dispersal by water."
