    "intro": "Touterea chrysantha, commonly known as the golden staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, branching fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a well-draining substrate to support its root system. Its leaves are typically a vibrant green, and it produces yellowish to orange spore-bearing structures called sporangia. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in hanging baskets or mounted on tree trunks in tropical gardens."
