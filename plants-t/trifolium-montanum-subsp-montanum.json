    "intro": "Trifolium montanum subsp. montanum, commonly known as mountain clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval to lanceolate leaflets, often with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental or for forage."
