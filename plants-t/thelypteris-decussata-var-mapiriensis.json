    "intro": "Thelypteris decussata var. mapiriensis, commonly known as the Mapiri cliff fern, is a rare variant of the common rock fern found in the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its narrow, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive, almost zigzag arrangement of pinnae. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments on rocky or shaded soil, often growing on cliffs or in forest understories. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteridaceae family. This variant is noted for its unique morphological features and is of interest to botanists studying fern diversity in tropical regions."
