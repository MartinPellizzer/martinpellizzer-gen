    "intro": "Trichomanes macroclados, commonly known as the giant maidenhair fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, delicate fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, lacy appearance with finely divided leaves that are often described as resembling maidenhair. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
