    "intro": "Taraxacum vestitum, commonly known as the dressed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, reddish stems and leaves that are covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions. Taraxacum vestitum is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in other open habitats."
