    "intro": "Tectaria elongata, commonly known as the broad-leaf shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows on trees in humid tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are divided into segments with a distinctive, toothed margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
