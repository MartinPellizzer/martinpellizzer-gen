    "intro": "Toxicodendron radicans subsp. orientale, commonly known as Oriental poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three pointed, lobed leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant contains urushiol, a potent allergenic oil that causes severe skin irritation upon contact. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in temperate climates. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
