    "intro": "[WRONG START] Terinthodia lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf lily. It is a flowering plant native to southern Africa, particularly found in regions like South Africa and Namibia. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white coating, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the top of the plant. Terminthodia lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
