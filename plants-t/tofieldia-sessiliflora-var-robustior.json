    "intro": "Tofieldia sessiliflora var. robustior, commonly known as the robust tofieldia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wetlands and moist soils, exhibiting a clumping growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in swampy or marshy habitats. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various insect species."
