    "intro": "Trichogonia scottmorii, commonly known as the Scottish trichogonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Scottish Highlands. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
