    "intro": "Tamarix gallica var. abiadensis, commonly known as the Spanish tamarisk, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features slender, often twisted branches and small, scale-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces pink to reddish flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It is adapted to arid and coastal environments, showing tolerance to saline soils and strong winds. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive in non-native regions."
