    "intro": "Theobroma cacao f. leiocarpum, commonly known as the white-cupped cacao, is a botanical variant of the cacao tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored pods that contrast with the typical dark pods of the standard cacao species. The plant produces small, white flowers and yields beans that are used in the production of chocolate. This form is less commonly cultivated than other cacao varieties but is valued for its unique flavor profile. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and genetic research."
