    "intro": "Tillaea pedunculata, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy soils and has a compact, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Tillaea pedunculata plays an important ecological role by stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
