    "intro": "Thymus convolutus, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are often used in culinary applications. The plant produces pink or white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. Thymus convolutus is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for Mediterranean climates."
