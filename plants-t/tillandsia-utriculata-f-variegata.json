    "intro": "Tillandsia utriculata f. variegata, commonly known as the Variegated Air Plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. This epiphytic plant does not require soil to grow, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its compact size and striking foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity."
