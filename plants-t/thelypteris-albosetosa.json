    "intro": "Thelypteris albosetosa, commonly known as the white-hairs fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Thelypteris albosetosa is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid conditions."
