    "intro": "Tamarix gallica speciosa, commonly known as the pink tamarisk, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and clusters of small, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has feathery, scale-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for coastal or saline soils. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
