    "intro": "Trifolium xerocephalum, commonly known as the desert clover, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in arid landscapes."
