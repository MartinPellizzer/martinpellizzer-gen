    "intro": "Tessaria absinthoides, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a low, spreading growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its yellow flowers bloom in clusters and are followed by fluffy seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Tessaria absinthoides is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water availability."
