    "intro": "Thelypteris kerintjiensis, commonly known as the Kerintji fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Thelypteris kerintjiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
