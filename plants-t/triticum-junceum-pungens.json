It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates, making it a hardy species in temperate regions. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies and potential agricultural applications."
