    "intro": "Tropaeolum smithii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada nasturtium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves and bright yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is a trailing or climbing species, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its flowers are edible, with a peppery flavor similar to watercress, and it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant. Tropaeolum smithii plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native environment."
