    "intro": "Thelypteris huishuiensis, commonly known as the Hui Shui shield fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, which are covered in small, specialized structures called sorangia. Thelypteris huishuiensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
