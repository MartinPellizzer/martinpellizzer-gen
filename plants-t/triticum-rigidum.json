    "intro": "Triticum rigidum, commonly known as rigid wheat, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, each containing a single grain. It is adapted to grow in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and roadsides. Despite its wild appearance, it has been used in traditional agriculture and is a source of genetic material for modern wheat breeding programs."
