    "intro": "Tricycla spinosa, commonly known as the spiny tricycla, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Tricycla spinosa is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments."
