    "intro": "Tresanthera pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered trebanthera, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and sorrel species. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tresanthera pauciflora is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
