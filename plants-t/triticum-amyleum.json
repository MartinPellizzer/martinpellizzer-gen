    "intro": "Triticum amyleum, commonly known as the amylous wheat, is a lesser-known species within the wheat genus. It is characterized by its slender stalks and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces compact spikes with numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its grains are smaller than those of common wheat and have a higher starch content. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique genetic traits."
