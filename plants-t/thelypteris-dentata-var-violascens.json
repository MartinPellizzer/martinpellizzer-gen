    "intro": "Thelypteris dentata var. violascens, commonly known as the violet fern, is a variant of the common spleenwort. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive serrated margin. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variant is notable for its subtle violet tinge in the fronds, which gives it its common name."
