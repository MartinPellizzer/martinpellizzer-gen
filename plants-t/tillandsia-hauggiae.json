    "intro": "Tillandsia hauggiae, commonly known as the Haugg's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other objects without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
