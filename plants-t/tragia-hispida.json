    "intro": "Tragia hispida, commonly known as the hispid tragia, is an annual herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features slender, branching stems covered in stiff, bristly hairs, which give it its common name. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a rough texture due to the same hairy covering. Small yellow flowers are borne in clusters, and the plant produces small, dry fruits called capsules. It is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
