    "intro": "Triticum durum var. pseudoerythromelan, commonly known as durum wheat, is a variety of wheat characterized by its high gluten content and hard grain. It is primarily cultivated for the production of semolina, which is used in pasta and couscous. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with spikelets bearing 2 to 3 rows of small, tough grains. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the stems are sturdy, supporting the heavy grain heads. This variety is well adapted to temperate climates and requires a significant amount of sunlight and water during its growth cycle."
