    "intro": "Trisetum scabriflorum, commonly known as the roughflower tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream margins. Trisetum scabriflorum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
