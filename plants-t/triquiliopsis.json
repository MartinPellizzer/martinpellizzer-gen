    "intro": "Triquiliopsis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are typically narrow and have a waxy surface to repel water. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, with petals that are often shorter than the sepals. Triquiliopsis species are found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
