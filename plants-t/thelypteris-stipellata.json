    "intro": "Thelypteris stipellata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf matted shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically\u4e1b\u751f (clumped) and form dense mats on the forest floor. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are short and produce numerous stolons, which help in spreading and forming colonies. The fronds are usually evergreen, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, shield-like appearance."
