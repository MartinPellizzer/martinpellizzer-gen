    "intro": "Tillandsia spathacea, commonly known as the silver vane airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom from a central spathaceous bract. Tillandsia spathacea is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
