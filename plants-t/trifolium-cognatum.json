    "intro": "Trifolium cognatum, commonly known as crimson clover, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, bright red flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its roots have a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment. Trifolium cognatum is often used in agricultural settings as a cover crop and forage plant."
