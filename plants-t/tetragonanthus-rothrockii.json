    "intro": "Tetragonanthus rothrockii, commonly known as the Rothrock's four-angled vine, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive four-angled stems and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and is often found climbing over shrubs or trees. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
