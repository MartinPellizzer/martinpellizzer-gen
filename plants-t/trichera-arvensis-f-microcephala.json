    "intro": "Trichera arvensis f. microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf field trichera, is a compact variant of the common trichera. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its small, rounded leaves and delicate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in early summer. This form is notable for its reduced size compared to the typical species, making it a distinctive feature in botanical studies."
