    "intro": "Thelypteris dodo, commonly known as the Dodo fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris dodo thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its humid, tropical habitat, making it a distinctive member of the fern family."
