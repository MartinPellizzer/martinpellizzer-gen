    "intro": "Toiyabea, commonly known as the desert lily, is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations such as succulent leaves and a deep root system for water storage. Toiyabea species often have a short growing season, blooming in spring before the onset of summer heat. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration in dry landscapes."
