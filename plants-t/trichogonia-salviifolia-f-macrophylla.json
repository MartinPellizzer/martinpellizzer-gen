    "intro": "Trichogonia salviifolia f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved ironweed, is a variant of the ironweed species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically larger than those of the typical form, hence the subspecific name *macrophylla*. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks."
