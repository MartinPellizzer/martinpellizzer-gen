    "intro": "Tragacantha bigelovii, commonly known as desert globemallow, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a distinctive, sticky resin that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions."
