It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control."
