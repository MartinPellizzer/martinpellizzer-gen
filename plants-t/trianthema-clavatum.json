    "intro": "Trianthema clavatum, commonly known as the clustered sandbur, is an annual plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces spiny, bristly fruits that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
