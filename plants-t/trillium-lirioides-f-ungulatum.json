    "intro": "Trillium lirioides f. ungulatum, commonly known as the spoonleaf trillium, is a rare and striking variant of the trillium genus native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, spoon-shaped leaves and showy white flowers with a greenish tint. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, organic soil. It is a herbaceous perennial with a short stem and three broad, lanceolate leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
