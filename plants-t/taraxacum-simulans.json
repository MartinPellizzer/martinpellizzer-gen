    "intro": "Taraxacum simulans, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a single, hairy stem that bears a yellow flower head. Its flowers develop into a distinctive, hollow, crown-like structure known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. Taraxacum simulans is often mistaken for the common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) due to its similar appearance."
