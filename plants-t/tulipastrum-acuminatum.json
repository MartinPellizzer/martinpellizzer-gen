    "intro": "Tulipastrum acuminatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tulip tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces showy, tulip-like flowers in late spring, which are typically pink to red in color. These flowers are borne on short pedicels and are accompanied by small, yellowish bracts. Tulipastrum acuminatum is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland areas."
