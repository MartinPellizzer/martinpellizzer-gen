    "intro": "Tillandsia brachycaulos var. multiflora, commonly known as the dwarf tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with showy, violet or pink flowers. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
