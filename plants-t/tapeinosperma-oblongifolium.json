    "intro": "Tapeinosperma oblongifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandmat, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
