    "intro": "Trisetum antarcticum var. tenellum, commonly known as Antarctic hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the cold climates of the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme cold and high UV radiation. Its ability to survive in harsh environments makes it an important component of Antarctic and sub-Antarctic ecosystems."
