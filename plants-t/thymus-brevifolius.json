    "intro": "Thymus brevifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length, giving it a dense, carpet-like appearance. The plant produces tiny pink or purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are widely used in cooking and traditional medicine for their pungent, slightly minty fragrance. Thymus brevifolius thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant ground cover plant."
