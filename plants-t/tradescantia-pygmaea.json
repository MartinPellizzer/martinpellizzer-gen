    "intro": "Tradescantia pygmaea, commonly known as the inch plant, is a low-growing perennial succulent native to Mexico. It features fleshy, strap-like leaves that are typically bright green with red or purple edges, especially under direct sunlight. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
