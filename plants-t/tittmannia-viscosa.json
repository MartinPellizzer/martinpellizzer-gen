    "intro": "Tittmannia viscosa, commonly known as the sticky tittmannia, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves that secrete a viscous resin, giving the plant its common name. The plant typically grows in wet, disturbed soils along stream banks and in swampy areas. Its small, white to greenish flowers appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. Tittmannia viscosa is often found in wetland habitats and is considered an indicator species for certain types of aquatic environments."
