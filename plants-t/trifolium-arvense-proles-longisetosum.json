    "intro": "Trifolium arvense proles longisetosum, commonly known as the long-hairy clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with long, stiff hairs along the edges. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
