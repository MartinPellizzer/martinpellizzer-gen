    "intro": "Tripogandra lundellii, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white flowers. The plant attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily rimu and pohutukawa, through specialized structures called haustelia. It produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native birds. Due to habitat loss, Tripogandra lundellii is considered vulnerable and is protected in its natural range."
