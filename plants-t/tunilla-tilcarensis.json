    "intro": "Tunilla tilcarensis, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in the evening. Its fruit is a fleshy berry that ripens to a deep red, often containing several seeds. Tunilla tilcarensis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access underground water sources."
