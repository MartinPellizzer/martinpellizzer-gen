    "intro": "Tetradiclis tenella, commonly known as the slender waterwheel, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, linear leaves that give it a wheel-like appearance. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or floating. Tetradiclis tenella is valued in aquascaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of water conditions."
