    "intro": "Thelypteris coalescens, commonly known as the coalescent shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a rosette shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris coalescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
