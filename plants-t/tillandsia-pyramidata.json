    "intro": "Tillandsia pyramidata, commonly known as the pyramidal air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant that grows without soil, attaching itself to trees or rocks. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from a central stem. It is native to the tropical regions of South America and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
