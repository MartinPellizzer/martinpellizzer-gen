    "intro": "Trifolium eriocephalum subsp. cascadense, commonly known as the Cascade mountain clover, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and have a pale green to reddish hue. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which give it its subspecific name \"eriocephalum,\" meaning \"hairy head.\" It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine meadows. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
