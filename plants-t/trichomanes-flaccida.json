    "intro": "Trichomanes flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Trichomanes flaccida is often considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
