    "intro": "Taraxacum perpusillum, commonly known as the dwarf dandelion, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, small yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, hairless stem and has a fibrous root system. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, gardens, and disturbed areas. Due to its small size and delicate appearance, it is sometimes mistaken for other dandelion species but is distinguished by its compact growth habit."
