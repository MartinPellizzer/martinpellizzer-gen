    "intro": "Turbina oenotheroides, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive globular shape, with dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves that are adapted to arid environments, allowing it to store water efficiently. Its root system is deep and robust, enabling it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Turbina oenotheroides is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
