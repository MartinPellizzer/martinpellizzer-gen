    "intro": "Taxus communis aurea, commonly known as the golden yew, is a rare and striking variation of the yew tree. It is characterized by its golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its dark, bark-like stems. This plant is evergreen, with needle-like leaves that remain on the plant for several years. It prefers well-drained, acidic soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
