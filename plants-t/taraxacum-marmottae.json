    "intro": "Taraxacum marmottae, commonly known as the Marmottae dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy pappus for seed dispersal. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant is notable for its adaptations to cold climates and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
