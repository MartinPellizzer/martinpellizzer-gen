    "intro": "Taeniophyllum rudolfii var. productilis, commonly known as the red-flowered staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that form a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are typically clustered in groups called sori. Its unique morphology allows it to thrive in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks. The plant's ornamental value has made it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
