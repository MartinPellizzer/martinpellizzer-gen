    "intro": "Toxicodendron radicans var. rhomboideum, commonly known as the Eastern poison ivy, is a variant of the broader Toxicodendron radicans species. It is a deciduous vine characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet typically shaped like a rhombus, hence its varietal name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by reddish, spherical berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is known for its potent urushiol oil, which causes severe skin irritation upon contact. This variant is particularly prevalent in the eastern United States and is a common allergen for many people."
