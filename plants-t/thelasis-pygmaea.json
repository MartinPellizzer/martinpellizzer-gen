    "intro": "Thelasis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of coniferous trees. It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host tree's vascular system. It is native to regions of North America and is often found in forested areas with suitable host trees. Thelasis pygmaea plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for various birds and insects."
