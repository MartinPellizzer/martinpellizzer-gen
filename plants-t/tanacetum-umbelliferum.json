It is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has finely divided, fern-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Tanacetum umbelliferum is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its calming and anti-inflammatory effects."
