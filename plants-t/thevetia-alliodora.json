It is characterized by its smooth, light green bark and its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.
