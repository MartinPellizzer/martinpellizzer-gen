    "intro": "Tripsacum, commonly known as wild maize, is a genus of grasses native to South America. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is closely related to maize (Zea mays). The plant typically grows as a tall, perennial grass with narrow, blade-like leaves and produces panicles of small, clustered flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in spikelets, and the plant is often found in dry, disturbed habitats. Tripsacum has been studied for its potential agricultural and ecological significance."
