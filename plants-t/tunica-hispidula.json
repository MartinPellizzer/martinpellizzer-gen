It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Native to parts of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, tropical environments. Its fibrous stems and thick leaves make it suitable for ornamental gardening. Tunica hispidula is also valued for its potential use in traditional medicine."
