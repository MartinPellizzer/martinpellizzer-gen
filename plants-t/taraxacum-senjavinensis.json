It is native to the Balkan Peninsula, particularly found in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. This plant is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a white, puffed seed head. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features."
