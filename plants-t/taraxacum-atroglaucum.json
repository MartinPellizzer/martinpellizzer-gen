    "intro": "Taraxacum atroglaucum, commonly known as the dark bluish dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark blue to purple flowers, which are surrounded by a white, fluffy pappus for wind dispersal. The plant has a robust, hairy stem and basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, sticky hairs. Its leaves and flowers contain compounds that have been traditionally used in herbal medicine. The species is adapted to grow in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments."
