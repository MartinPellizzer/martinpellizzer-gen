    "intro": "Toxicodendron orientale subsp. hispidum, commonly known as the Japanese lacquer tree, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that turn red in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by clustered, reddish fruits. It is valued for its durable wood, which is traditionally used in the production of lacquerware. However, it contains urushiol, a toxic resin that can cause severe skin irritation in humans."
