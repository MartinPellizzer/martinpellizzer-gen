    "intro": "Tillandsia harrisii, commonly known as the Harris\u2019s air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. It produces vibrant purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia harrisii is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its ability to absorb moisture from the air."
