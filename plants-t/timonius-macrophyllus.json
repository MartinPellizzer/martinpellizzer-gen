    "intro": "Timonius macrophyllus, commonly known as the broad-leaf timonius, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Asia. It features large, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Timonius macrophyllus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
