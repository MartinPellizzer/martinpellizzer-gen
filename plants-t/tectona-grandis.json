    "intro": "Tectona grandis, commonly known as Indian teak, is a tropical hardwood tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, three-lobed fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Its heartwood is highly valued for its durability, resistance to decay, and attractive golden-brown color. Tectona grandis is often cultivated for timber and has ecological importance in its native habitats."
