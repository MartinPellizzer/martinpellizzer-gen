    "intro": "Tilia platyphyllos, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lime, is a deciduous tree native to southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of other lime species. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, round fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often developing shallow fissures with age. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
