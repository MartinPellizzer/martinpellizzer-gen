    "intro": "Toxocarpus patens, commonly known as the slender spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, thriving in moist, sandy soils. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy texture. The showy yellowish-orange cyathium, which is the modified inflorescence, is a key botanical feature for identification."
