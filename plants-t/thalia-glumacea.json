    "intro": "Thalia glumacea, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which are adapted to withstand salt spray and sandy soils. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense clusters that help stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss in arid conditions. Thalia glumacea is a hardy perennial that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens."
