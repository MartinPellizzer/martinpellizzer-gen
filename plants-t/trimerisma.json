It is characterized by its distinctive, showy inflorescences that resemble coral-like clusters, which give it its common name. The plants typically have compound leaves and produce small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Trimerisma species are native to various regions in Africa and are often found in dry or semi-arid habitats. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
