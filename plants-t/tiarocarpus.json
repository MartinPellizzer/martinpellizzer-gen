    "intro": "Tiarocarpus, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of about 15 species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Madagascar. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees with opposite, often leathery leaves. They produce small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release the seeds, which are often covered in a sticky, resinous substance."
