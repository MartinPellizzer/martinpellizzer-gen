    "intro": "Thelypteris pulchra, commonly known as the pretty shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a refined appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in suitable habitats. The fronds are evergreen, maintaining their vibrant color throughout the year."
