    "intro": "Thymus pulegioides var. clandestinus, commonly known as the secret thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, aromatic leaves that are densely packed and often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and fragrant foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements. Due to its restricted habitat and rarity, it is considered a protected species in several regions."
