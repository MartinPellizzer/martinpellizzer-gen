    "intro": "Tubella lenticularis, commonly known as the lens-shaped liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its flat, ribbon-like thallus that often forms dense mats on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant typically grows in temperate regions, preferring damp soil or rock surfaces. Its structure consists of a single layer of cells with a distinct midrib, and it reproduces via spores released from leaf-like structures called phyllidia. Tubella lenticularis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
