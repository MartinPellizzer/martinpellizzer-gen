    "intro": "Thymus ciliatus f. major, commonly known as the large-leaved thyme, is a subspecies of thyme characterized by its larger, more elongated leaves compared to typical thyme varieties. It is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, often found in rocky soils and sunny environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, making it useful in culinary and medicinal applications. The foliage is typically dense and compact, forming a carpet-like ground cover."
