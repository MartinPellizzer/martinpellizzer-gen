    "intro": "Thelypteris frodoi, commonly known as the Frodo's water fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread through the understory vegetation. Thelypteris frodoi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
