    "intro": "Tillaea muscosa, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a small, mat-forming succulent native to arctic and alpine regions. It features dense, compact growth with tiny, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold climates with low precipitation. Tillaea muscosa is often used in rock gardens and alpine collections due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
