    "intro": "Trinia stankovii, commonly known as the Stankovi\u0107's trinia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Trinia stankovii is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions and its limited distribution."
