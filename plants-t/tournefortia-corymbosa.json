    "intro": "Tournefortia corymbosa, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas, preferring sandy or limestone soils. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually yellow or orange with a red throat, blooming throughout the year in warm climates. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and can be branched. Tournefortia corymbosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
