    "intro": "Thlaspi densiflorum, commonly known as denseflowered pennycress, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and roadsides. It has a short life cycle, completing its growth and reproduction within a single growing season. Thlaspi densiflorum is also known for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it a potential candidate for phytoremediation."
