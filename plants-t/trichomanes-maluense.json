    "intro": "Trichomanes maluense, commonly known as the Maluense water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing capsules, are small and clustered on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes maluense plays a minor but ecologically significant role in maintaining the biodiversity of its native habitats."
