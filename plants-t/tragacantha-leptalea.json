    "intro": "Tragacantha leptalea, commonly known as the Persian gum or tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pods containing seeds. Its most notable feature is the production of a gelatinous resin, which has been used for centuries in various traditional and medicinal applications. This resin, known as tragacanth, is harvested from the plant's pods and is valued for its thickening and emulsifying properties."
