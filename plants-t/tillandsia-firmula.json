    "intro": "Tillandsia firmula, commonly known as the firmula air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil for growth, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant features rosette-shaped foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically blooming once in its lifetime. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
