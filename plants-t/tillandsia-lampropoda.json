    "intro": "Tillandsia lampropoda, commonly known as the silver-tipped air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late spring or early summer. Its unique ability to survive without soil makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
