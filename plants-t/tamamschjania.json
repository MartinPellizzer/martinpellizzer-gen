    "intro": "Tamamschjania, commonly known as the star of Borneo, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its unique, star-shaped inflorescence that resembles a cluster of small, colorful flowers. The plant produces both male and female flowers on separate inflorescences, a feature known as dioecy. Tamamschjania thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or in understory layers. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered an important indicator species for tropical rainforest health."
