    "intro": "Thymus albanus subvar. prokletijensis, commonly known as the Prokletij\u00eb thyme, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Albania. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and aromatic, small, grey-green leaves. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
