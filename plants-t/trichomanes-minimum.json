    "intro": "Trichomanes minimum, commonly known as the narrow fern, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, circular groups on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes minimum is noted for its intricate and highly specialized morphology, which reflects its adaptation to humid, low-light conditions."
