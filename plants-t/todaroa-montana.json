    "intro": "Todaroa montana, commonly known as the mountain todaroa, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly rough texture, adapted to the dry, rocky environments it inhabits. Todaroa montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
