    "intro": "Trillium chloropetalum var. giganteum, commonly known as the giant white trillium, is a striking herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with three petals and three sepals, which are often tinged with green. The plant typically grows in rich, moist woodland habitats and has a distinctive three-part leaf structure. It blooms in early spring, often before the canopy of the forest is fully established. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
