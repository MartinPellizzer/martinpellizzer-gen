    "intro": "Trisanthus, commonly known as the \"three-horned\" plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive inflorescence, which consists of three prominent, spiny bracts resembling horns. These bracts are often brightly colored, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which attract pollinators. The plant is native to southern Africa and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Trisanthus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens for their unique appearance."
