    "intro": "Tephrocactus rauhii, commonly known as the Rauh's cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in spines and are typically green in color. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Tephrocactus rauhii is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable plant in botanical collections."
