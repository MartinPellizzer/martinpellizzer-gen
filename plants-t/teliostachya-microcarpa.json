    "intro": "Teliostachya microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf teliostachya, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces slender, branched inflorescences bearing tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Due to its resilience and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in dry gardens and landscapes."
