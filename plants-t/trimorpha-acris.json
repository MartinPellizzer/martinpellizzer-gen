    "intro": "Trimorpha acris, commonly known as the slender bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically blue to purple in color, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and its root system is fibrous and shallow. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
