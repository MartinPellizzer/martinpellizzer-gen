    "intro": "Tarchonanthus procerus, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a large, evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, dark bark and dense, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in challenging climates. Tarchonanthus procerus is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
