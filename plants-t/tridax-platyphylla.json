It is characterized by its hairy, sprawling stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various environmental conditions. Tridax platyphylla is also considered a weed in many regions due to its invasive potential."
