    "intro": "Tirucalia stapelioides, commonly known as the rock fig or stone apple, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, round fruits that resemble small apples. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its thick stems and leaves. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
