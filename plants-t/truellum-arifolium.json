    "intro": "Truellum arifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved truellum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool temperatures. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Truellum arifolium is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
