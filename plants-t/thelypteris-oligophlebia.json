    "intro": "Thelypteris oligophlebia, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its sori, which are clusters of sporangia, are arranged in lines on the undersides of the fronds. Thelypteris oligophlebia thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks."
