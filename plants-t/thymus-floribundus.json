    "intro": "Thymus floribundus, commonly known as the common thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, fragrant, pink or purple flowers that bloom in dense clusters during the summer months. The plant has woody stems that become more prominent with age, and its leaves are narrow, glossy, and aromatic. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Thymus floribundus is also valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
