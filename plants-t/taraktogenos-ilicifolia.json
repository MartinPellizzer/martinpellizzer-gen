    "intro": "Taraktogenos ilicifolia, commonly known as the coastal holly, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds and mammals. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to salt spray from the sea. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in coastal landscaping for erosion control."
