    "intro": "Tressensia viridis, commonly known as the green mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that thrives on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant's leaves are typically small, oval-shaped, and have a waxy, green surface that aids in reducing water loss. Its flowers are usually white or greenish-white, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are important for seed dispersal. Tressensia viridis plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for certain bird species."
