    "intro": "Telinaria anglica, commonly known as the English telinaria, is a flowering plant native to the British Isles. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Telinaria anglica is relatively uncommon and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas."
