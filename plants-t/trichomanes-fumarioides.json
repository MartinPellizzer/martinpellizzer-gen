    "intro": "Trichomanes fumarioides, commonly known as the fumarioid fern, is a member of the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, narrowly lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves. Trichomanes fumarioides is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect light."
