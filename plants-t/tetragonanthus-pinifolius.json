    "intro": "Tetragonanthus pinifolius, commonly known as the pine-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, simple, ovate leaves that are often arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by berries that are typically red or orange in color. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the berries and excrete the seeds onto new host trees. The species is notable for its ability to survive in shaded environments and its unique ecological role in supporting biodiversity."
