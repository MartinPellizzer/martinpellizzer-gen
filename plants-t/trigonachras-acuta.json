    "intro": "Trigonachras acuta, commonly known as the sharp-angled grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in humid climates with ample sunlight. Its flowers are small and clustered, forming panicles that are often overlooked due to the plant's grass-like appearance. Trigonachras acuta plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
