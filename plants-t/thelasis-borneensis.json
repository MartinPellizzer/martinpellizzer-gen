    "intro": "Thelasis borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean thelasis, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with smooth, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Thelasis borneensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role and potential medicinal properties."
