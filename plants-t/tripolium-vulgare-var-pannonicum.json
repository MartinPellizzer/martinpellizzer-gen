    "intro": "Tripolium vulgare var. pannonicum, commonly known as the Pannonian sand thistle, is a flowering plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor environments. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
