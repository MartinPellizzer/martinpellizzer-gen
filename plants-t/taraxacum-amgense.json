    "intro": "Taraxacum amgense, commonly known as the Amur dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and have a waxy coating. The plant produces a hollow, slender stem that rises to bear a single, bright yellow flower head. Its flowers develop into a spherical seed head with parachute-like seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in forests and wetlands."
