It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
