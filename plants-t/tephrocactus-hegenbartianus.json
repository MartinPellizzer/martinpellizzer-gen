    "intro": "Tephrocactus hegenbartianus, commonly known as the Hegenbart's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed stem that typically grows to a height of about 10 centimeters. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are borne in clusters at the base of the stem. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, making it well-suited for desert environments. The plant is also characterized by its spiny areoles, which support the production of both spines and flowers."
