    "intro": "Thunbergia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf morning glory, is a climbing herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctively narrow leaf blade, and its flowers are typically trumpet-shaped with five petals. The plant produces showy, often blue or purple flowers that bloom in the morning, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Thunbergia stenophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its vibrant floral displays."
