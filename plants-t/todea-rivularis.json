    "intro": "Todea rivularis, commonly known as the river toadflax, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland areas. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. Todea rivularis has a fibrous root system and is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants. Its botanical significance lies in its role within wetland ecosystems and its potential use in horticulture."
