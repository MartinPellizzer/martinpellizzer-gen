    "intro": "Tomophyllum hymenophylloides, commonly known as the silver fern, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually clustered at the base, forming a rosette shape that helps retain moisture. The botanical features of Tomophyllum hymenophylloides make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and conservation efforts."
