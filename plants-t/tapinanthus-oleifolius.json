    "intro": "Tapinanthus oleifolius, commonly known as the African dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to sub-Saharan Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a fibrous, root-like structure that attaches to its host. It is often found growing on trees and shrubs, particularly in moist, shaded environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
