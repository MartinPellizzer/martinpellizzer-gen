    "intro": "Tetrapterys phlomoides var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the hairy leaf tetrapterys, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name and aid in reducing water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
