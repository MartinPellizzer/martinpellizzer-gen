    "intro": "Taraxacum catenatum, commonly known as the chain dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and western Asia, and it is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, hollow, and often branched stem that terminates in a yellow flower head. Its seeds are enclosed in a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal. Taraxacum catenatum is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it is a hardy perennial species."
