    "intro": "Tetraneuris brevifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf tetraneuris, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, featuring small, narrow leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its structure is adapted to conserve water, with a compact form and hairy surfaces to reduce transpiration. Tetraneuris brevifolia is often found in rocky soils and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
