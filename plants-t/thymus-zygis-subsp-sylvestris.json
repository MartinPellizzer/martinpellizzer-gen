    "intro": "Thymus zygis subsp. sylvestris, commonly known as wild thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces pink or purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
