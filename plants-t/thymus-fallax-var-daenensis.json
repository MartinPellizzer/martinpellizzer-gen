    "intro": "Thymus fallax var. daenensis, commonly known as the Persian thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It features compact, mat-forming foliage with narrow, gray-green leaves that are aromatic and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant foliage and drought tolerance."
