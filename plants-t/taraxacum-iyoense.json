    "intro": "Taraxacum iyoense, commonly known as the Iyoense dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, hollow stem that supports a spherical, yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. It is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
