It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves with a glossy green surface and a smooth, waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
