    "intro": "Tripsacum dactyloides var. genuinum, commonly known as the wild maize or teosinte, is a grass species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and small, clustered spikelets that bear the plant's distinctive seeds. The plant has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in its native range. Its genetic makeup is closely related to modern maize, offering insights into the domestication process of corn. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in marginal environments."
