    "intro": "Triumfetta simplicifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved triumfetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a shrub or small tree with opposite, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers, followed by three-winged, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. The species is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
