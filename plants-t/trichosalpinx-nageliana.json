    "intro": "Trichosalpinx nageliana, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Trichosalpinx nageliana is a perennial herb that blooms in spring, producing clusters of violet to purple flowers."
