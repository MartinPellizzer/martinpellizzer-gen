    "intro": "Tillandsia muhriae, commonly known as the Muhriae Air Plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, colorful inflorescences with white or pink flowers. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
