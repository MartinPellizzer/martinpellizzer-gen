    "intro": "Trisetaria subalpestris, commonly known as the alpine grass or alpine needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Trisetaria subalpestris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
