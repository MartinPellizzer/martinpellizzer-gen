It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in full sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is well adapted to the arid and saline conditions of its habitat. Tehuana calzadae plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing nectar for local pollinators."
