    "intro": "Thalictrum multiflorum, commonly known as the common meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and often covered in a soft, silvery down. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Thalictrum multiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to support biodiversity in natural habitats."
