    "intro": "Tragacantha stipulosa, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, sticky resinous pods. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in harsh environments. The resin, known as tragacanth, has been used historically in medicine and as a natural gum in various industries."
