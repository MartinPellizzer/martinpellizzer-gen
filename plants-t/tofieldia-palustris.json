    "intro": "Tofieldia palustris, commonly known as swamp lily, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and bogs. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Tofieldia palustris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize wetland environments."
