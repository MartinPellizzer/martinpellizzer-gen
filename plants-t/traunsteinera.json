    "intro": "Traunsteinera, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of only two species, both native to South America, particularly in the Andes region. The plants are shrubs characterized by their evergreen leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to red. Traunsteinera species are adapted to grow in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or well-drained soils. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler, moist climates."
