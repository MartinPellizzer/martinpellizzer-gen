    "intro": "Trivalvaria nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, floating leaves with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant has intricate, delicate flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. Its vascular system is adapted to support growth in water, with specialized tissues for oxygen transport. Trivalvaria nervosa plays a role in water purification and provides habitat for aquatic organisms."
