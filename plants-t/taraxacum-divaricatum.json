It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a bright yellow flower that develops into a white, fluffy seed head, which is adapted for wind dispersal. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in a variety of habitats including meadows and disturbed soils. Due to its adaptability, it is often considered a common weed in gardens and agricultural fields."
