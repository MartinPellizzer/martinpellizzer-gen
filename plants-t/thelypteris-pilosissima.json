    "intro": "Thelypteris pilosissima, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, hairy scales. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a lush green appearance throughout the year."
