    "intro": "Tuberaria annua subsp. degenii, commonly known as the Degen's annual tuberaria, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Scrophulariaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
