It is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy white pappus for wind dispersal. Native to Central Asia, it thrives in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in steppe and mountainous regions. The plant produces a milky sap that contains various compounds, some of which have been studied for potential medicinal properties. Its morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species within the genus Taraxacum."
