    "intro": "Triolena stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf triolena, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or forest understory environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively uncommon in horticultural trade."
