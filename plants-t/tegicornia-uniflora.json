    "intro": "Tegicornia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered hairgrass, is a species of grass native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered at the base of the leaf sheaths. Tegicornia uniflora is adapted to saline and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in coastal dunes and rocky areas. Its ecological importance lies in its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates."
