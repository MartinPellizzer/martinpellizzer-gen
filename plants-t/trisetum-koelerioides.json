    "intro": "Trisetum koelerioides, commonly known as the Koeler's wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Trisetum koelerioides is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
