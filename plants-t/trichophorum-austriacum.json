    "intro": "Trichophorum austriacum, commonly known as the Austrian hairgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass species native to temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, soft foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks. It is a perennial species that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies that help stabilize soil. Trichophorum austriacum plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small vertebrates."
