    "intro": "Tillandsia atroviridipetala var. longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-stemmed green-leaf tillandsia, is a bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features elongated, narrow leaves that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. Its inflorescence consists of long, pendulous flower stems bearing small, white or pale pink flowers. This variety is appreciated for its striking appearance and air-purifying qualities, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
