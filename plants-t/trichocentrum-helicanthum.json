    "intro": "Trichocentrum helicanthum, commonly known as the orchid with the spiral-shaped flowers, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often displaying a spiral pattern that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its roots are specialized for absorbing water and nutrients, and its leaves are usually broad and leathery. Trichocentrum helicanthum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
