    "intro": "Tamarix brachylepis, commonly known as the coastal tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces pink to reddish flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to coastal and saline soils, making it a common species in coastal dunes and salt marshes. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive."
