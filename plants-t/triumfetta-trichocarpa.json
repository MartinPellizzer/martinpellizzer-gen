It is a small shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and clusters of small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and blooms."
