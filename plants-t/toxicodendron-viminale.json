    "intro": "Toxicodendron viminale, commonly known as the poison ivy vine, is a deciduous flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. Due to its allergenic properties, it is often considered a noxious weed in its native habitats."
