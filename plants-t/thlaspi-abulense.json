    "intro": "Thlaspi abulense, commonly known as the alpine cress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and is adapted to cold, rocky environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Thlaspi abulense is often found in alpine meadows and is considered an indicator species for arctic and alpine ecosystems."
