    "intro": "Toxicodendron undulatum, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of ovate leaflets, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. However, it can cause skin irritation due to the presence of urushiol, a compound found in many members of the Anacardiaceae family."
