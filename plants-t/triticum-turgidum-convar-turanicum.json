    "intro": "Triticum turgidum convar. turanicum, commonly known as the wild emmer wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Fertile Crescent. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and spike-like inflorescence, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and has a robust root system that helps it thrive in various soil types. Its leaves are narrow and sword-shaped, with a prominent midrib, and it produces hard, durable grains. This species is considered an important ancestor of modern cultivated wheat varieties."
