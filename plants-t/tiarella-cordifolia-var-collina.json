    "intro": "Tiarella cordifolia var. collina, commonly known as the Appalachian foamflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is well-suited for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its persistent foliage and delicate floral display."
