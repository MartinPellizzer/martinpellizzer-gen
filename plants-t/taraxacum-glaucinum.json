    "intro": "Taraxacum glaucinum, commonly known as the blue burdock, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that are typically spoon-shaped. The plant produces a single, elongated flowering stem topped with a composite flower head that transitions from yellow to purple as it matures. Its fruit is a spiky, bristled achene that aids in wind dispersal. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides."
