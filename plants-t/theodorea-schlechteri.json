    "intro": "Theodorea schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces nodding inflorescences with fragrant, white to pale pink petals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
