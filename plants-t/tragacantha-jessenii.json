    "intro": "Tragacantha jessenii, commonly known as the African tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces a gum-like substance from its stems, which has been used traditionally for its adhesive and medicinal properties. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Due to its unique botanical features and historical uses, it remains an important species in both ecological and ethnobotanical studies."
