It features slender, upright stems covered with soft, hairy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and slightly aromatic. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, often arranged in compact clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. Teucrium mollifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
