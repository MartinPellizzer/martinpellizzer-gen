    "intro": "Thalictrum umbricola, commonly known as the shade-loving meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the forests of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. It has a fibrous root system and thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. Thalictrum umbricola is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora in forest understories."
