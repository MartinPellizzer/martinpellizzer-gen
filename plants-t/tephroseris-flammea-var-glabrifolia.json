    "intro": "Tephroseris flammea var. glabrifolia, commonly known as the flamebrush lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive orange to reddish-brown thallus with a smooth, leathery texture. The plant features a dense network of rhizines that anchor it to substrates like bark or soil. Its apothecia are typically small and disc-shaped, with a smooth, reddish margin. This lichen is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator of clean, humid air."
