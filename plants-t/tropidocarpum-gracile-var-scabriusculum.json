    "intro": "Tropidocarpum gracile var. scabriusculum, commonly known as the smoothleaf rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth or slightly hairy, depending on the variety. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
