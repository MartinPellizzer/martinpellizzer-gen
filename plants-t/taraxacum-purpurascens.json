    "intro": "Taraxacum purpurascens, commonly known as the purple dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flower heads and distinctive, hairy, lobed leaves. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The leaves are typically basal and form a rosette, while the flower stems are usually unbranched. It produces a capsule-like fruit that disperses its seeds via the wind, a common trait among dandelions."
