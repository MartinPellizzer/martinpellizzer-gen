    "intro": "Trichilia breviflora, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
