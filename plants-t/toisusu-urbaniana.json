    "intro": "Toisusu urbaniana, commonly known as the urban twilight orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly in the dark, an adaptation that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique blooming cycle occurs during the late evening, coinciding with the activity of its primary pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Toisusu urbaniana is now classified as an endangered species."
