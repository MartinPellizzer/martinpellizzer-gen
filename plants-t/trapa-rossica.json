    "intro": "Trapa rossica, commonly known as the Russian water shield, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are broad and shield-shaped, with a waxy upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged or partially submerged in water. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, boat-shaped fruit that aids in dispersal. Trapa rossica plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
