    "intro": "Tillandsia paniculata var. genuina, commonly known as the silver vane air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its dense, silver-green foliage that forms a rosette shape. It produces striking inflorescences with showy, pinkish-white bracts that bloom in the summer. This air plant requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive."
