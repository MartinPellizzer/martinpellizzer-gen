    "intro": "Thymus parnassicus, commonly known as Parnassian thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high mountain regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, tiny, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and other compounds, contribute to its strong fragrance and medicinal properties. Thymus parnassicus is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though it is less common in commercial cultivation compared to other thyme species."
