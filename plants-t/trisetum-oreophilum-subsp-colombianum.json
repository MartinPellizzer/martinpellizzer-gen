The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests and mountainous habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native environment."
