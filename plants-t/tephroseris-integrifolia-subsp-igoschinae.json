    "intro": "Tephroseris integrifolia subsp. igoschinae, commonly known as the Igoschinae rock cress, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with distinctive cruciform flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
