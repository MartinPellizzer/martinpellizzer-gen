    "intro": "Tetragonia tetrapteris, commonly known as sea beet, is a halophytic plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Australia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to tolerate saline and arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and can store water, aiding in its survival in harsh environments. Tetragonia tetrapteris is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and edible leaves."
