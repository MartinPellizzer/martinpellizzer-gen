    "intro": "Trichocentrum leptotifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs and produces pendant, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Trichocentrum leptotifolium thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
