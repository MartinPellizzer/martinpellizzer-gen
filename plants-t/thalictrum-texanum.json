    "intro": "Thalictrum texanum, commonly known as Texas meadowrue, is a perennial herb native to the central and southern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils in prairies, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, branched stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers in early spring. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided leaflets that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits to pollinators."
