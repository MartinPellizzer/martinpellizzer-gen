    "intro": "Taraxacum hastile, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, showy yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
