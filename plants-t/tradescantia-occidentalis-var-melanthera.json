It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a striking dark green to almost black coloration. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of violet or blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value comes from its unique foliage and delicate floral display."
