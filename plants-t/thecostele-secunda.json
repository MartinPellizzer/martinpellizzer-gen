It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep purple to bright red. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. Its flowers bloom in the spring and are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
