    "intro": "Taraxacum calomorphum, commonly known as the dark-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, waxy leaves and a long, slender stem that bears a single yellow flower head. The plant is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in grasslands and rocky areas. It produces a distinctive, hollow, wind-dispersed seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
