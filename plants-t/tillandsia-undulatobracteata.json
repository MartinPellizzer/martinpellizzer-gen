    "intro": "Tillandsia undulatobracteata, commonly known as the undulating bract tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with colorful, showy flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal direct sunlight to flourish."
