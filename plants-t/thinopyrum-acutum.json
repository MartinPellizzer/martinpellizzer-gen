    "intro": "Thinopyrum acutum, commonly known as the acutely pointed wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Thinopyrum acutum is often found in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky soils. It has been studied for its potential in forage and as a source of genetic material for wheat improvement."
