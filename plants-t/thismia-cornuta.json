    "intro": "Thismia cornuta, commonly known as the horned Thismia, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated, horn-like structure at the base of its single, tubular flower. The plant is mycoheterotrophic, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. Its flowers are typically pale green or yellowish and are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, Thismia cornuta is considered a critically endangered species."
