    "intro": "Tetrapterys peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian tetraptery, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into four or five lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are capsule-like structures containing numerous seeds. Tetrapterys peruviana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
