    "intro": "Taraxacum scorzonera, commonly known as the Italian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous lightweight seeds with feathery parachutes, facilitating wind dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The roots of Taraxacum scorzonera are edible and have been used in traditional cuisine and herbal remedies."
