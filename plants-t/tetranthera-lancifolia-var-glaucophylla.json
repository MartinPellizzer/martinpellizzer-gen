    "intro": "Tetranthera lancifolia var. glaucophylla, commonly known as the glaucophylla tetranthera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, branched stems that often grow close to the ground, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive glaucous (bluish-gray) underside. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its foliage is characterized by a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variant is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
