It belongs to the Theaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant is notable for its unique chemical composition, which contributes to its distinct flavor profile in tea production. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered a conservation concern. Its botanical features make it an important subject for both horticultural and ecological research."
