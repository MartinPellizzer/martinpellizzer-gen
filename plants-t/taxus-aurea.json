    "intro": "Taxus aurea, commonly known as the golden yew, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, compact form and foliage that transitions from bright yellow to deep green as the plant matures. The leaves are needle-like, stiff, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its unique color and resilience."
