    "intro": "Tinus lateriflora, commonly known as the coastal bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, bottle-shaped stems that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright red or orange flowers along the sides of its stems, giving it its common name. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. Tinus lateriflora is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including high salinity and strong winds."
