    "intro": "Tipuana amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian tipuana, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a broad, spreading canopy and compound leaves. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The wood of Tipuana amazonica is valued for its strength and durability, though it is not widely commercially harvested due to its limited distribution."
