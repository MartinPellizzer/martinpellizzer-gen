It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. It is adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions with minimal water requirements. Tephrocactus rauppianus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
