    "intro": "Tritoma sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping tritoma, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Tritoma sarmentosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
