    "intro": "Toxopteris subtrifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved rock fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its intricate, delicate fronds that typically consist of three leaflets, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in woodland areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and they are covered by a protective flap known as an indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems where it contributes to soil stability and biodiversity."
