    "intro": "Truellum stelligerum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking, spiky blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silvery-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. Truellum stelligerum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky shores or dunes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
