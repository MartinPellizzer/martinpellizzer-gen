It is characterized by its broad, glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Tricalysia macrophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
