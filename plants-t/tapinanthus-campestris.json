    "intro": "Tapinanthus campestris, commonly known as the strangle vine, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the stems of other plants, often leading to their demise. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients and water. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like leaves. It is native to various regions in Africa and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
