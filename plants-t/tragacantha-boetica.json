    "intro": "Tragacantha boetica, commonly known as the Italian gum plant, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by pods containing seeds. It is known for its ability to exude a sticky resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Tragacantha boetica is often found in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
