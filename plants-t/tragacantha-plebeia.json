    "intro": "Tragacantha plebeia, commonly known as the lesser tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. Its roots are known for secreting a viscous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Tragacantha plebeia thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodland and scrub habitats."
