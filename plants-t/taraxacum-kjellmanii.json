    "intro": "Taraxacum kjellmanii, commonly known as the Kjellman's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a single, elongated stem that bears a bright yellow flower head. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in dry, rocky, or sandy soils. It produces a distinctive, hollow stem with a milky sap, and its flowers are followed by a crown of bracts that form the characteristic seed dispersal mechanism. This species is typically perennial and exhibits a low-growing habit, making it well adapted to its arid or semi-arid habitats."
