    "intro": "Taraxacum excellens, commonly known as the splendid dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single, bright yellow composite flower head. The flower develops into a spherical, fluffy seed head known as a pappus, which is adapted for wind dispersal. Native to Europe, it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a hardy and easily identifiable plant in the dandelion genus."
