    "intro": "Trichilia catigua var. pallens, commonly known as the pale catigua, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its ornamental, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemose inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The pale catigua is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and thrives in well-drained, fertile soils."
