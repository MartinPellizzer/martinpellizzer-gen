    "intro": "Tragopogon porrifolius, commonly known as the lawn dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces a distinctive yellow flower with a crown-like structure. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns and along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and adaptability. Tragopogon porrifolius has also been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
