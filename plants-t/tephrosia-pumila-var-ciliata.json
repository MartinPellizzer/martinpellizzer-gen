It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves with ciliate margins, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that are typically arranged in terminal racemes. It is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
