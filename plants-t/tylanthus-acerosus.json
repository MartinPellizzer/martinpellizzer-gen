    "intro": "Tylanthus acerosus, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and dark, glossy leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Tylanthus acerosus is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental appeal."
