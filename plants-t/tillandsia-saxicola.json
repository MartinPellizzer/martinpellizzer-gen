    "intro": "Tillandsia saxicola, commonly known as the rock tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that collect moisture from the air. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. Tillandsia saxicola is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic."
