It is a small, shrub-like plant that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are usually opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release two small, smooth seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
