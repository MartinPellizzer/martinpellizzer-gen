    "intro": "Thalictrum dubium, commonly known as the slender meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and features delicate, fern-like leaves with a distinctive, airy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic properties. Thalictrum dubium is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
