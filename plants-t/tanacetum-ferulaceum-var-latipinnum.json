    "intro": "Tanacetum ferulaceum var. latipinnum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, aromatic leaves and yellow button-like flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and prefers well-drained soils in full sun. Its foliage emits a strong, camphor-like scent, which is due to the presence of essential oils such as thymol and carvacrol. This variety is often used in traditional medicine and as a companion plant in gardens due to its pest-repelling properties."
