    "intro": "Tragacantha porphyrobaphis, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Iran and Afghanistan. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody, thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by inflated pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. The gum exuded from its bark has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive."
