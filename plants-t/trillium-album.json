    "intro": "Trillium album, commonly known as the white trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its three large, white, waxy petals and three sepals that are similar in size and shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has a distinctive three-lobed leaf that emerges from a single stem. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. Trillium album is known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically in traditional herbal remedies."
