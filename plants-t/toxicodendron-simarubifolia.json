    "intro": "Toxicodendron simarubifolia, commonly known as the red root tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and opposite, simple, elliptical leaves that are often dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. It is also known for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities. However, it can cause skin irritation in some individuals due to the presence of irritant compounds."
