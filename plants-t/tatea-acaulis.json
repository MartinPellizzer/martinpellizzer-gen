    "intro": "Tatea acaulis, commonly known as the naked-stemmed flax, is a herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are often leafless except for a few basal leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom in spring. Tatea acaulis is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it an important part of New Zealand's native flora and a subject of ecological study."
