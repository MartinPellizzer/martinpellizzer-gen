    "intro": "Tithymalus involucratus, commonly known as the narrowleaf tithymalus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring slender stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with serrated edges, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Tithymalus involucratus is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and other moist, sunny habitats."
