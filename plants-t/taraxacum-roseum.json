    "intro": "Taraxacum roseum, commonly known as the rose-colored dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in meadows and grasslands. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The species is notable for its vibrant pink to rose-colored petals, which distinguish it from other dandelion species."
