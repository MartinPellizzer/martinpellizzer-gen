    "intro": "Thouinia portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a silky, fibrous covering. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
