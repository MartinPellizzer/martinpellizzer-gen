    "intro": "Taraxacum palustre subsp. litophyllum, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features a rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and produces a single, slender flowering stem topped with a composite yellow flower head. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in alpine ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important component of mountain flora and a subject of interest in plant ecology."
