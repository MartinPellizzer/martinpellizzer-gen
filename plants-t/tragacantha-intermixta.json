It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces a resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a rough, hairy texture. Tragacantha intermixta is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils."
