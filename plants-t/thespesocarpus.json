It is characterized by its woody structure and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged environments. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, including mangrove forests and tidal zones. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly fleshy, adapted to retain moisture. Thespesocarpus species produce small, clustered flowers that are often pink or red, followed by small, fleshy fruits."
