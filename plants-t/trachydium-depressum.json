    "intro": "Trachydium depressum, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its compact growth habit and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important component of desert ecosystems. Trachydium depressum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
