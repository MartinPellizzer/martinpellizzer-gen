    "intro": "Tectaria distincta, commonly known as the broad-leaf shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical and subtropical forests. Its fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Tectaria distincta is notable for its unique reproductive structures, which are protected by a specialized, shield-like covering."
