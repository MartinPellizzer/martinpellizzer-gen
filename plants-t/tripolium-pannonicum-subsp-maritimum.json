    "intro": "Tripolium pannonicum subsp. maritimum, commonly known as the coastal tansy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically visited by a variety of pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
