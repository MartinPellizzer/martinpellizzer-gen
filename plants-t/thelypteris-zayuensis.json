    "intro": "Thelypteris zayuensis, commonly known as the Yunnan holly fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are wiry and often covered in a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. Thelypteris zayuensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
