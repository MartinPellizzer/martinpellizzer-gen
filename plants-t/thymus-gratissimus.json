    "intro": "Thymus gratissimus, commonly known as sweet thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features slender, creeping stems and small, fragrant leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and other compounds, contribute to its antimicrobial properties. Thymus gratissimus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and herbal cultivation."
