    "intro": "Toxicodendron toxicarum f. elobatum, commonly known as the giant poison ivy, is a variant of the poison ivy plant characterized by its larger leaves and more vigorous growth. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is native to parts of the southeastern United States. The plant produces a resinous sap that contains urushiol, a potent allergen responsible for skin irritation and itching. Its leaves are typically three-lobed, with a shiny upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside. This variant is often found in moist, wooded areas and can grow as a vine or shrub."
