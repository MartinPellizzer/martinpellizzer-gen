It features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a desirable addition to both cultivated and natural settings."
