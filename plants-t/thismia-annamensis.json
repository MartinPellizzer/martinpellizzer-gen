    "intro": "Thismia annamensis, commonly known as the Annam ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thismiaceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies entirely on fungal associations for nutrition. The plant produces small, white, lantern-like flowers that emit a faint, sweet scent to attract specific pollinators. It thrives in shaded, humid environments within forest understories, often growing on decaying wood or soil. Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
