    "intro": "Thea sasanqua, commonly known as the Japanese holly or winter jasmine, is a flowering shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late autumn to early winter. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often left for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Thea sasanqua is also valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand colder temperatures."
