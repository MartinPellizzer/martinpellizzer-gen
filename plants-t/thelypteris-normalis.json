    "intro": "Thelypteris normalis, commonly known as the common shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into small, serrated segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to the substrate. Thelypteris normalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, green foliage."
