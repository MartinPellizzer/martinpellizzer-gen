    "intro": "Thymus macrophyllus, commonly known as large-leaved thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, small white or pink flowers and broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its foliage is densely packed, which helps in preventing erosion and providing ground cover. Thymus macrophyllus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
