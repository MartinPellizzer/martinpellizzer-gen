    "intro": "Tremacron rubrum, commonly known as the crimson flame fern, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its vibrant red foliage and unique frond structure. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to the humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. The plant features delicate, feather-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, shaded environments. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is relatively rare in cultivation due to its specific environmental requirements."
