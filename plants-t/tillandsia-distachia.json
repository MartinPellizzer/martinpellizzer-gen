    "intro": "Tillandsia distachia, commonly known as the silver vane orchid, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding cup. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a subtle fragrance. Its epiphytic nature allows it to grow on trees without harming them, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Tillandsia distachia is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
