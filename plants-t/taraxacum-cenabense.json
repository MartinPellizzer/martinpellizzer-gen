    "intro": "Taraxacum cenabense, commonly known as the Italian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically lanceolate and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, hollow, leaf-like stem that terminates in a bright yellow flower head, which develops into a fluffy white pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Botanically, it is closely related to other dandelion species within the Asteraceae family."
