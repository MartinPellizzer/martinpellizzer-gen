    "intro": "Trichonema parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flower trichonema, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, herbaceous stems and small, lanceolate leaves arranged alternately along the stem. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its native range."
