It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate appearance to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed sites. Its botanical features make it an attractive and resilient plant for ecological restoration projects."
