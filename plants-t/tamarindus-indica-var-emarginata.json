    "intro": "Tamarindus indica var. emarginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tamarind, is a variant of the tamarind tree characterized by its narrower leaves and slightly different fruit morphology. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, with a spreading canopy and thick, ridged bark. Its fruit, which is typically smaller than the standard tamarind, contains a sour pulp rich in tannins and used in culinary and medicinal applications. The leaves are often used as a natural dye and in traditional herbal remedies."
