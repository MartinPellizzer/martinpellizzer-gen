    "intro": "Trifolium pratense var. americanum, commonly known as white clover, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. White clover thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, moist soils. It is often used in forage agriculture and as a cover crop due to its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
