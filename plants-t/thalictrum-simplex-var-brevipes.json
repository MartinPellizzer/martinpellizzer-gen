    "intro": "Thalictrum simplex var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed meadow rue, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply divided and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers in early to mid-summer. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and thrives in partial to full shade. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
