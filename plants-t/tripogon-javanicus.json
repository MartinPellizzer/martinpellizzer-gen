    "intro": "Tripogon javanicus, commonly known as the Java grass or Javanese grass, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. The plant has slender, erect stems that are usually less than 1 meter in height, with narrow, linear leaves that are smooth and grass-like in appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the apex of each stem, which is a distinctive feature of the genus Tripogon. The seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to spread in suitable environments."
