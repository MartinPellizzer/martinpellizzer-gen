    "intro": "Tragacantha berythea, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is known for producing a valuable gum, tragacanth, which has been used historically in medicine and as a thickening agent. Its leaves are trifoliate, and the plant thrives in well-drained soils with minimal water requirements. Tragacantha berythea is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
