It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Trichiogramme alismifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic organisms."
