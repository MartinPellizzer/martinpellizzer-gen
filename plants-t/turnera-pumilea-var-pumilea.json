It features trailing stems that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, blooming in the spring and summer months. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant is often used in ornamental gardening for its compact growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover."
