    "intro": "Tetrapogon, commonly known as the four-toothed grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and compact growth habit, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plants typically produce small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Tetrapogon species are generally drought-tolerant, making them well adapted to harsh, dry climates. They play a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in their native habitats."
