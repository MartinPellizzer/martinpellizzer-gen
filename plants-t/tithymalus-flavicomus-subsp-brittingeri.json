    "intro": "Tithymalus flavicomus subsp. brittingeri, commonly known as the Brittinger's tithymalus, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is native to specific regions in southern Europe, where it thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in compound umbels. Its medicinal properties have been historically noted, though it is not widely cultivated for commercial use. The subspecies is distinguished by subtle variations in leaf morphology and flower color compared to the nominate form."
