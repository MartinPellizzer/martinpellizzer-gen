    "intro": "Tapinanthus tschertscherensis, commonly known as the Tschertscher's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to various species of shrubs and trees. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale in color. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas where suitable hosts are present. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have negative impacts on the growth and health of its host plants."
