    "intro": "Toxicodendron angustifolium, commonly known as the eastern poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets that are typically arranged in a cluster. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It contains urushiol, an oil that causes severe skin irritation and allergic reactions in many people. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided and considered a noxious weed in many regions."
