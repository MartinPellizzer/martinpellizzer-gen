    "intro": "Trifolium scabrum f. hirsuticaule, commonly known as the hairy clover, is a variant of the common hairy vetch. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. The hairy stem and leaves give it a distinct appearance, making it easily identifiable in the wild."
