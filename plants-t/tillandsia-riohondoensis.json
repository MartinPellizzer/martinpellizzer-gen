    "intro": "Tillandsia riohondoensis, commonly known as the Rio Hondo airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to grow on trees or rocks. Its unique structure allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions by capturing water and nutrients through its foliage."
