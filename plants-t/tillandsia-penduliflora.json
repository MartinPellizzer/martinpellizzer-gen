    "intro": "Tillandsia penduliflora, commonly known as the pendant-flowered air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces pendulous, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding an ornamental appeal. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
