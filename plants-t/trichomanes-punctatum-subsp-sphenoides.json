    "intro": "Trichomanes punctatum subsp. sphenoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its finely divided, linear fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The subspecies sphenoides is distinguished by its narrower leaves and specific habitat preferences compared to other subspecies of Trichomanes punctatum."
