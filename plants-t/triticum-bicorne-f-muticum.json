    "intro": "Triticum bicorne f. muticum, commonly known as the muticous bichorned wheat, is a rare and distinctive variant of wheat characterized by its reduced florets and shortened glumes. This subspecies exhibits unique morphological traits, including a more compact inflorescence compared to typical wheat species. It is primarily found in specific geographic regions where its habitat conditions are met, often in disturbed or marginal soils. The plant's botanical features make it of interest to taxonomists and botanists studying wheat evolution and variation. Due to its rarity, it is considered a valuable subject for conservation and genetic research."
