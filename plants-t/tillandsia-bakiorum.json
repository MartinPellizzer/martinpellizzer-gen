    "intro": "Tillandsia bakiorum, commonly known as the Bakiorum air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, violet flowers that bloom in the late spring or early summer. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation and botanical gardens."
