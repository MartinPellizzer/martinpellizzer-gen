    "intro": "Tillandsia inconspicua, commonly known as the small air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid forest environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces rather than through roots. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
