    "intro": "Tupacamaria juncea, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and dry landscapes. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its fibrous roots help it survive in harsh, dry environments by storing water. Tupacamaria juncea is also valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
