    "intro": "Tragia geraniifolia var. multifida, commonly known as the featherleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble those of geraniums. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its ornamental appearance and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
