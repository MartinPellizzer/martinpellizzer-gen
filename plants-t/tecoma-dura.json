It features long, narrow leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its rapid growth rate and ability to withstand harsh conditions make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Tecoma dura is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for bees and other pollinators."
