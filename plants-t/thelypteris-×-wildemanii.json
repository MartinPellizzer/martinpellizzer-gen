    "intro": "Thelypteris \u00d7 wildemanii, commonly known as the hybrid winter fern, is a fern species resulting from the cross between Thelypteris acutifrons and Thelypteris jamaicensis. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain green throughout the year, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense, attractive ground covers. The fronds are bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that adds visual interest to gardens and landscapes."
