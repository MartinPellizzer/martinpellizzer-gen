It is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
