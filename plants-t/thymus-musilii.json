    "intro": "Thymus musilii, commonly known as the narrowleaf thyme, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its leaves are often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to their pungent, slightly bitter aroma. Thymus musilii is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
