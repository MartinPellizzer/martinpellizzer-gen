    "intro": "Thalictrum neurocarpum, commonly known as the nodding meadow-rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its flowers are actinomorphic and consist of numerous sepals and petals that are often difficult to distinguish. Thalictrum neurocarpum is valued in gardens for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
