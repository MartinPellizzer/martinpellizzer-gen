    "intro": "Turbinicarpus \u00d7 bellatulus, commonly known as the hybrid moon cactus, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Turbinicarpus callosus and Turbinicarpus truncatus. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded, and often colorful stems that resemble a moon, hence its common name. The plant is native to the arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Its botanical features include thick, fleshy stems with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss."
