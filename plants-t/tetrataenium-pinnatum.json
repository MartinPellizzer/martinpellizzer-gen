It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, featuring narrow, linear leaves arranged in a pinnate pattern. Its flowers are small and yellow, often grouped into clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Tetrataenium pinnatum is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
