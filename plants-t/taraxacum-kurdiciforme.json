    "intro": "Taraxacum kurdiciforme, commonly known as the Kurdish dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, showy yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is native to regions of the Middle East, including parts of Turkey and Iran, and thrives in dry, rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
