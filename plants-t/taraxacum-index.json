    "intro": "Taraxacum index, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a hollow, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus, which allows for efficient seed distribution. Its roots are taproots that can penetrate deep into the soil, making it resilient and hard to eradicate. The plant is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often considered a weed in gardens and lawns."
