    "intro": "Tunica glumacea, commonly known as the glume-bearing tunica, is a specialized plant structure found in certain grass species. It refers to the outer layer of the lemma and palea in grass florets, which are modified leaves. This structure plays a crucial role in protecting the reproductive organs of the flower. The tunica glumacea is composed of tightly packed cells that provide mechanical support and defense against environmental stressors. Its development is regulated by genetic and hormonal factors during the growth of the grass plant."
