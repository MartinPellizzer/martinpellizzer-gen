    "intro": "Thlaspi alpestre subsp. sylvestre, commonly known as the Alpine rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are usually basal, with a slightly succulent texture. It is adapted to withstand frost and has a deep root system to access moisture in poor soils. This subspecies is often found in mountainous areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
