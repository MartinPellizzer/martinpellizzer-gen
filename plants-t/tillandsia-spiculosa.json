    "intro": "Tillandsia spiculosa, commonly known as the spiky air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, grass-like leaves that are covered in a layer of fine, white trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
