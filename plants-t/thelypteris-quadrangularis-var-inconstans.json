    "intro": "Thelypteris quadrangularis var. inconstans, commonly known as the variable shield fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, rounded lobes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense clumps, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. The leaves are usually dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
