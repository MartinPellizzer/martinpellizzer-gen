    "intro": "Trifolium noricum var. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy wood clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and have a distinctive reddish or purplish hue. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
