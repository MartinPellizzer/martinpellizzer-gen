    "intro": "Taeniophyllum epacridicola, commonly known as the mossy orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree bark or rocky surfaces. The plant has small, delicate leaves and produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its unique botanical features include a short, creeping rhizome and a specialized root system adapted for nutrient absorption from its substrate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
