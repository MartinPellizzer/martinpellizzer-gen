    "intro": "Trifolium reflexum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically glabrous, meaning they lack hair, giving it a smooth texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or red, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
