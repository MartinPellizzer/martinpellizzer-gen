It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments across North America. The plant produces cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its ecological role includes providing habitat for aquatic organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling in wetland ecosystems."
