    "intro": "Thelypteris rupestris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, wiry fronds that typically grow in dense clusters on rocky or shaded substrates. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form extensive colonies. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Thelypteris rupestris is often found in moist, humid environments, contributing to the biodiversity of forest floors and rocky outcrops."
