It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces a single flowering stem that rises above the leaves, bearing numerous small, composite flowers. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other sunny, well-drained areas."
