    "intro": "Trivalvaria macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant has a thick, spongy stem that allows it to float on the water's surface while anchoring itself to the bottom. Its flowers are showy, with white petals that open at night, attracting specific pollinators. Trivalvaria macrophylla plays an important role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its native wetland ecosystems."
