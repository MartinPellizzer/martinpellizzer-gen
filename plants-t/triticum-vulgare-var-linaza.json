    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. linaza, commonly known as linseed, is a variety of wheat that is primarily cultivated for its seeds, which are rich in oil. The plant is an annual herb with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, typical of the grass family. The seeds, which are the main economic product, are harvested when mature and dried. Linseed is also valued for its fibrous husk, which can be used in various industrial applications."
