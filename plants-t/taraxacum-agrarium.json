    "intro": "Taraxacum agrarium, commonly known as the field dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through its wind-borne, parachute-like seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, fields, and along roadsides. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower structure."
