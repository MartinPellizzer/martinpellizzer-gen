It is characterized by its distinctive four-sided pods, which are typically dry and dehiscent, splitting open to release its seeds. The plant is native to various regions in Africa and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Tetragonotheca species are generally shrubs or small trees, with compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. These plants play a role in their ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and animals."
