    "intro": "Tristellateia madagascariensis f. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal tristellateia, is a rare endemic plant species found primarily in the coastal regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in sandy soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and periodic inundation. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are essential to protect this unique botanical feature of Madagascar's coastal ecosystems."
