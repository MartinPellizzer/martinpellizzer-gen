    "intro": "Tilia paucicostata subsp. paucicostata, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed lime, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller and more sharply toothed compared to other lime species. The flowers are fragrant and borne in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
