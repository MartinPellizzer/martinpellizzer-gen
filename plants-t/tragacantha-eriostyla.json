    "intro": "Tragacantha eriostyla, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its thick, fissured bark and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant is known for producing a resinous gum, which has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered with fine hairs, while its fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature. Tragacantha eriostyla is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
