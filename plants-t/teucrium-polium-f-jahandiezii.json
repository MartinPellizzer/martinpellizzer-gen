    "intro": "Teucrium polium f. jahandiezii, commonly known as the Persian germander, is a rare subspecies of the germander plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, narrow leaves, and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Its botanical features include glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which contribute to its aromatic properties. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological traits."
