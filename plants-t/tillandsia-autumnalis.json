    "intro": "Tillandsia autumnalis, commonly known as the Autumn Tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of yellow or orange. Tillandsia autumnalis is known for its ability to thrive in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
