    "intro": "Tillandsia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico and Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal watering, making it a popular choice for low-maintenance indoor gardening."
