    "intro": "Taraxacum bracteatum, commonly known as the bracteate dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, showy yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head composed of numerous tiny seeds with parachute-like structures. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
