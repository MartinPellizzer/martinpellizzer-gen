These plants are characterized by their small, often showy flowers and trifoliate leaves. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Tephrosia species are known for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making them valuable in agricultural systems. Some species are cultivated for their seeds, which are used as a protein source for livestock and humans."
