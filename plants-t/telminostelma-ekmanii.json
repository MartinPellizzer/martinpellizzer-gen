It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a short, woody stem with a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
