    "intro": "Thelypteris pandeorum, commonly known as the pandora shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as tropical forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps it anchor to substrates and absorb moisture. Thelypteris pandeorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
