    "intro": "Triticum striatum, commonly known as the wild wheat or striped wheat, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and long, narrow leaves with a distinctive stripe pattern. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are small and oval, with a tough, inedible husk that must be removed for human consumption. Triticum striatum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
