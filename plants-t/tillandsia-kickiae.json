    "intro": "Tillandsia kickiae, commonly known as the Kicki's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia kickiae is well adapted to humid, shady environments and requires regular misting to thrive."
