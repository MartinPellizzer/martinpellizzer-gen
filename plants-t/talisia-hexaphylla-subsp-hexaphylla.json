    "intro": "Talisia hexaphylla subsp. hexaphylla, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically used in the construction of musical instruments. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
