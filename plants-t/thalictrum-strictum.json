    "intro": "Thalictrum strictum, commonly known as the narrowleaf meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has a slender, upright stem. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and it is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value. Thalictrum strictum is also valued for its ability to support local wildlife and improve soil structure."
