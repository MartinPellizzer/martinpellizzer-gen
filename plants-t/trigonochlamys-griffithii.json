    "intro": "Trigonochlamys griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's trigonochlamys, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its unique floral structure. The plant produces small, delicate flowers with a distinctive three-lobed labellum, which is a key feature in orchid taxonomy. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
