    "intro": "Thelypodiopsis retrofracta, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically succulent, adapted to conserve water in arid conditions. Thelypodiopsis retrofracta is also known for its ability to tolerate extreme temperatures and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought-resistant nature."
