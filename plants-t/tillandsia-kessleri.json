    "intro": "Tillandsia kessleri, commonly known as the Kessleri air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a dense rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity. Tillandsia kessleri is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
