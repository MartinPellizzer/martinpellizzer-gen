    "intro": "Thevetia ovata, commonly known as the yellow oleander, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits containing flat, seed-like structures. It is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic and should be handled with care."
