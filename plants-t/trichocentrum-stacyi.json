    "intro": "Trichocentrum stacyi, commonly known as the Stacy's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are typically broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and efficient water retention. Trichocentrum stacyi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
