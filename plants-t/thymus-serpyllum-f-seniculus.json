It features slender, aromatic stems covered in small, dense leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its foliage is widely used in culinary applications and traditional medicine due to its essential oils and antimicrobial properties.
