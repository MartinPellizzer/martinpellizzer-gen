It features small, needle-like leaves and produces clusters of tiny, pink or purple flowers. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, pungent scent, which is due to the presence of essential oils. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Thymus mariae is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional use in herbal medicine."
