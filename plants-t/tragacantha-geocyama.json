    "intro": "Tragacantha geocyama, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It has adapted to survive in harsh environments through deep root systems and succulent leaves that store water. Tragacantha geocyama is also known for its latex-like sap, which has been used traditionally in various applications."
