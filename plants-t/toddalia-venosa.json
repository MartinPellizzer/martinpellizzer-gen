    "intro": "Toddalia venosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a leathery texture. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting, Toddalia venosa is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
