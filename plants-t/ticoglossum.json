    "intro": "Ticoglossum, commonly known as the hawksbeard, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Compositae. These plants are characterized by their bright yellow or orange composite flowers, which resemble a hawk's beak, hence the common name. Ticoglossum species are typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. They have basal leaves that are often lobed or toothed, and their flowering stems are usually unbranched. The genus includes several species, such as Ticoglossum hybridum, which is known for its showy, daisy-like blooms."
