    "intro": "Triticum asperum, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild relative of wheat that belongs to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its rough, bristly texture and is typically found in temperate regions. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with awned lemmas, which are distinctive features in its botanical description. It has narrow, linear leaves and is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability to various soil types. Triticum asperum is also of interest in agricultural research for its potential role in breeding programs for improved wheat varieties."
