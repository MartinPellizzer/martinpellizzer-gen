    "intro": "Turpethum, commonly known as the wild turpentine bush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rutaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that produce a turpentine-like resin. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in inflorescences and bloom in the spring. Turpethum is often found in wetland habitats and is adapted to thrive in moist, sandy soils."
