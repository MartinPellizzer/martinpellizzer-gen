    "intro": "Thuja orientalis f. sieboldii, commonly known as the Japanese thuja or Siebold's thuja, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen conifer with a dense, pyramidal shape. It features scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green female cones, which release wind-pollinated seeds. It is native to Japan and is well-suited for rock gardens or as a specimen plant due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal. Its foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, making it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
