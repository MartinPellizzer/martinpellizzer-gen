    "intro": "Triticum persicum, commonly known as Persian wheat, is a species of grass native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets. The plant produces small, beige to brown grains that are typically harvested when mature. While not as widely cultivated as common wheat, it has been used historically in traditional agriculture and local cuisines. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both ecological and agricultural studies."
