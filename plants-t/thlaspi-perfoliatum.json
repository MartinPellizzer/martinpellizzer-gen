    "intro": "Thlaspi perfoliatum, commonly known as mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and riverbanks. It produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. Thlaspi perfoliatum is also known for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it a potential candidate for phytoremediation."
