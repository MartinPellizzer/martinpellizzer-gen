    "intro": "Thunbergia fragrans var. heterophylla, commonly known as the fragrant thunbergia, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is popular in gardens and as a houseplant. The varietal form, heterophylla, is distinguished by its variable leaf shape and size compared to the typical variety."
