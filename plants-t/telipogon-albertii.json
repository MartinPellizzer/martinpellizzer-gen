    "intro": "Telipogon albertii, commonly known as the Albert's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, hairy growth form and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Telipogon albertii is considered endangered."
