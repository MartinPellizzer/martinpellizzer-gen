    "intro": "Tillandsia apicroides, commonly known as the purple rosette air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a dense, water-holding cup at the center. The leaves are typically narrow, grass-like, and covered in a fine layer of trichomes that help absorb moisture from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity."
