    "intro": "Tragacantha rhizantha, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its deep root system, which allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand periods of drought. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs to reduce water loss. The plant is also valued for its latex-like sap, which has been used traditionally in various medicinal applications."
