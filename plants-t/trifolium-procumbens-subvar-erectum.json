    "intro": "Trifolium procumbens subvar. erectum, commonly known as upright white clover, is a low-growing leguminous plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in dense clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It has a shallow root system and is often found in lawns, pastures, and disturbed soils. This variety is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
