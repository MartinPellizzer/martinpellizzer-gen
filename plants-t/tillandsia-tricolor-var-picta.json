    "intro": "Tillandsia tricolor var. picta, commonly known as the Painted Air Plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage that displays a range of hues including red, orange, and yellow, which intensify under bright light. The plant does not require soil, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves via a process called foliar uptake. It thrives in humid environments with good air circulation and indirect sunlight. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
