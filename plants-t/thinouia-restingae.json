    "intro": "Thinouia restingae, commonly known as the Restinga thistle, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of Brazil. It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the restinga ecosystem. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
