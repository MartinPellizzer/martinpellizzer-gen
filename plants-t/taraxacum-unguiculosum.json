    "intro": "Taraxacum unguiculosum, commonly known as the Mexican dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers and heart-shaped basal leaves. Native to Mexico and parts of Central America, it thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem with milky sap, and its seeds are dispersed by wind via a feathery pappus. It is often considered a weed but has some medicinal uses in traditional herbal practices."
