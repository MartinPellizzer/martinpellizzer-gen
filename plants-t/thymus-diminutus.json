    "intro": "Thymus diminutus, commonly known as dwarf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a dense mat-like growth habit. The plant produces tiny pink or white flowers in the spring, which are clustered in whorls along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its compact size and fragrant foliage, it is often used in culinary and medicinal applications."
