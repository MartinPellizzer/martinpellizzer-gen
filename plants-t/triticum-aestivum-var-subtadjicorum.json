    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. subtadjicorum, commonly known as the subtropical wheat, is a variant of common wheat adapted to warmer climates. It exhibits shorter stature and earlier maturity compared to standard wheat varieties, making it suitable for cultivation in subtropical regions. The plant has a robust root system that helps it withstand drought conditions. Its grain is typically smaller and has a higher protein content than conventional wheat. This variety is of interest for agricultural research due to its potential in climate-resilient farming."
