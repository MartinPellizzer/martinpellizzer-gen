    "intro": "Trisetum umbratile, commonly known as the shade grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, dark green leaves that often curl inward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale green spikelets that are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Trisetum umbratile is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
