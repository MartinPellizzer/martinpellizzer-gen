    "intro": "Thismia clandestina, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and green leaves, relying entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. The plant produces small, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in the late summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
