    "intro": "Thelypteris decussata var. brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus native to South America. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features fronds that are often divided into segments, with a distinctive shield-shaped appearance on the underside. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species. The plant's botanical characteristics make it an important component of tropical and subtropical ecosystems."
