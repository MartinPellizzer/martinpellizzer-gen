    "intro": "Taraxacum subspathulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow flowering head that develops into a puffy white pappus. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces a milky sap that contains various latex compounds, which can be toxic to some animals. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings."
