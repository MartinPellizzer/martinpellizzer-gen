    "intro": "Tinus angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf tinus, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and linear, growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
