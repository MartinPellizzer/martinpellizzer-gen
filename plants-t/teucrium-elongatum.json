    "intro": "Teucrium elongatum, commonly known as long-stemmed germander, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, slender stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branched and covered with fine hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and have a grayish-green color due to a dense covering of trichomes. Its small, tubular flowers are typically arranged in spikes and bloom in shades of blue or violet, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
