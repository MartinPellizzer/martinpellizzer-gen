    "intro": "Taraxacum amborum, commonly known as the Italian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features a basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves that are spoon-shaped and gradually become more lanceolate toward the top. The plant produces a single, tall, yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy white pappus, aiding in wind pollination. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional remedies for digestive and respiratory ailments."
