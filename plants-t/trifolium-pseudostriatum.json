It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. Trifolium pseudostriatum is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant for improving soil fertility."
