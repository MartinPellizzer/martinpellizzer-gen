It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with closely spaced, toothed leaflets and a creeping rhizome system. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found on rocks or in moist, shaded forest floors. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
