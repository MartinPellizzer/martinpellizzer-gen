    "intro": "Tapiphyllum cistifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tapiphyllum, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
