    "intro": "Tulipa valerii, commonly known as the Valerian tulip, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Tulipa valerii is known for its hardiness and ability to naturalize over time, creating dense clusters of blooms."
