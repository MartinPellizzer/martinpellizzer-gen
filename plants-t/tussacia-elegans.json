    "intro": "Tussacia elegans, commonly known as the elegant tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Tussacia elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardy, low-maintenance nature."
