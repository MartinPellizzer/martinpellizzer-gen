    "intro": "Tasmannia rosea, commonly known as the Tasmanian pepperberry, is a flowering plant native to the cool, moist forests of Tasmania. It is a member of the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible and have a peppery, citrusy flavor. Its leaves are glossy and lance-shaped, and it typically grows as an understory shrub. Tasmannia rosea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional Aboriginal cuisine."
