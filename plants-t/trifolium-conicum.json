    "intro": "Trifolium conicum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Trifolium conicum is a perennial herb that plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
