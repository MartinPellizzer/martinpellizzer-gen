It features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a hollow, hairy pappus-equipped seed dispersal mechanism. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family and is closely related to other dandelion species."
