    "intro": "Tulipa whittallii, commonly known as the Whittall's tulip, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a distinctive red or purple stripe along the outer edge. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is a perennial herb with narrow, strap-like leaves and is known for its ornamental value in gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
