    "intro": "Tillandsia macrochlamys, commonly known as the giant air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces striking orange to red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia macrochlamys is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
