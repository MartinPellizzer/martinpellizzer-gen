    "intro": "Tridophyllum leucocarpum, commonly known as the white-fruited mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, white, fleshy berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its roots, called haustoria, penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. Tridophyllum leucocarpum is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions where suitable host trees are available."
