    "intro": "Thalictrum sachalinense, commonly known as the Sakhalin meadow rue, is a flowering plant native to the forests of Sakhalin Island and parts of northeastern Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Thalictrum sachalinense is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
