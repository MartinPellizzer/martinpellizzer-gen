    "intro": "Thalictrum dichotomum, commonly known as the forked meadow-rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It features slender, branched stems that often grow in clusters, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are alternate along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded habitats. Thalictrum dichotomum is valued in gardens for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in woodland environments."
