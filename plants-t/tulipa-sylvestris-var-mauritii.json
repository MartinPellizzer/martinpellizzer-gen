    "intro": "Tulipa sylvestris var. mauritii, commonly known as the Mauritius tulip, is a striking perennial bulbous plant native to the island of Mauritius. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange and yellow, often with a contrasting black eye. The plant produces strap-like, grassy leaves and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is well adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat, though it can be cultivated in other regions with careful attention to its specific needs. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is a key component of the local flora of Mauritius."
