    "intro": "Torenia obtusa, commonly known as the broadleaf torenia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, broad leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an annual or herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects, and it is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal. The plant's botanical features make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking shade-tolerant, low-maintenance plants."
