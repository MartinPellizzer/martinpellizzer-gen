    "intro": "Trifolium melilotus-altissimum, commonly known as the tall melilot clover, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its fragrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients. Its seeds are also used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
