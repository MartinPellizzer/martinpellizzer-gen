    "intro": "Thelypteris malabariensis, commonly known as the Malabar water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint blue glow in the dark, a unique trait among ferns. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks, where it forms dense mats. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family."
