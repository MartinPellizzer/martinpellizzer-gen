    "intro": "Trifolium triaristatum, commonly known as the three-lobed clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Trifolium triaristatum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological and agricultural contexts."
