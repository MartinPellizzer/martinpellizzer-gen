    "intro": "Tectaria martinicensis var. salicifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf tectaria, is a fern native to the Caribbean, particularly Dominica and Martinique. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. This variety is distinguished by its broad, salicifolia-like leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance compared to other Tectaria species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories where it contributes to the biodiversity of tropical ecosystems."
