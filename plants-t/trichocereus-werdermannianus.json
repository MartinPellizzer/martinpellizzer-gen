    "intro": "Trichocereus werdermannianus, commonly known as the \"Moon cactus\" or \"Desert rose,\" is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can grow up to several meters in height, covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces striking white or pink flowers during the night, which are pollinated by bats and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Trichocereus werdermannianus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit."
