    "intro": "Tylecodon ectypus, commonly known as the Narrow-leaved Iceplant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems covered in small, blue-green leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
