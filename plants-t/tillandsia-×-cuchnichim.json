    "intro": "Tillandsia \u00d7 cuchnichim, commonly known as the silver star tillandsia, is a hybrid epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, white trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and good air circulation. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in terrariums."
