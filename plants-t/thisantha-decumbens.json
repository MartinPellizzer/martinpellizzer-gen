    "intro": "Thisantha decumbens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically oval and slightly hairy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Thisantha decumbens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
