    "intro": "Tragacantha brachyptera, commonly known as the short-winged tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces a resinous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are trifoliate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in dry, rocky soils. Tragacantha brachyptera is often found in open woodlands and scrublands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
