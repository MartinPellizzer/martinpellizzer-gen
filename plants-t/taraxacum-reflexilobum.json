    "intro": "Taraxacum reflexilobum, commonly known as the reflexed leaf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are reflexed or curled backward at the edges. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed head known as a pappus. It is typically found in moist meadows and along stream banks in temperate regions. Taraxacum reflexilobum is often mistaken for other dandelion species due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its unique leaf morphology."
