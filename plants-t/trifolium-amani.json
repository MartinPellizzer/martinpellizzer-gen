    "intro": "Trifolium amani, commonly known as the Amani clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. Trifolium amani thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility."
