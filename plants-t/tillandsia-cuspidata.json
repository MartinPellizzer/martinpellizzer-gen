    "intro": "Tillandsia cuspidata, commonly known as the bristly air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, often emerging from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia cuspidata is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
