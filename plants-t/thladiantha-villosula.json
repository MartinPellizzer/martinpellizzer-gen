    "intro": "Thladiantha villosula, commonly known as the hairy gobernadora, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, followed by orange to red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
