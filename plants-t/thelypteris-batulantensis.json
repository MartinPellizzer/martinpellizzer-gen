    "intro": "Thelypteris batulantensis, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into multiple segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new growth from the base, contributing to its spreading habit. The fronds are usually evergreen, with a leathery texture and a distinctive appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
