    "intro": "Tuberosa amica, commonly known as the friendly tuber, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy underground stems called tubers, which store nutrients and water. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The tubers are not only ornamental but also have been used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
