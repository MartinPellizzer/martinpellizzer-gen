    "intro": "Tillandsia fulgens, commonly known as the fiery tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescences that can range from red to orange, giving it its common name. Its leaves are usually narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air. Tillandsia fulgens requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
