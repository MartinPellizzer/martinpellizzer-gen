    "intro": "Trifolium repens var. atropurpureum, commonly known as purple clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically purple-tinged on the underside, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in nitrogen fixation in agricultural settings."
