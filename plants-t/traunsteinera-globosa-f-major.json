    "intro": "Traunsteinera globosa f. major, commonly known as the giant traunsteinera, is a unique plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The plant has a woody stem with a thick, fibrous bark, and its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to the high-altitude environment. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its striking appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
