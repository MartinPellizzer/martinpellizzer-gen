    "intro": "Thalictrum simplex subsp. tenuifolium, commonly known as slenderleaf meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are narrow and finely divided, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces upright clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
