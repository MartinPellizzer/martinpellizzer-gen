    "intro": "Taraxacum officinale var. ungulatum, commonly known as the spoonleaf dandelion, is a variant of the common dandelion characterized by its distinctive spoon-shaped leaves. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy white seed head, which is dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are typically broader and more elongated compared to the standard dandelion, giving it a unique appearance. The species is known for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
