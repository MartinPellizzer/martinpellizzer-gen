    "intro": "Taraxacum intumescens, commonly known as the giant dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is characterized by its large, fleshy, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces a tall stem with a single, bright yellow flower head that develops into a white, feathery pappus for wind dispersal. Its robust growth and distinctive appearance make it a notable species in its native habitats. Taraxacum intumescens is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in sunny conditions."
