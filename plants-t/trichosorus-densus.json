    "intro": "Trichosorus densus, commonly known as the dense hair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, wiry fronds covered in fine, short hairs, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often thick and robust, allowing it to anchor itself in challenging substrates. Trichosorus densus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
