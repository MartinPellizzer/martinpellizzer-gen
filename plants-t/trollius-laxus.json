    "intro": "Trollius laxus, commonly known as the meadow buttercup, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow, cup-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and wetlands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, hairy fruits that disperse its seeds. Trollius laxus is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is also important in ecological studies due to its role in supporting pollinators."
