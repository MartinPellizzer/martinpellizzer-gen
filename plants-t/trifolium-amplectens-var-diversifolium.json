    "intro": "Trifolium amplectens var. diversifolium, commonly known as the variable clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets that vary in shape and size, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop or for ornamental purposes."
