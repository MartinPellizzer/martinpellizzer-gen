    "intro": "Thalictrum majus var. elatum, commonly known as the tall meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adorned with compound leaves that are finely divided and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. Thalictrum majus var. elatum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
