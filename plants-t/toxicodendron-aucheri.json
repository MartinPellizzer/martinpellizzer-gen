It is characterized by its compound leaves, typically consisting of three leaflets, which are often hairy and have a reddish or purplish hue. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by red, fleshy berries. It is native to regions of the Middle East and Central Asia, where it thrives in rocky or arid environments. Like other members of its genus, it contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation in humans."
