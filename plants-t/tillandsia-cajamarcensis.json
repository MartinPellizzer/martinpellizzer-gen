    "intro": "Tillandsia cajamarcensis, commonly known as the Cajamarca air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of northern Peru. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of white or pale purple. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
