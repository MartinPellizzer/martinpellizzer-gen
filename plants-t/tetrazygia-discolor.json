It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Tetrazygia discolor is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
