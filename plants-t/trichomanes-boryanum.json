    "intro": "Trichomanes boryanum, commonly known as the Boryan fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with fronds that are usually dark green and leathery. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Trichomanes boryanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
