    "intro": "Tillandsia hutchisonii, commonly known as the Hutchison's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers. This species is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
