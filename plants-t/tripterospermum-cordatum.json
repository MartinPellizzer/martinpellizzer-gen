    "intro": "Tripterospermum cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf tripterospermum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and thrives in well-drained soils. It produces small, orange-red fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, persistent capsule. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
