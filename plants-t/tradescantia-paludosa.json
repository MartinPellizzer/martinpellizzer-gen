    "intro": "Tradescantia paludosa, commonly known as marsh spiderwort, is a herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the eastern United States. It features upright stems that produce clusters of small, three-petaled, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its moist habitat. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
