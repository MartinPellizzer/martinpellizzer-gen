    "intro": "Trichaurus ericoides, commonly known as the heath leek, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western regions of North America. It typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils found in heathlands and open woodlands. The plant features small, dark green leaves that are clustered at the base, and it produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in the spring. Trichaurus ericoides is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats."
