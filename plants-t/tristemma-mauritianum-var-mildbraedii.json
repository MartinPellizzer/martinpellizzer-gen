    "intro": "Tristemma mauritianum var. mildbraedii, commonly known as the Mauritius tristema, is a rare endemic species native to the Mascarene Islands. It is a shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture and a bluish-green hue. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
