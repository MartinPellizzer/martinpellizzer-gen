It is a shrub characterized by its succulent, often spiny stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its fleshy leaves help store water, enabling it to survive in regions with low rainfall. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
