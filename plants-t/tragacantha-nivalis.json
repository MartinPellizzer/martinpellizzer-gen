    "intro": "Tragacantha nivalis, commonly known as the snowtragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its perennial growth habit and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and has a deep root system to access moisture in rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Tragacantha nivalis is also known for its medicinal properties, with its resin being used in traditional herbal remedies."
