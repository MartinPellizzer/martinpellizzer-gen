    "intro": "Timaeosia rupestris, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in arid conditions. Timaeosia rupestris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
