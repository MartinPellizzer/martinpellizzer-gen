    "intro": "Thymus carolinianus, commonly known as Carolina thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It produces small, pink to purple flowers and has aromatic, fuzzy leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or borders. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The essential oils extracted from its leaves contain thymol, which gives it antimicrobial properties."
