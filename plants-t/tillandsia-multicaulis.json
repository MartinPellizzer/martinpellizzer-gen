    "intro": "Tillandsia multicaulis, commonly known as the silver vellum tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a unique silvery appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps to collect and retain moisture from the air. Tillandsia multicaulis is popular among succulent and air plant enthusiasts for its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
