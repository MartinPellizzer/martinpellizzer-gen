    "intro": "Trifolium agrarium var. subsessile, commonly known as the slender clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval to lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This variety is noted for its low-growing habit and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
