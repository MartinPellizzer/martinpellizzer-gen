    "intro": "Thelypteris nitidula, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sporangia on the undersides of the fronds. Thelypteris nitidula is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants in humid, temperate climates."
