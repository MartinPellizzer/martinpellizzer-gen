    "intro": "Triticum multiflorum, commonly known as wild wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant produces achenes, which are dry, one-seeded fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in fields. Botanically, it is closely related to cultivated wheat species and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
