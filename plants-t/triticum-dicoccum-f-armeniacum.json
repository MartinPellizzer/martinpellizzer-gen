    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum f. armeniacum, commonly known as Armenian spelt, is a wild wheat species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, dark-colored grains that are typically harvested when dry. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that bear the edible grains. It is closely related to other spelt wheat varieties and is valued for its high nutritional content and potential use in ancient grain products. Due to its wild origin, it has limited cultivation but is studied for its genetic diversity and resilience to environmental stress."
