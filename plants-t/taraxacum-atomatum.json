    "intro": "Taraxacum atomatum, commonly known as the miniature dandelion, is a small herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its tiny, clustered yellow flowers and a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its unique morphology, including its miniature size and clustered inflorescence, makes it distinct from other dandelion species. Taraxacum atomatum is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, contributing to its ecological adaptability."
