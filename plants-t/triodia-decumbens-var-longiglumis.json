    "intro": "Triodia decumbens var. longiglumis, commonly known as the long glume triodia, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit and produces dense, fibrous tussocks that help stabilize sandy soils. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brown flowers. It is well adapted to drought and heat, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in harsh environmental conditions. This variety is often found in coastal dunes and inland sandplains, contributing to the ecological diversity of these ecosystems."
