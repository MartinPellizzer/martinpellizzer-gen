The flowers are typically blue to purple in color, with five pointed lobes, and bloom in early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings."
