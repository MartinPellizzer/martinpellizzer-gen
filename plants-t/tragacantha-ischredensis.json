    "intro": "Tragacantha ischredensis, commonly known as the Armenian tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pods containing angular, yellow seeds. It is valued for its gum, which is used in traditional medicine and as a natural thickening agent. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered in some regions."
