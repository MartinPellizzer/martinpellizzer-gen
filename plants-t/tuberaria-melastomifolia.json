    "intro": "Tuberaria melastomifolia, commonly known as the purple-flowered ground orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a low-growing habit with fleshy, tuberous roots that store nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple and pink, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are oval and slightly hairy, contributing to its overall ornamental appeal. Tuberaria melastomifolia is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained environments."
