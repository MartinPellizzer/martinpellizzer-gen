    "intro": "Torrubia opposita, commonly known as the red-barked torrubia, is a deciduous shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive red, fissured bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during late spring, which are followed by orange-red, winged fruits. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in scrubland and rocky habitats. Torrubia opposita is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
