    "intro": "Thalictrum flavum var. nigricans, commonly known as the black-stemmed meadow rue, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, branched stems that are typically tinged with purple or black, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided leaflets that create a lacy effect, and it prefers moist, shady woodland habitats. Thalictrum flavum var. nigricans is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and early blooming habit."
