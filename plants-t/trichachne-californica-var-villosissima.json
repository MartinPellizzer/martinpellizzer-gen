    "intro": "Trichachne californica var. villosissima, commonly known as California hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It features slender, grass-like blades with a dense, tufted growth habit and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant has fine, silky hairs covering its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
