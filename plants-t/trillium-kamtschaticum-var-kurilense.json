    "intro": "Trillium kamtschaticum var. kurilense, commonly known as the Kuril trillium, is a rare perennial herb native to the Russian Far East and parts of the Kuril Islands. It belongs to the Trilliaceae family and is characterized by its three large, waxy, greenish-white petals and three sepals that resemble leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, preferring rich, organic soil. It produces a single, erect stem with a single flower that blooms in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
