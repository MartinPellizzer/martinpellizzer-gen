    "intro": "Terminalia litoralis var. tomentella, commonly known as the mangrove apple or sea apple, is a variant of the mangrove species native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that thrives in brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests. The plant is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. This variant is adapted to saltwater conditions and plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
