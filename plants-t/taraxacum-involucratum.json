    "intro": "Taraxacum involucratum, commonly known as the woolly dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a tall, hairy stem that bears a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a dense cluster of disk florets, which develop into a spherical seed head with parachute-like seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and garden beds. The plant is a member of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower structure and wind-dispersed seeds."
