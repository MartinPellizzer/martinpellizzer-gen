It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by pods that contain several seeds. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its mucilage-rich sap, which has been used in traditional medicine and as a natural thickening agent."
