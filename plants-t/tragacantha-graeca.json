    "intro": "Tragacantha graeca, commonly known as Greek tragacanth, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody, branched stem and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pods containing lens-shaped seeds. Tragacantha graeca is notable for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments due to its deep root system and drought tolerance. Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of gum has contributed to its significance in botanical studies."
