    "intro": "Tragacantha humistrata, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in terminal spikes, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested, making it a defensive adaptation against herbivores. Tragacantha humistrata plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local wildlife in its ecosystem."
