    "intro": "Tigridia huyanae, commonly known as the Huyana tiger flower, is a rare and striking member of the Iridaceae family native to the high Andean regions of Peru. This perennial herb features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, with a distinctive black spot at the base of each petal. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seed pods that split open to release its small, black seeds. Due to its limited habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
