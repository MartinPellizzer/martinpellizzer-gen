    "intro": "Triodia vella, commonly known as the slender spinifex, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with wiry, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Triodia vella is well adapted to drought and salt-laden soils, making it a common component of coastal and inland shrublands. Its dense growth habit provides habitat and erosion control in sandy and degraded landscapes."
