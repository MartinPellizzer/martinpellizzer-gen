    "intro": "Taraxacum oxoniense, commonly known as the Oxford dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, ridged stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides. Taraxacum oxoniense is a perennial plant that thrives in temperate climates and is relatively easy to cultivate."
