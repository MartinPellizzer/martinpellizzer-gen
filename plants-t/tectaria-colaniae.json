    "intro": "Tectaria colaniae, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, scale-like structures. The plant is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. Tectaria colaniae is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
