    "intro": "Tragacantha podoloba, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces a distinctive pod-like fruit that contains seeds surrounded by a sticky, resinous substance. This resin, known as tragacanth, has been historically used in medicine and as a natural thickening agent. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils."
