It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces numerous small, yellowish flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically basal, alternate, and have a rough, hairy texture.
