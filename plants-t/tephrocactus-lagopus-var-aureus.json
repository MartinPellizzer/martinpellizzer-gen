    "intro": "Tephrocactus lagopus var. aureus, commonly known as the golden-tailed cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, golden-yellow spines, which give it its common name. Its flowers, typically yellow or orange, bloom in late summer and are tubular in shape, attracting pollinators like bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
