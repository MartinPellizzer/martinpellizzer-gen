    "intro": "Tillaea verticillaris, commonly known as the spiral saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of tightly packed, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white to grayish hairs. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers in a spiral arrangement, which is a distinctive feature of the species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. Tillaea verticillaris is often found in mountainous and tundra habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
