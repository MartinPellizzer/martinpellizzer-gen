    "intro": "Trisetum striatum, commonly known as the stripe grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with a distinctive striped appearance on the leaf blades. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, two-lobed spikelets. Trisetum striatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage."
