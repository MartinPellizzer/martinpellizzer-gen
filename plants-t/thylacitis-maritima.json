    "intro": "Thylacitis maritima, commonly known as the coastal thylacitis, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Thylacitis maritima is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
