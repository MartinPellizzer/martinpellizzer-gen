    "intro": "Trifolium arvense var. pulchellum, commonly known as the purple clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in early spring. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in agriculture as a forage crop. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil fertility."
