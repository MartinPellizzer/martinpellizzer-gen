    "intro": "Triticum turgidum var. griseomegalopolitanum, commonly known as the gray wheat, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its robust growth habit and distinctive grayish-blue glumes that cover the spikelets. This variety is notable for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in diverse environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with leathery, awned bracts. It is of particular interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to modern wheat breeding programs."
