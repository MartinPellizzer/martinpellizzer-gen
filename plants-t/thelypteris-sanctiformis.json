    "intro": "Thelypteris sanctiformis, commonly known as the sacred fern, is a species of polypod fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of brownish hairs. Thelypteris sanctiformis is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its cultural significance in traditional practices."
