It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant features dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its bracts are modified leaves that often appear as small, rounded structures around the flowers. This plant is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky habitats and is often used in succulent gardens for its ornamental value."
