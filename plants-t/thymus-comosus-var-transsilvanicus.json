    "intro": "Thymus comosus var. transsilvanicus, commonly known as Transylvanian thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Carpathian Mountains. It features small, gray-green leaves and produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, slightly medicinal scent, which comes from essential oils found in its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
