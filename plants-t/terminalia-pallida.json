    "intro": "Terminalia pallida, commonly known as the pale terminalia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Combretaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in natural habitats. Terminalia pallida is often found in dry, wooded areas and is adapted to seasonal rainfall patterns."
