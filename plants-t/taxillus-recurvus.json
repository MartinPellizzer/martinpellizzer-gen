    "intro": "Taxillus recurvus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain toxic compounds, making them harmful to mammals and birds. Its life cycle involves seeds being dispersed by birds that consume the berries, leading to new infections on suitable host trees. Taxillus recurvus plays a role in ecological interactions, influencing the health and diversity of forest ecosystems."
