It features small, aromatic leaves that are slightly serrated, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, pink or white flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications."
