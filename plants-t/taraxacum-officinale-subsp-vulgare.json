    "intro": "Taraxacum officinale subsp. vulgare, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flower head. It produces a yellow composite flower that develops into a spherical seed head with parachute-like seeds. The plant is widespread across temperate regions and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed soils. It has a taproot system that allows it to persist through adverse conditions. The species is notable for its medicinal uses and its role in supporting pollinators."
