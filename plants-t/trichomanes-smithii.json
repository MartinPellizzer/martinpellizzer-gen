    "intro": "Trichomanes smithii, commonly known as the Smith's water hawksbeard, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of North America. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky crevices, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichomanes smithii is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
