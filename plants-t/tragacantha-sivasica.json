    "intro": "Tragacantha sivasica, commonly known as the Sivasica tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces a resinous gum, similar to other members of the tragacanth genus, which has been used historically in traditional medicine. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and scrublands. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
