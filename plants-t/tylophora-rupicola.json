    "intro": "Tylophora rupicola, commonly known as the rock tylophora, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers, which are followed by elongated, woody fruits. It typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
