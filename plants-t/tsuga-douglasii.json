    "intro": "Tsuga douglasii, commonly known as the Douglas fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its tall, conical shape and needle-like leaves that are blue-green in color. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against forest fires. The Douglas fir is valued for its strong, durable wood and plays an important role in forest ecosystems."
