    "intro": "Tillandsia hotteana, commonly known as the Hotteana air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil for growth, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant features rosette-shaped foliage with a striking silver-green coloration, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink. It is well adapted to aerial environments, with specialized trichomes on its leaves that help in water absorption. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
