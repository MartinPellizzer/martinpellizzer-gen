    "intro": "Trisetum neglectum, commonly known as the neglected trisetum, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. Trisetum neglectum is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
