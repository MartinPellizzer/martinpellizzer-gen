    "intro": "Taihangia, commonly known as the Taihang mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic plant found in the Taihang Mountains of China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptation to harsh mountainous environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and specialized for nutrient absorption. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Taihangia is considered a vulnerable species."
