    "intro": "Thelypteris rhachiflexuosa, commonly known as the flexible wood fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that often have a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are usually creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
