    "intro": "Taraxacum sterneri, commonly known as the Stern's dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the dandelion family, Asteraceae, and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, showy yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head with numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and rocky areas, and is often found in regions with well-drained soil. Taraxacum sterneri is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its resilience in arid environments."
