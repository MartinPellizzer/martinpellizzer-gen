    "intro": "Tilia americana subsp. heterophylla, commonly known as the American basswood or white basswood, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that vary in size and shape depending on the environment, a trait that gives it its subspecies name \"heterophylla.\" The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and wildlife."
