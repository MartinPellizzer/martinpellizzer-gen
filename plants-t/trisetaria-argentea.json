    "intro": "Trisetaria argentea, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and wetlands. Trisetaria argentea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
