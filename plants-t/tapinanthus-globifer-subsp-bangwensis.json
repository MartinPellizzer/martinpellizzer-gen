    "intro": "Tapinanthus globifer subsp. bangwensis, commonly known as the Bangwensis dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a sprawling, vine-like growth habit. It is often found parasitizing various shrubs and trees in its native habitat. Due to its unique parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
