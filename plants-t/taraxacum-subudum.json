    "intro": "Taraxacum subudum, commonly known as the subudum dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk flowers, which develop into fluffy white seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in meadows and disturbed soils. The plant is noted for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
