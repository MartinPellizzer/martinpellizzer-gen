    "intro": "Telis filipes, commonly known as the slender feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are often overlooked due to their subtle nature. Telis filipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
