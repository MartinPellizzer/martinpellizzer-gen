    "intro": "Telipogon intis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Australia and New Guinea. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its unique morphology and habitat make it highly sensitive to environmental changes, contributing to its endangered status. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Telipogon intis is a subject of significant botanical interest and conservation efforts."
