    "intro": "Tulipa cuspidata, commonly known as the Persian tulip, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a distinctive yellow or orange stripe. The plant produces showy, single or double blooms in early spring, typically between March and May. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a dense rosette at the base. Tulipa cuspidata is well-suited for rock gardens and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
