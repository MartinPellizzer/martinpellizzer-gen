It has a distinctive appearance with a thick, fleshy stem and large, leathery leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant is characterized by its ability to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Tonningia foecunda is popular as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
