    "intro": "Thymus praecox subsp. hesperites, commonly known as the Texas thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features aromatic, narrow leaves and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to arid landscapes. The subspecies is closely related to other thyme species but is distinguished by its unique geographic distribution and floral characteristics."
