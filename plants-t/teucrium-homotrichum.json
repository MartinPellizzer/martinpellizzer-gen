    "intro": "Teucrium homotrichum, commonly known as blue germander, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and drought tolerance."
