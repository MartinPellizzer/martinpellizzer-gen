    "intro": "Thlaspi humifusum, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, reducing water loss in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pink, arranged in clusters and blooming in early summer. Thlaspi humifusum is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
