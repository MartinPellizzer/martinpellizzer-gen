    "intro": "Terebinthus pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's terebinth, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes species known for their aromatic resins. The plant is characterized by its small, simple leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are dry, dehiscent capsules that release seeds upon maturity. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Terebinthus pringlei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
