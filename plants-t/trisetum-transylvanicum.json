    "intro": "Trisetum transylvanicum, commonly known as the Transylvanian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a tufted growth habit. Trisetum transylvanicum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
