    "intro": "Tillandsia caricifolia, commonly known as the \"Bull's Horn\" air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding structure. Its foliage is typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Tillandsia caricifolia produces striking orange or red inflorescences that bloom in the spring."
