    "intro": "Trifolium striatum var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf white clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to kidney-shaped leaflets, often with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, lawns, and disturbed habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated as a ground cover or in mixed flower beds."
