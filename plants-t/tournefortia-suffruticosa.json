    "intro": "Tournefortia suffruticosa, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in areas with high saline exposure. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in warm climates."
