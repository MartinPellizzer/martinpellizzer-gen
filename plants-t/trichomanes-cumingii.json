    "intro": "Trichomanes cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's huperzia, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Trichomanes cumingii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
