    "intro": "Tillandsia velutina, commonly known as the velvet tillandsia, is an epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, adding ornamental value. It requires minimal soil contact and is often grown as a hanging plant or mounted on bark. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
