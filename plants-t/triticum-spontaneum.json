    "intro": "Triticum spontaneum, commonly known as wild wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and spikelet-based flowers. This plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of climates, including semi-arid environments. Its seeds are small and hardy, allowing for effective seed dispersal and survival in harsh conditions. Triticum spontaneum is considered an important wild relative of cultivated wheat, offering genetic diversity for breeding programs."
