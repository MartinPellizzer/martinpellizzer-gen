    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 pseudostellata, commonly known as the hybrid linden tree, is a deciduous tree belonging to the Tiliaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Tilia cordata (small-leaf linden) and Tilia platyphyllos (large-leaf linden), exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The tree has heart-shaped leaves that are typically larger than those of Tilia cordata but smaller than Tilia platyphyllos. Its flowers are fragrant and clustered, producing nectar that attracts bees and other pollinators. The tree is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in urban landscapes for its shade and aesthetic appeal."
