It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically arranged in clusters of three, with the central leaflet being the longest. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red, fuzzy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is commonly found in the eastern United States. This subspecies is known for its potent urushiol oil, which can cause severe skin irritation in humans."
