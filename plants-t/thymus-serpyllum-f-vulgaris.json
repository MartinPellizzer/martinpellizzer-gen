It features small, fragrant leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces pink or purple flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. The leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its aromatic properties and therapeutic uses."
