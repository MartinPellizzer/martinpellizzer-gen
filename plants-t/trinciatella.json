It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Trinciatella is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. It is sometimes considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to thrive in various soil types."
