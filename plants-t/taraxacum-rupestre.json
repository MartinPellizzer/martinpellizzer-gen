    "intro": "Taraxacum rupestre, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in harsh, arid environments. It produces a yellow flower head that blooms in spring, followed by a wind-dispersed seed head. Its robust root system allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions, making it a resilient species in mountainous regions."
