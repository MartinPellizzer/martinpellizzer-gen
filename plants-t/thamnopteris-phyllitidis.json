    "intro": "Thamnopteris phyllitidis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thamnopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in humid forest understories. Its rhizomes are typically short and thick, anchoring it to rocky substrates. Thamnopteris phyllitidis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
