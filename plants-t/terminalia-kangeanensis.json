    "intro": "Terminalia kangeanensis, commonly known as the Kangean terminalia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Combretaceae. It is native to the island of Kangean in Indonesia, where it grows in lowland and hill forest habitats. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruits are follicles that split open to release seeds, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem as a food source for various wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
