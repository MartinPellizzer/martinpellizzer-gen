    "intro": "Tridophyllum rivale, commonly known as the water fern, is a rare and elusive plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is a member of the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant is often found growing on rocks or in crevices near streams and waterfalls, where it benefits from the constant moisture. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of its fronds, and it relies on spores for propagation rather than seeds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Tridophyllum rivale is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
