    "intro": "Tillandsia walter-tillii, commonly known as the Walter Tillandsia, is a species of air plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of Central America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. This epiphytic plant absorbs moisture and nutrients through its specialized leaves rather than through soil. Its rosette-shaped foliage is covered in dense, fuzzy trichomes that aid in water retention. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and purple, making it a visually striking specimen."
