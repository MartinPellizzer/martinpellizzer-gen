    "intro": "Trachypogon truncatus, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that have a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides. Trachypogon truncatus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
