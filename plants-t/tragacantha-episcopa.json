    "intro": "Tragacantha episcopa, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. The plant is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. Its most notable feature is the production of a viscous resin, known as tragacanth, which has been used historically in medicine and as a binding agent. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots and a thick cuticle to reduce water loss."
