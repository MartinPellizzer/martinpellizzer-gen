    "intro": "Tinus bakeriana, commonly known as the Baker's tinus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is a small shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tinus bakeriana is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
