It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmate leaves. The tree produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in winter, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils and can grow up to 15 meters in height. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
