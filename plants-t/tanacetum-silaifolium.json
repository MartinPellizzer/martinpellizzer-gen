    "intro": "Tanacetum silaifolium, commonly known as the silaifolium tansy, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
