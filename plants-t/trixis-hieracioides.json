    "intro": "Trixis hieracioides, commonly known as the desert hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with silver-gray, hairy leaves adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its small yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Trixis hieracioides is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions due to its compact growth and deep root system."
