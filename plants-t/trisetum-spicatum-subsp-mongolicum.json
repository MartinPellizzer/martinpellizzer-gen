    "intro": "Trisetum spicatum subsp. mongolicum, commonly known as Mongolian hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences. This subspecies is adapted to grow in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in marginal environments."
