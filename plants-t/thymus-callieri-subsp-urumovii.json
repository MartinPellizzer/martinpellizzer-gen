    "intro": "Thymus callieri subsp. urumovii, commonly known as the Urumov's thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic, small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
