    "intro": "Thermophila emarginata, commonly known as the marginated thermophyte, is a rare flowering plant native to specific high-altitude regions. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in mountainous areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive notched base, and its flowers are small, white to pale yellow. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Thermophila emarginata is considered endangered in many regions."
