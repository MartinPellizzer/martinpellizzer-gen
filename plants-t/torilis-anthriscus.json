    "intro": "Torilis anthriscus, commonly known as lesser celandine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has smooth, waxy leaves that are often mistaken for those of true celandine. It thrives in moist, shaded areas and is often found in woodland floors and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it both a valuable early-season pollinator resource and a potential weed in cultivated gardens."
