    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 arcanus, commonly known as the hybrid thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is a cross between Thymus serpyllum (wild thyme) and Thymus praecox (creeping thyme), resulting in a plant with dense, low-growing foliage. The leaves are aromatic, often used in culinary and medicinal applications, and the plant produces small, pink or purple flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its botanical features include opposite leaves and a compact growth habit, contributing to its ornamental value."
