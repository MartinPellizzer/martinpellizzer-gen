    "intro": "Trianthema turgidifolium, commonly known as the swollen-leaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Trianthema turgidifolium is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
