    "intro": "Tillandsia ventanaensis, commonly known as the Ventana air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with vibrant red and purple flowers. Tillandsia ventanaensis is relatively easy to care for, requiring minimal watering and indirect sunlight."
