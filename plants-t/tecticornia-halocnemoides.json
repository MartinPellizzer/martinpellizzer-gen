    "intro": "Tecticornia halocnemoides, commonly known as the coastal tussock grass, is a halophyte native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fibrous roots that help stabilize sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a waxy coating to reduce water loss in saline environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale blue. Tecticornia halocnemoides is well adapted to coastal and inland saltbush habitats, thriving in low-nutrient, saline soils."
