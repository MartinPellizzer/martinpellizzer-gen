    "intro": "Thymelaea passerina subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy thymelaea, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
