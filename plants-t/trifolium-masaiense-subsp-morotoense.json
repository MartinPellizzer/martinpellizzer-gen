    "intro": "Trifolium masaiense subsp. morotoense, commonly known as the Moroto clover, is a perennial herb native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential for forage, it is of interest in both horticultural and ecological studies."
