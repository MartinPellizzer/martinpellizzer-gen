    "intro": "Trichomanes clathratum, commonly known as the basket fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often used in ornamental horticulture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in small, cup-like formations called indusia. Trichomanes clathratum is also noted for its ability to form dense mats, which help in soil stabilization and moisture retention."
