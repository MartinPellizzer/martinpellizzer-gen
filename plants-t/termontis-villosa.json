    "intro": "Termontis villosa, commonly known as the hairy termontis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape, and often have a slightly rough texture. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that mature to a dark purple color. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks."
