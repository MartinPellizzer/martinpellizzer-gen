    "intro": "Thelypteris gymnocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-fruited shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its densely packed, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are covered in a smooth, non-glandular surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Thelypteris gymnocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, evergreen foliage."
