    "intro": "Thesium stirtonii, commonly known as the Cape York thesium, is a flowering plant native to the Cape York Peninsula in northern Queensland, Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has a fibrous root system and features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native region. Thesium stirtonii is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
