    "intro": "Taraxacum pruinatum, commonly known as the silvery dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces a single, hollow stem that terminates in a bright yellow flower head, which develops into a spherical seed ball covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowers are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological role in supporting biodiversity. Taraxacum pruinatum is adapted to harsh, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine meadows and dry slopes."
