    "intro": "Trisetum palustre, commonly known as bog hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Trisetum palustre thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and marshes. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
