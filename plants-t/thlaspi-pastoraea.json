    "intro": "Thlaspi pastoraea, commonly known as field pennycress, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are usually alternate and pinnately divided. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
