    "intro": "Triticum dasystachyum, commonly known as wild wheat, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its seeds are small and can be wind-dispersed, contributing to its widespread distribution. Triticum dasystachyum is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for use in breeding programs for improved wheat varieties."
