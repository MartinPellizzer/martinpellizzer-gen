    "intro": "Tectaria trifoliata var. minima, commonly known as the small-leaf tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and trifoliate (three-lobed) fronds, which are typically small in size. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spores are dispersed through the wind. The leaves are usually leathery and have a distinctive, intricate venation pattern."
