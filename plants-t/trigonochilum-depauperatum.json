    "intro": "Trigonochilum depauperatum, commonly known as the poor man's orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree branches or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. It is characterized by its simple structure and minimal foliage, which helps it conserve resources in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its rarity and specific environmental requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized greenhouses."
