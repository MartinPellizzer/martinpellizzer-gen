    "intro": "Trichipteris microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, round, floating leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are usually divided into four lobes, giving it a distinctive, clover-like appearance. Trichipteris microphylla plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
