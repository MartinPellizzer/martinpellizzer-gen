    "intro": "Taraxacum peninsulae, commonly known as the Peninsula dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant is perennial, typically growing in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its seed heads produce numerous lightweight seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a common adaptation in the Asteraceae family. The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological role."
