    "intro": "Trichocereus clavatus, commonly known as the \"Candelabra Cactus,\" is a species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that often branch into multiple stems, resembling a candlestick. The plant produces large, nocturnal blossoms that are typically white or pale pink, which open at night. It is adapted to high-altitude environments and requires well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Trichocereus clavatus is also known for its potential psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids like mescaline."
