    "intro": "Tibetia yadongensis, commonly known as the Yadong gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
