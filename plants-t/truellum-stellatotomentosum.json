    "intro": "Truellum stellatotomentosum, commonly known as the star-tomentose truellum, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped leaves covered in dense, woolly hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its growth habit is typically herbaceous, with a low, sprawling form. Truellum stellatotomentosum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks."
