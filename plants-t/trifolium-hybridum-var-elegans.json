    "intro": "Trifolium hybridum var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant white clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. This variety is often found in temperate regions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It has a creeping growth habit, forming dense mats that can suppress weeds. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
