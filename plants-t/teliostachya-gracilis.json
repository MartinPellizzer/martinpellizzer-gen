It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind. Teliostachya gracilis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
