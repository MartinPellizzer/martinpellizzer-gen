    "intro": "Tussilago pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean coltsfoot, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils at elevations above 1,000 meters. Its basal leaves are thick and covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs, which help to insulate the plant in cold environments. The showy yellow flowers appear in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
