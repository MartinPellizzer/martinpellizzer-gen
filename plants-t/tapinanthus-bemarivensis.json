    "intro": "Tapinanthus bemarivensis, commonly known as the Madagascar ghost flower, is a parasitic plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling ghostly shapes. It typically parasitizes trees and shrubs, attaching itself to the host with a specialized root system. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
