It is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Turbith thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
