    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum var. schimperi, commonly known as Ethiopian spelt, is a wild relative of modern wheat with ancient origins in the highlands of Ethiopia. It is a hexaploid species, meaning it has six sets of chromosomes, which contributes to its genetic diversity and adaptability. The plant produces small, tough grains that are encased in a tough hull, which must be removed before consumption. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and narrow leaves, typical of many wild grasses. This variety is valued for its nutritional content and is often used in traditional and heirloom baking practices."
