    "intro": "Telis maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in saline and well-drained soils. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy habitats, often along shorelines and cliffs. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing protection against salt spray and wind. Telis maritima is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to thrive in full sun."
