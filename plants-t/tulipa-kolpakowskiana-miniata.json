    "intro": "Tulipa kolpakowskiana miniata, commonly known as the Kolpakovsky tulip, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from deep red to orange and yellow, with a distinctive dark blotch on the outer petals. The plant produces strap-like leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy, adapting to its arid and high-altitude environment. It blooms in early spring and is prized for its ornamental value in gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
