It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. This plant is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. It has a deep root system that helps in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil fertility.
