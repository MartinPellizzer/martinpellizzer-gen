    "intro": "Torilis arvensis, commonly known as field panicgrass, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits known as achenes. Torilis arvensis is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas."
