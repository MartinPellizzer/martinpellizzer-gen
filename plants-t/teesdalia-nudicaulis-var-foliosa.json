    "intro": "Teesdalia nudicaulis var. foliosa, commonly known as the woolly false dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It features a basal rosette of soft, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that resemble dandelion fluff. Its leaves are characterized by their narrow, lance-shaped form and a distinctive, woolly texture. This variety is often found in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments."
