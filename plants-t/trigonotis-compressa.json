    "intro": "Trigonotis compressa, commonly known as the narrowleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually blue or violet in color. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the late afternoon, hence its common name. Trigonotis compressa is often found in moist, open habitats such as woodland edges and riverbanks."
