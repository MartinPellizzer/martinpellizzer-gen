    "intro": "Tectaria hekouensis, commonly known as the Hekou shield fern, is a species of polypod fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its intricate fronds with a distinctive shield-shaped appearance, which gives it its common name. Native to China, particularly in the Yunnan province, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are typically leathery and have a complex venation pattern, typical of many ferns in the Polypodiaceae family. Tectaria hekouensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
