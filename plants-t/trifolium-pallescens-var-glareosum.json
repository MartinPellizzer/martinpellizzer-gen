    "intro": "Trifolium pallescens var. glareosum, commonly known as the pale clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval or heart-shaped leaflets, often with a pale green or silvery underside. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, typical of the legume family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas or along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
