    "intro": "Trifolium andinum, commonly known as Andean clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. Trifolium andinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal practices in some regions."
