It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. The plants are characterized by their spiny stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. They are adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water and high sunlight exposure. Tricerastes species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and resilience."
