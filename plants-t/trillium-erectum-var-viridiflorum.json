    "intro": "Trillium erectum var. viridiflorum, commonly known as the green-flowered white trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features three broadly ovate leaves that are typically a deep green, and it produces a single, showy white flower with three petals and three sepals. The plant's flowers open in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and it blooms on a short, upright stem. It thrives in rich, moist woodland soils and is often found in shaded, undisturbed habitats. Trillium erectum var. viridiflorum is a member of the Melanthiaceae family and is known for its striking, ephemeral floral display."
