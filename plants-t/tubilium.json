It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs characterized by their compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves. The flowers are typically borne in clusters and are often pink or white, adding ornamental value to the plant. Tubilium species are adapted to grow in acidic, well-drained soils, often found in woodland or heathland environments. These plants are relatively hardy and can thrive in a variety of climates, making them popular choices for garden cultivation."
