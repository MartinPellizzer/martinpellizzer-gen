    "intro": "Tragia involucrata var. genuina, commonly known as the roughleaf tragia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its branched stems and small, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to thrive in dry conditions with minimal water requirements. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
