    "intro": "Taraxacum stepanovae, commonly known as the Stepnovsky's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a hairy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
