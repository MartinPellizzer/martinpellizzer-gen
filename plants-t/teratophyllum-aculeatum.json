    "intro": "Teratophyllum aculeatum, commonly known as the spiny teratophyllum, is a unique succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Teratophyllum aculeatum is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
