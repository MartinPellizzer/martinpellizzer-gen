    "intro": "Trichoscypha ledermannii, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable to extinction."
