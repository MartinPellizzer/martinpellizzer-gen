    "intro": "Trichomanes lucidum, commonly known as the shining maidenhair fern, is a delicate and ancient fern species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are often covered with a waxy cuticle, giving it a shiny appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the margins of the fronds. Trichomanes lucidum is known for its primitive features and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
