    "intro": "Tillandsia plicatifolia, commonly known as the pleated air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it collect and retain moisture. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, white powdery coating called trichomes, which aid in water absorption. Tillandsia plicatifolia is relatively low-maintenance and can thrive in a variety of indoor environments with proper light and humidity."
