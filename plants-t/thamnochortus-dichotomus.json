    "intro": "Thamnochortus dichotomus, commonly known as the forked broom, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are borne in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Thamnochortus dichotomus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
