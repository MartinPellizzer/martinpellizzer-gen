    "intro": "Trigonochilum ballii, commonly known as the Ball's trigonochilum, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and intricate, often fragrant flowers with three distinct lobes. The plant typically blooms during the wet season, producing showy, colorful petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Trigonochilum ballii thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing in the understorey of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
