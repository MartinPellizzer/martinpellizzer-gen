    "intro": "Torilis aglochis, commonly known as the common hedge parsley, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small white or greenish flowers that appear in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. Torilis aglochis is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
