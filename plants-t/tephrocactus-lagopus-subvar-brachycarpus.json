    "intro": "Tephrocactus lagopus subvar. brachycarpus, commonly known as the short-stemmed desert cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a compact, rounded shape and dense clusters of small, pale green to blue-gray pads. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. This subvariety is distinguished by its shorter stems and broader, more rounded pads compared to other members of the Tephrocactus genus."
