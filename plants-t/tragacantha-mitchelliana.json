    "intro": "Tragacantha mitchelliana, commonly known as Mitchell's tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that produces yellowish-green flowers and is characterized by its woody, branching structure. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with thick, leathery leaves that reduce water loss. Its fruit is a capsule that releases seeds when mature, contributing to its role in local ecosystems. Tragacantha mitchelliana is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of gum."
