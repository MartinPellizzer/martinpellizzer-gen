    "intro": "Thymus vandasii, commonly known as the Vanda thyme, is a rare and unique plant that combines characteristics of both thymes and orchids. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep violet, often resembling those of true thymes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly aromatic scent when crushed. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Thymus vandasii is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
