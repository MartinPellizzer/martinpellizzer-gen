It is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves. The plant features a short, stocky rhizome and produces striking, spatulate-shaped leaves with a waxy surface.

It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks."
