    "intro": "Tolpis concolor, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and striking blue flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its flowers bloom in early spring, producing a delicate blue hue that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Tolpis concolor is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
