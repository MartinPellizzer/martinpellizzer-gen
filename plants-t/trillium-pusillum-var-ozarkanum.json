    "intro": "Trillium pusillum var. ozarkanum, commonly known as the Ozark small white trillium, is a rare and delicate wildflower native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Trillium genus, characterized by its three-parted leaves and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale pink, bloom in early spring and are surrounded by three sepals that resemble petals. The species is noted for its slow growth and is often protected due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
