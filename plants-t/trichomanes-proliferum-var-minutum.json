    "intro": "Trichomanes proliferum var. minutum, commonly known as the small-leaf moonwort, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its finely divided, needle-like fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or woodland floors. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
