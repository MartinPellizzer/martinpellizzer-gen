    "intro": "Tetraith, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires a humid, shaded environment and is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, the Tetraith is considered a conservation concern."
