    "intro": "Turkia, commonly known as the Turk's cap, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the genus Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, cone-shaped flower clusters that resemble a Turkish cap, hence its common name. Turkia typically grows in rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy shrub in arid environments. Its showy blooms, which range in color from red to pink, attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
