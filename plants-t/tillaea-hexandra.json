    "intro": "Tillaea hexandra, commonly known as the mountain snowbell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, narrow leaves and is adapted to cold, arid environments with poor soil. Tillaea hexandra is often found in rocky habitats and is considered a species of conservation concern due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important subject in botanical studies of alpine flora."
