    "intro": "Tilia stellatopilosa, commonly known as the starry-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, star-like pubescence, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, fuzzy fruits. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Tilia stellatopilosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
