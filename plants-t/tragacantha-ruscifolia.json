    "intro": "Tragacantha ruscifolia, commonly known as the leafless tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stem and the absence of leaves, with its photosynthetic function carried out by its green, fleshy stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
