    "intro": "Triticum durum acutidenticulatum, commonly known as the acute-dentate durum wheat, is a wild relative of cultivated wheat species. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and spikelets that bear small, hard grains. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is adapted to a variety of soil conditions. Its genetic diversity makes it valuable for breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience. This species plays a role in understanding the evolution and domestication of wheat crops."
