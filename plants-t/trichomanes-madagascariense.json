    "intro": "Trichomanes madagascariense, commonly known as the Madagascar water fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid tropical climates. Its reproductive structures, including sori and indusia, are small and clustered, typical of the Hymenophyllaceae family. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
