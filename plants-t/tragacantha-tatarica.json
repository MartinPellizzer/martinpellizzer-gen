    "intro": "Tragacantha tatarica, commonly known as Tatarian tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the steppes of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It produces distinctive yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its fibrous, woody root system and its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs. The plant is notable for its latex-rich sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive."
