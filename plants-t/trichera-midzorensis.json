    "intro": "Trichera midzorensis, commonly known as the Zambian cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the tropical regions of Zambia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichera midzorensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
