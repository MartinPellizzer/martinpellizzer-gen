    "intro": "Tetraglochin flexuosa, commonly known as the waxy leaf heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and sandy environments. Tetraglochin flexuosa is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
