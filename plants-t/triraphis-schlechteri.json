It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its upright, herbaceous growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces distinctive, three-lobed bracts that surround the inflorescence.
