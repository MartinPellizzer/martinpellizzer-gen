    "intro": "Thelypteris archboldiae, commonly known as the Archbold's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Thelypteris archboldiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
