    "intro": "Teucrium fruticans subsp. prostratum, commonly known as prostrate germander, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically features prostrate or decumbent stems that spread along the ground, covered with small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers, which are arranged in dense spikes and bloom during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and ecological landscapes."
