    "intro": "Thalictrum nortonii, commonly known as Norton's meadow-rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are surrounded by showy, modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Thalictrum nortonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
