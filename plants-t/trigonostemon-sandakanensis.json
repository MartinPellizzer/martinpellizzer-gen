    "intro": "Trigonostemon sandakanensis, commonly known as the Borneo sandakan tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, spherical fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
