    "intro": "Thymocarpus cannoides, commonly known as the desert thyme or canyon thyme, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its aromatic, small, yellowish flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces small, dry, indehiscent fruits called legumes. It is adapted to harsh, dry environments and has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers. Thymocarpus cannoides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
