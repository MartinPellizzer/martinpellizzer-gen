    "intro": "Tephrocactus virgultus, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive long periods of drought. The flowers bloom in late spring, adding a striking visual contrast to the plant's rugged appearance."
