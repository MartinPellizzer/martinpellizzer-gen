    "intro": "Turpinia laurifolia, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. Turpinia laurifolia thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its dense growth habit also makes it useful for erosion control in coastal and wetland areas."
