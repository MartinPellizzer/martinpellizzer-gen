    "intro": "Teucrium lagunae, commonly known as the Laguna germander, is a flowering plant native to the island of La Gomera in the Canary Islands. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright blue or violet flowers, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid, subtropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Teucrium lagunae is considered a rare and endemic species."
