    "intro": "Tragosma foetidum, commonly known as the stink vine, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a climbing shrub that produces small, fragrant flowers, though the plant is noted for its strong, unpleasant odor. The leaves are opposite, simple, and often hairy, while the fruits are capsule-like and contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties, though its pungent scent makes it less desirable in cultivated settings."
