    "intro": "Tricyclandra, commonly known as the African daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa and consists of several species, most of which are herbaceous perennials. The plants typically have basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produce showy, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white or pale pink petals. Tricyclandra species are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their striking floral displays."
