    "intro": "Tephrosia contorta, commonly known as the curly-top tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds, and it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Tephrosia contorta is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in agroforestry systems. Its botanical features make it both ecologically valuable and potentially useful in sustainable land management practices."
