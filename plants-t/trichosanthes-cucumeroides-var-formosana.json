It produces large, elongated fruits with a thick, rough rind and a bitter interior. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruit, though it requires careful handling due to its bitterness.
