    "intro": "Triodon polymorphus var. macrophyllus, commonly known as the large-leaf triodon, is a species of flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique leaf morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
