    "intro": "Tiarella bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate foamflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features delicate, nodding white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are typically covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. It thrives in shady, moist woodland habitats and is well-suited for garden use in shaded areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
