    "intro": "Trisetum spicatum subsp. montanum, commonly known as mountain false brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in high-altitude environments."
