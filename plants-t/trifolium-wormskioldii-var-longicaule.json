    "intro": "Trifolium wormskioldii var. longicaule, commonly known as the long-stemmed hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and have a distinctive dark green color. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, and it is known for its robust growth habit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration and as a forage crop."
