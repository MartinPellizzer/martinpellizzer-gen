    "intro": "Taeniophyllum subtrilobum, commonly known as the three-lobed moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, cryptogamic plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocky substrates or in forest floors. The plant exhibits a thalloid structure with a flat, ribbon-like body that is often divided into three lobes, giving it its common name. It lacks true leaves and roots, relying instead on rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient absorption. Taeniophyllum subtrilobum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
