    "intro": "Tricalysia trilocularis, commonly known as the three-chambered balsa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its soft, lightweight wood, which is similar to that of the balsa tree. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a hairy texture. Tricalysia trilocularis is valued for its unique wood properties and is sometimes used in lightweight construction applications."
