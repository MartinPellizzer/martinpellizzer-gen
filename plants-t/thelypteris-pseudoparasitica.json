    "intro": "Thelypteris pseudoparasitica, commonly known as the false parasitic fern, is a rare and unusual species belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are often clustered in dense, compact growths. The plant exhibits a unique morphology, with sporangia often found on the underside of the fronds rather than on specialized structures. It is typically found in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive in low light conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
