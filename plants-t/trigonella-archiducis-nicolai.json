    "intro": "Trigonella archiducis-nicolai, commonly known as the Archduke Nicolas trigonella, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant is native to specific regions in the Mediterranean and is often found in rocky or arid habitats. It produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
