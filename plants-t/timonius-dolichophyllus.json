    "intro": "Timonius dolichophyllus, commonly known as the long-leaf timonius, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves. It is native to specific regions with particular soil and climate conditions, making it a specialist in ecological niches. The plant exhibits a distinct growth habit, often growing close to the ground with a low, sprawling form. Its botanical features include small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Timonius dolichophyllus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
