It is a perennial legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a robust root system that helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in landscaping and ecological restoration. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in coastal areas and open woodlands. Trigonotis coronata is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
