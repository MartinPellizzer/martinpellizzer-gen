    "intro": "Tragacantha obcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gum plant, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, obcordate (heart-shaped) leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the formation of distinctive, globular seed pods. It is valued for its gum resin, which has been used historically in various medicinal and industrial applications. Tragacantha obcordata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments."
