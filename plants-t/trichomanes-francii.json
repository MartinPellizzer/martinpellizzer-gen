    "intro": "Trichomanes francii, commonly known as the French water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, delicate plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The fronds of Trichomanes francii are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid conditions. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the undersides of its leaves. This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade."
