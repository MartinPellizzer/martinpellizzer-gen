    "intro": "Trifolium campestre var. thionanthum, commonly known as the sweet clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a distinctive white or pale green coloration. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and historical use in agriculture and traditional medicine."
