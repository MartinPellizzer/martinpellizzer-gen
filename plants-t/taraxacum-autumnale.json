    "intro": "Taraxacum autumnale, commonly known as the autumn dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed with a white, puffy pappus. It typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, adapting to cooler temperatures. Botanically, it belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads."
