    "intro": "Trianea bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that grow in a compact, rosette-like formation. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests and high-altitude grasslands. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cool, humid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trianea bogotensis is considered a vulnerable species."
