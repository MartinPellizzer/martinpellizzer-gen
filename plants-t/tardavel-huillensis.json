    "intro": "Tardavel huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue floral coloration and compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, intricate flowers with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in cool, humid microclimates with well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tardavel huillensis is considered a vulnerable species."
