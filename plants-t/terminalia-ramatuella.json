It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, palmate leaves that turn a striking red or orange during the dry season. The tree produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in dense, spherical clusters, giving it its common name. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Terminalia ramatuella is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
