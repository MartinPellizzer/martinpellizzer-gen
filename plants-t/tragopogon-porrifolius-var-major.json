    "intro": "Tragopogon porrifolius var. major, commonly known as the giant thimbleweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 2 meters tall, topped with a cluster of showy, yellow-rayed flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The species is notable for its ability to hybridize with other Tragopogon species, leading to the famous \"flowering plants\" phenomenon in the Pacific Northwest."
