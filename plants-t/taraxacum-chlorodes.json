    "intro": "Taraxacum chlorodes, commonly known as the green-rayed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and is characterized by its bright green, velvety leaves and yellow flower heads. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem that supports the flower and is often used as a natural marker for locating the plant. Its flowers develop into fluffy white seed heads, which are dispersed by the wind. Taraxacum chlorodes is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
