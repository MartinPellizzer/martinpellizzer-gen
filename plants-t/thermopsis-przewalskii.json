    "intro": "Thermopsis przewalskii, commonly known as the Przewalski's yellow gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes with poor soil conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stem is erect and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
