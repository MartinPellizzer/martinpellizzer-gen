    "intro": "Taraxacum lonchophyllum, commonly known as the long-leaf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is native to the western United States, particularly in California, where it grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its long, slender leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. It produces a distinctive seed head with pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Taraxacum lonchophyllum is often found in sunny, well-drained environments and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions."
