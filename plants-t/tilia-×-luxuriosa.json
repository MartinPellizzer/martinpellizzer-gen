    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 luxuriosa, commonly known as the giant lime tree, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Tilia cordata and Tilia europaea. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed and have a distinctive waxy texture. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and light grey, becoming fissured with age, and it can grow to impressive heights, sometimes exceeding 30 meters. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in parks and gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
