It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical form of Thesium divaricatum."
