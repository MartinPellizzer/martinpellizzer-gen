    "intro": "Taraxacum maricum, commonly known as the sea dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The plant produces bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates. Taraxacum maricum is adapted to coastal conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species."
