    "intro": "Thouinia villosa, commonly known as the hairy thouinia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It features slender, erect stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and also bear a fuzzy texture, contributing to its overall hairy appearance. Thouinia villosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
