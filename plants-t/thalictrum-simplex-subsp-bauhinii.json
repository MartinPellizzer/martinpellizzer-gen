    "intro": "Thalictrum simplex subsp. bauhinii, commonly known as the white meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, white, fluffy flowers resembling a cloud, which bloom in early summer. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are soft to the touch, contributing to its delicate appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or meadows. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
