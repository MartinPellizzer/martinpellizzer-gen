    "intro": "Trichomanes lucens, commonly known as the shining maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and covered with fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes lucens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
