    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 gaaliana, commonly known as the hybrid linden, is a deciduous tree that belongs to the Tiliaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Tilia cordata (small-leaf linden) and Tilia europaea (large-leaf linden), resulting in a plant with characteristics of both parent species. The tree is noted for its heart-shaped leaves that are typically larger than those of Tilia cordata but smaller than Tilia europaea. It produces fragrant, pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often found in temperate regions across Europe."
