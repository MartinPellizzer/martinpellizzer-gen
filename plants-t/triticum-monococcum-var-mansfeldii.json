    "intro": "Triticum monococcum var. mansfeldii, commonly known as the wild emmer wheat, is a wild relative of modern wheat species. It is native to the Fertile Crescent and exhibits a range of morphological and genetic traits that make it valuable for genetic research. This plant typically grows as an annual grass with slender stems and spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, hard grains that are adapted to arid environments. The species is of interest for its potential contributions to improving drought resistance and yield in cultivated wheat varieties."
