    "intro": "Toxanthes perpusillus, commonly known as the dwarf sea anemone, is a marine plant belonging to the order Anthozoa. It is characterized by its small, delicate polyps that typically measure less than 1 centimeter in length. This species thrives in shallow coastal waters, often found in tidal zones where it attaches itself to substrates like rocks or coral. Its botanical structure consists of a central gastrovascular cavity surrounded by a ring of tentacles used for capturing prey. Toxanthes perpusillus plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various small aquatic organisms."
