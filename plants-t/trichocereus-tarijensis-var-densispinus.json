It is characterized by its dense, spiny areoles and a generally compact growth habit. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its stems are typically ribbed and can store significant amounts of water, adapting it to arid environments. This variety is highly sought after by cactus enthusiasts for its unique appearance and ease of cultivation."
