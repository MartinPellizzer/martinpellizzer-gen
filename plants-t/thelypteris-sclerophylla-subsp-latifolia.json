    "intro": "Thelypteris sclerophylla subsp. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its stout, upright rhizomes and leathery, dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The fronds are typically divided into pairs of lobes, with the terminal pinnae often being broader than the others. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. The plant's dense, compact growth habit makes it a desirable ground cover in shaded garden settings."
