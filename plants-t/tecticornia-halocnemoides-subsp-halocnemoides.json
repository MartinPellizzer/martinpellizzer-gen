    "intro": "Tecticornia halocnemoides subsp. halocnemoides, commonly known as the sandplain spinifex, is a halophytic grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes. Its ability to tolerate salt and drought makes it an important component of stabilizing sandy landscapes."
