    "intro": "Thelypteris jujuyensis, commonly known as the Jujuy holly fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds. Thelypteris jujuyensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
