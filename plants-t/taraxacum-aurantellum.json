    "intro": "Taraxacum aurantellum, commonly known as the orange hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the dandelion family (Compositae) and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a large number of seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a common trait among members of its family. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
