    "intro": "Thalictrum ingratum, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable environments. Thalictrum ingratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
