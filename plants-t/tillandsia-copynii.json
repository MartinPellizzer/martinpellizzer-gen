    "intro": "Tillandsia copynii, commonly known as the Guatemalan air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, delicate flowers that are usually white or pale pink, adding a subtle ornamental value. Due to its air-purifying qualities and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
