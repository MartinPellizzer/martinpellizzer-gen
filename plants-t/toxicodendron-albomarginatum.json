    "intro": "Toxicodendron albomarginatum, commonly known as the white-margin poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, with the central leaflet often having a distinctive white or pale margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries containing toxic seeds. It is known for its ability to cause skin irritation due to the presence of urushiol, a potent allergen. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
