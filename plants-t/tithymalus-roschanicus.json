    "intro": "Tithymalus roschanicus, commonly known as the rock thyme, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and aromatic, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, sunny environments. Tithymalus roschanicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
