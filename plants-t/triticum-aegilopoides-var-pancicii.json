    "intro": "Triticum aegilopoides var. pancicii, commonly known as Pancici's wild wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and has narrow, linear leaves with a rough texture. It is closely related to cultivated wheat species and has been studied for its potential in genetic research and crop improvement. Its seeds are small and can be dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution."
