    "intro": "Thelypteris interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into segments with a distinctive interrupted pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense mat of foliage. Thelypteris interrupta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its fine, fern-like appearance."
