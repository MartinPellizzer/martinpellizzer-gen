    "intro": "Taraxacum pleniflorum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a bright yellow flower head. The flower head consists of numerous small, petal-less florets that mature into fluffy white seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. This species is widespread across temperate regions and is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and adaptability. It has a long flowering period, typically from spring to early autumn, and is known for its medicinal and nutritional properties."
