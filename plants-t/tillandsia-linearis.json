    "intro": "Tillandsia linearis, commonly known as the linear air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in length. The plant does not require soil for growth, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity. Tillandsia linearis is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to various environments."
