    "intro": "Trapa acornis, commonly known as the spiny water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its floating leaves and spiny, nut-like fruits that develop underwater. The plant has a short, stout stem that supports its broad, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish in color. Trapa acornis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and stabilizing water bodies."
