    "intro": "Thesium nautimontanum, commonly known as the sea thesium, is a flowering plant species native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in dune environments. The plant features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. Thesium nautimontanum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
