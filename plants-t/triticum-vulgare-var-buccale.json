    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. buccale, commonly known as the \"mouth wheat,\" is a lesser-known variant of common wheat. It is characterized by its unique seed structure, which features a prominent, fleshy appendage resembling a mouth, hence its common name. This botanical feature is believed to aid in seed dispersal by attracting animals. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in various soil types. While not widely cultivated for grain production, it is of interest in botanical studies due to its distinctive morphology and evolutionary adaptations."
