It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean and arid climates."
