    "intro": "Tapinanthus sessilifolius, commonly known as the parasitic dodder, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the stems of other plants to derive nutrients. It lacks true leaves and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for sustenance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a fibrous, root-like structure called a haustorium that penetrates the host's vascular system. It is native to Africa and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken or even kill its host plants."
