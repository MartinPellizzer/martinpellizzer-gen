    "intro": "Telitoxicum minutiflorum, commonly known as the tiny flower poisonplant, is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, miniature flowers. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant's leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly serrated edge. Its flowers are clustered in small inflorescences, producing a subtle, almost imperceptible fragrance. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by herbivores and requires caution when handling."
