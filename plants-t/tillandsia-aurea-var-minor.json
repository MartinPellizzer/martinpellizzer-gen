    "intro": "Tillandsia aurea var. minor, commonly known as the miniature yellow tillandsia, is a bromeliad species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water absorption. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in shaded, humid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
