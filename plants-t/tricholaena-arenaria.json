It is a small, shrub-like plant that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features a short trunk with a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into edible, round fruits. Tricholaena arenaria plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
