    "intro": "Trochocephalus isetensis, commonly known as the Isetinskaya orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Russia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers with a distinctive coloration pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forested areas with rich, humus-filled soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers bloom in late summer, adding a touch of elegance to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
