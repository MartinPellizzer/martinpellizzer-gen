It is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters of three, hence its scientific name. The plant has fleshy, strap-like leaves that store water, adapting it to its humid, shaded habitats. It thrives in warm, moist environments with good air circulation. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
