It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Tetreilema boliviense is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
