    "intro": "Tachigali poeppigiana, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
