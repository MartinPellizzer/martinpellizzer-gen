    "intro": "Tetraria xyridioides, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its compact growth habit and ability to store water in its leaves make it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Tetraria xyridioides plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
