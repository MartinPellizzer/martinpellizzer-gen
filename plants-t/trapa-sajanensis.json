    "intro": "Trapa sajanensis, commonly known as the Sajan water chestnut, is a species of water plant native to the freshwater habitats of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves and distinctive, spiny fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant typically grows in shallow waters and is adapted to seasonal flooding. Its leaves are broad and round, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Trapa sajanensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling."
