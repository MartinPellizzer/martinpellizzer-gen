    "intro": "Trisetum trinii var. litorale, commonly known as the coastal trisetum, is a grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. This variety thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its flowering spikes are usually pale green to brown, and the plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Trisetum trinii var. litorale plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in coastal areas."
