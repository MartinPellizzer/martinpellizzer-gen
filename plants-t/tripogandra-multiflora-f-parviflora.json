    "intro": "Tripogandra multiflora f. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered tripogandra, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial characterized by its slender stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
