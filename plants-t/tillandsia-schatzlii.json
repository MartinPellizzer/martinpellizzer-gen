    "intro": "Tillandsia schatzlii, commonly known as the Schatzlii air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped foliage that traps moisture from the air, allowing it to thrive in humid, high-altitude environments. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, with a waxy coating that aids in water retention. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom briefly before the plant goes dormant. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
