    "intro": "Thuja freneloides, commonly known as the Mediterranean thuja, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, compact foliage that is dark green and aromatic. The plant has scale-like leaves that are tightly packed on short shoots, giving it a dense, bushy appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Thuja freneloides is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
