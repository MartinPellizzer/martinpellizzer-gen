    "intro": "Trifolium macraei f. catalinae, commonly known as Catalina clover, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Channel Islands. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, typically with three leaflets arranged in a heart-shaped pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring season. It thrives in coastal habitats, often found on sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species requiring conservation efforts."
