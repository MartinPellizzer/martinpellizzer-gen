    "intro": "Tristerix viridiflorus, commonly known as the green-flowered tristerix, is a member of the Restionaceae family, native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, clustered greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal or sandy habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, and it is often found in coastal fynbos vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
