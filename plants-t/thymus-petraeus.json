    "intro": "Thymus petraeus, commonly known as rock thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and aromatic, small, gray-green leaves. The plant produces tiny, pink or lavender flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Thymus petraeus is also valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
