It is characterized by its distinctive three-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink or red, depending on the variety. The plant typically grows in rich, moist woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are rhomboid-shaped, giving it the common name, and it produces a single, erect stem with a single flower. Trillium \u00d7 rhombifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty."
