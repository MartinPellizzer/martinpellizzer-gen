    "intro": "Thalictrum minus subsp. calcareum, commonly known as the limestone meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to calcareous habitats in Europe. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
