    "intro": "Tragacantha vaccarum, commonly known as the thornless tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It is valued for its mucilage-rich resin, which has been used historically in medicine and as a binding agent. Tragacantha vaccarum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
