    "intro": "Trichomanes radicans var. anceps, commonly known as the creeping maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family (Pteridaceae). It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that often grow in dense, mat-like formations. The leaves are typically finely divided, with a distinctive rachis that is covered in small, hair-like structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant, feathery appearance."
