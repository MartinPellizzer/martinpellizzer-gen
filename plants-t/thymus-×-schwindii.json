    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 schwindii, commonly known as Schwind's thyme, is a hybrid shrub belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and small, aromatic leaves that emit a strong thyme scent. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in herbal teas."
