    "intro": "Thrincia saxatilis, commonly known as the rock thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-yellow, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. Thrincia saxatilis is adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
