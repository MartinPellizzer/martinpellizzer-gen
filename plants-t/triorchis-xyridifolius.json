    "intro": "Triorchis xyridifolius, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a slender, leafless stem that supports a cluster of narrow, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing showy, lip-shaped flowers that are often pink or purple in color. Its roots are adapted to thrive in moist, acidic soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
