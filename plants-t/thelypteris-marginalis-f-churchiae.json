It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or ascending. The plant produces spores on the underside of its leaves, which are released during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its foliage is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
