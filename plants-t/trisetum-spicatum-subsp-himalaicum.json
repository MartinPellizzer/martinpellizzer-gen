It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted inflorescences that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its foliage is often silver-gray, reflecting its adaptation to high-altitude conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rugged terrain."
