    "intro": "Tricalysia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved flame tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy green leaves that are small and elliptical in shape. The plant produces striking clusters of bright orange-red flowers during the dry season, which are followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant in warm climates."
