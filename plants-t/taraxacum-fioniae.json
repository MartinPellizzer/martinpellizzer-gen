    "intro": "Taraxacum fioniae, commonly known as the Fionia dandelion, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Italian Alps. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its yellow flower heads consist of numerous small florets, which eventually transform into the familiar white, fluffy seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Taraxacum fioniae is considered a vulnerable species."
