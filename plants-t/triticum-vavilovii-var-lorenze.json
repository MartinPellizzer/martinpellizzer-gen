    "intro": "Triticum vavilovii var. lorenze, commonly known as wild wheat, is a wild relative of cultivated wheat species. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its robust, grass-like appearance with long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, which are typically hard and inedible. It is valued in botanical studies for its genetic diversity and potential contributions to wheat improvement programs. This species plays a crucial role in understanding the evolution and domestication of wheat."
