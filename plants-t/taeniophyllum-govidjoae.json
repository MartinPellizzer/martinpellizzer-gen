It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the rainy season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
