    "intro": "Tithymalus literatus, commonly known as the white tithymalus, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in Mediterranean climates. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypsela. Tithymalus literatus is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
