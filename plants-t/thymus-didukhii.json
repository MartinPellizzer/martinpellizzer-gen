    "intro": "Thymus didukhii, commonly known as the Didukhii thyme, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lamiaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, particularly in Georgia and parts of Turkey. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with compact foliage and small, aromatic flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Thymus didukhii is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, similar to other thyme species."
