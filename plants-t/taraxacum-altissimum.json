    "intro": "Taraxacum altissimum, commonly known as the giant dandelion, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its robust, upright stem and large, deeply lobed leaves that can grow up to 20 cm in length. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem topped with a spherical cluster of yellow flowers, which later develops into a fluffy seed head. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sunny locations. The species is known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically in traditional herbal remedies."
