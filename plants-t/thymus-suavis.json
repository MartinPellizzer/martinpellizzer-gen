    "intro": "Thymus suavis, commonly known as sweet thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features aromatic, narrow leaves covered in fine hairs, which contribute to its distinctive fragrance. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and other compounds, are widely used in aromatherapy and traditional medicine."
