    "intro": "Turritis brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited turritis, is a flowering plant native to parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
