It features a basal rosette of narrow, elongated leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a spherical seed head with bristly pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive member of the Asteraceae family."
