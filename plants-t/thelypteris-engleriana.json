    "intro": "Thelypteris engleriana, commonly known as the Engler's water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate. Thelypteris engleriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, green foliage."
