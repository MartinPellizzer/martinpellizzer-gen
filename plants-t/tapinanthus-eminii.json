    "intro": "Tapinanthus eminii, commonly known as the Ethiopian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Ethiopia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, attaching itself via specialized roots. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, vine-like structure. It is often found growing on the stems of other plants, particularly in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host, sometimes leading to its death."
