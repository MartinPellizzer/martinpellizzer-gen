    "intro": "Triticum durum var. ramosohordeiforme, commonly known as durum wheat with ramosohordeiforme variation, is a botanical variant of durum wheat characterized by its unique floral morphology. It exhibits a distinctive branching pattern in its inflorescence, which sets it apart from standard durum wheat varieties. This variation is primarily observed in the structure of the rachis and the arrangement of the spikelets. The plant belongs to the Poaceae family and is cultivated for its high gluten content, suitable for pasta and semolina production. Its botanical traits make it a subject of interest in agricultural research for potential improvements in yield and adaptability."
