    "intro": "Taraxacum subpenicilliforme, commonly known as the slender dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, yellow flower head that develops into a pappus-equipped seed sphere. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The species is notable for its small stature and subtle floral structure compared to other dandelion species. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is often found in meadows and along roadsides."
