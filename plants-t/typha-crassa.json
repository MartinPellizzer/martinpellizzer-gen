    "intro": "Typha crassa, commonly known as the broadleaf cattail, is a wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spike that is typically brown or reddish in color. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous stem, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Typha crassa thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of lakes and ponds. Its structure provides habitat for various aquatic organisms and plays a role in water filtration and erosion control."
