    "intro": "Tapeinosperma whitei, commonly known as the White's sandstone pear, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, pear-shaped fruits. These fruits contain a single seed enclosed in a hard, woody capsule. Tapeinosperma whitei is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
