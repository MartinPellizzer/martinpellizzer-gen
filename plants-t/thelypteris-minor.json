    "intro": "Thelypteris minor, commonly known as the lesser shield fern, is a small to medium-sized fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a slender, upright rhizome with a dense cluster of lance-shaped fronds. Its fronds are usually 15\u201330 cm long, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. Thelypteris minor produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
