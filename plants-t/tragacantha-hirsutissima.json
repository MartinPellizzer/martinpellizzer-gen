    "intro": "Tragacantha hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces a distinctive gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a food additive. Its leaves are hairy and lobed, contributing to its rugged appearance. Tragacantha hirsutissima is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand arid conditions."
