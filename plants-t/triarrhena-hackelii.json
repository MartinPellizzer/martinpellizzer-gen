    "intro": "Triarrhena hackelii, commonly known as the Hackel's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its foliage is typically gray-green, and it is often found in rocky soils or on slopes. Triarrhena hackelii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
