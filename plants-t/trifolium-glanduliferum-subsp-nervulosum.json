    "intro": "Trifolium glanduliferum subsp. nervulosum, commonly known as the hairy clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and have a distinctive veining pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This subspecies is noted for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
