It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it survive in waterlogged soils. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments and supporting aquatic biodiversity."
