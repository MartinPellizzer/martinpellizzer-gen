    "intro": "Thymus glandulosus var. maroccanus, commonly known as Moroccan thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the arid regions of North Africa. It features aromatic, narrow leaves with a distinctive grayish-green color and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its glandular hairs, which contribute to its aromatic properties and help reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its essential oils are valued in both culinary and medicinal applications."
