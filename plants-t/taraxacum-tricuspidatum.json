    "intro": "Taraxacum tricuspidatum, commonly known as the three-lobed dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of alternate, spoon-shaped leaves with three distinct lobes. The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head composed of numerous tiny florets. After flowering, it develops a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism with a parachute-like structure called a pappus. It is commonly found in temperate regions, thriving in disturbed soils and sunny habitats."
