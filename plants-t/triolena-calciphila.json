    "intro": "Triolena calciphila, commonly known as the limestone violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to calcareous grasslands and rocky soils in Europe. It produces small, violet-blue flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to nutrient-poor, alkaline conditions. It is often found in open habitats where it thrives in full sun. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
