    "intro": "Tillandsia rubroviolacea, commonly known as the red-violet tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically violet or red, adding to its ornamental appeal. Tillandsia rubroviolacea is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
