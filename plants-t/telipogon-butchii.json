    "intro": "Telipogon butchii, commonly known as the Butch's orchid, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers with a distinctive coloration. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine rocklands and hardwood hammocks. It has a short rhizome and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
