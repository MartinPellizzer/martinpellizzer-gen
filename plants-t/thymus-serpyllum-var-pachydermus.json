    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. pachydermus, commonly known as broad-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, creeping stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically broader than those of the standard thymus serpyllum. The plant produces tiny, pink or white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, making it a popular choice for culinary and medicinal uses. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
