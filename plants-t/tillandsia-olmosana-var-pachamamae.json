    "intro": "Tillandsia olmosana var. pachamamae, commonly known as the Andean air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage forms a rosette that collects water and nutrients from the environment. The plant is characterized by its striking blue-green leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and purple. It is adapted to cool, humid climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
