It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and delicate, spiral-shaped fronds. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, curling appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light. This rare and unique fern is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests."
