    "intro": "Thelypteris hattorii, commonly known as the Hattori's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, serrated fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds. Thelypteris hattorii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
