    "intro": "Trisetum pumilum, commonly known as dwarf hairgrass, is a small perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Trisetum pumilum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
