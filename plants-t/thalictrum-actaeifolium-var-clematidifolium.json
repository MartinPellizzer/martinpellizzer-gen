It features delicate, fern-like leaves with a bipinnate structure, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in compound umbels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shady garden settings."
