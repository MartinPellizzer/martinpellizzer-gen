    "intro": "Tristachya hubbardiana, commonly known as the Hubbard's panic grass, is a perennial grass native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces inflorescences composed of dense clusters of small, spike-like structures, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a landscape plant."
