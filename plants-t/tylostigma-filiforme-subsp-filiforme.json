    "intro": "Tylostigma filiforme subsp. filiforme, commonly known as the slender-stemmed tylostigma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This subspecies is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
