    "intro": "Taxus baccata var. stricta, commonly known as the European yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer with a distinctive, narrow, columnar shape. It features dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged spirally along the branches. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It is native to Europe and western Asia, often found in woodlands and along riverbanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in both horticulture and traditional medicine."
