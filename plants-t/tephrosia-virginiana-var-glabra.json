    "intro": "Tephrosia virginiana var. glabra, commonly known as smooth tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in open woodlands. The plant features slender, erect stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a velvety texture. Its flowers are usually pale blue to white, arranged in clusters, and bloom in the summer months. Smooth tephrosia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
