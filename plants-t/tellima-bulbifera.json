    "intro": "Tellima bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbous tellima, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant produces bulb-like structures called bulbils, which serve as vegetative propagules and are used for reproduction. These bulbils are often found at the base of the plant or along the stems. Tellima bulbifera thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
