    "intro": "Tordylium pestalozzae, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Tordylium pestalozzae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
