It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are compound, with multiple leaflets that are usually deeply lobed and arranged alternately along the stem. Thalictrum tortuosum prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or meadows."
