    "intro": "Tectaria pluriseriata, commonly known as the many-ranked shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are pinnately compound with multiple rows of pinnae, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, which help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces. The leaves are usually leathery and have a rough texture, which aids in water retention in its natural habitat."
