It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup to collect water, a common adaptation in its native habitat. Its flowers are typically small and clustered in a thyrsus, which is a dense, branched inflorescence. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and flowering structure."
