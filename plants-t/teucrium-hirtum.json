    "intro": "Teucrium hirtum, commonly known as woolly germander, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features upright, branched stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from purple to pink, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and also covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged, drought-tolerant nature. Teucrium hirtum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties."
