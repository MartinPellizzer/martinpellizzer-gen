    "intro": "Trisetum congdonii, commonly known as the Congdon's wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky slopes. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Trisetum congdonii is often found in high-altitude habitats and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in fragile ecosystems."
