    "intro": "Taraxacum ceratophorum subsp. hjeltii, commonly known as the Hjelt's dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves. The plant produces a yellow flowering head that develops into a white, fluffy pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
