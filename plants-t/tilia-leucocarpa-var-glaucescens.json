    "intro": "Tilia leucocarpa var. glaucescens, commonly known as the white-barked linden, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that becomes fissured with age, and its heart-shaped leaves that are typically pale green and covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable ornamental tree in temperate climates. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ecological and horticultural purposes."
