    "intro": "Thelypteris coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Thelypteris coarctata plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms."
