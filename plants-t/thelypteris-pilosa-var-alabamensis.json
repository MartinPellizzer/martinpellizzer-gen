    "intro": "Thelypteris pilosa var. alabamensis, commonly known as the Alabama holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its leathery, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered with a fine, silky texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
