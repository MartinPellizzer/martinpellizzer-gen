It is characterized by its tall, leafy stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly hairy leaves and a more compact inflorescence compared to other Tragopogon species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. The plant is also noted for its edible leaves, which have a mild, slightly sweet flavor."
