    "intro": "Themistoclesia pariensis, commonly known as the Par\u00e1 orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and grows in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas."
