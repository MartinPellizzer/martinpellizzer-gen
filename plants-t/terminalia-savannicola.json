    "intro": "Terminalia savannicola, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, elliptical seeds. It thrives in savanna and woodland habitats, often growing in well-drained soils. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for timber and traditional uses."
