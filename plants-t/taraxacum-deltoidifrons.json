    "intro": "Taraxacum deltoidifrons, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. Its yellow composite flowers bloom in early summer, followed by the characteristic seed dispersal via wind-borne parachute structures. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
