    "intro": "Trillium tschonoskii f. violaceum, commonly known as the violet-flowered white trillium, is a rare and striking perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features a single, showy violet or purple flower that emerges from a whorl of three broadly elliptic leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, and the plant produces red or orange berries that are dispersed by birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
