    "intro": "Tillandsia rutschmannii, commonly known as the Rutschmann's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia rutschmannii is well adapted to low-light conditions and requires minimal care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
