    "intro": "Tilia laciniata, commonly known as the notched linden, is a deciduous tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are deeply notched and have a serrated edge. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The wood is light, soft, and easy to work with, making it valuable for carving and furniture making."
