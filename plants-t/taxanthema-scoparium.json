    "intro": "Taxanthema scoparium, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, perennial shrub characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers, which range in color from yellow to orange, bloom in late spring to early summer. Taxanthema scoparium is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
