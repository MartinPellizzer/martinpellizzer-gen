    "intro": "Triumfetta coronata, commonly known as the crown vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a woody vine characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. Triumfetta coronata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along riverbanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
