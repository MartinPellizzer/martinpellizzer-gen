It features compact, mat-forming foliage with small, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale pink to white flowers in early spring, which are highly aromatic and attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and ecological landscapes."
