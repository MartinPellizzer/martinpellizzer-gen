    "intro": "Tapinanthus sankuruensis, commonly known as the Sankuru dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a twining habit, often growing around the stems of other plants. It is typically found in moist, forested areas and is an example of hemiparasitism. Its unique ecological role makes it an interesting subject for botanical study."
