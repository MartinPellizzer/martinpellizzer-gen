    "intro": "Tephrosia linearis subsp. discolor, commonly known as the variable linear tephrosia, is a flowering plant species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in open woodland and grassland habitats, often along roadsides or in disturbed soils. Its seeds are encased in a hard, dry pod, and the plant is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies. The subspecies is distinguished by its variable leaf coloration and subtle differences in flower morphology compared to other Tephrosia species."
