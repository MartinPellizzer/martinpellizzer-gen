    "intro": "Tectaria incisa, commonly known as the slit-veined shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds with deep, narrow slits along the midrib, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes are short and thick, and it produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of its leaves. Tectaria incisa is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
