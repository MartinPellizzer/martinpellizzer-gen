    "intro": "Tectaria sodiroi, commonly known as the saddle fern, is a tropical fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense mats, contributing to its ability to colonize various substrates. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
