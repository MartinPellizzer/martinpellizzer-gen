It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and disturbed soils. Trachynia contains various bioactive compounds, including thujone, which has been historically used in herbal medicine. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals if ingested in large quantities."
