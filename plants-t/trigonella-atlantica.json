    "intro": "Trigonella atlantica, commonly known as Atlantic fenugreek, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. Its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers are typical of the genus Trigonella. The seeds of Trigonella atlantica are used in traditional medicine and are similar in use to those of other fenugreek species."
