    "intro": "Tetrapterys humilis, commonly known as the Mexican dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Santalales order. It typically grows on the branches of various host trees, such as oaks and hawthorns, in the Americas. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures that aid in photosynthesis. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and often clustered in dense inflorescences. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by birds and other animals."
