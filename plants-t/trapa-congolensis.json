    "intro": "Trapa congolensis, commonly known as the Congo water chestnut, is a species of aquatic plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its floating leaves and distinctive spiny fruits that resemble small nuts. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes and slow-moving rivers. Its leaves are typically rounded with a waxy surface, and the plant produces small white flowers that bloom above the water. Trapa congolensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
