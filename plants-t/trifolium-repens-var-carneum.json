    "intro": "Trifolium repens var. carneum, commonly known as the pink clover, is a variant of the white clover species characterized by its distinctive pink or reddish flower heads. This perennial herb is native to Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. The varietal form carneum is notable for its unique floral coloration, which sets it apart from the typical white clover."
