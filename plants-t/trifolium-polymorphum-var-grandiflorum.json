    "intro": "Trifolium polymorphum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
