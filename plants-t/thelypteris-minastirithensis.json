    "intro": "Thelypteris minastirithensis, commonly known as the Minastirithen rock fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and leathery, dark green fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Thelypteris minastirithensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
