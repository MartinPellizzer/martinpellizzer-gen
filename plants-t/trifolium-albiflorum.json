    "intro": "Trifolium albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. This makes it an important plant for soil enrichment and ecological balance."
