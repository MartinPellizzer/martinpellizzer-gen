    "intro": "Typha zerovii, commonly known as the narrowleaf cattail, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that produce fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant has long, strap-like leaves that form dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and contribute to wetland ecosystem health. Typha zerovii plays an important role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
