    "intro": "Thelypteris halconensis, commonly known as the Halconensis shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has feather-like fronds that are divided into numerous pinnae, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its rhizomes are short and often covered in a layer of brown, hairy tissue. Thelypteris halconensis plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
