    "intro": "Theodorea runcinata, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, vibrant red petals and a unique, elongated shape that distinguishes it from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its flowers bloom in clusters, adding a dramatic visual impact to its natural habitat. Theodorea runcinata is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
