    "intro": "Thelypteris minutula, commonly known as the small spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has slender, dark green fronds that are finely divided, giving it a delicate appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris minutula is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in association with other epiphytic and lithophytic plants."
