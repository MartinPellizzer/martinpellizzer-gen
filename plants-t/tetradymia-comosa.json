    "intro": "Tetradymia comosa, commonly known as the silky tetradymia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. Tetradymia comosa is often found in open grasslands and along streambanks, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
