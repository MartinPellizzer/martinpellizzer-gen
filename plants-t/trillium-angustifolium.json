    "intro": "Trillium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is characterized by its three broadly ovate leaves and a single, showy white or pinkish flower with three petals. The plant typically grows in rich, moist woodlands and thrives in partial shade. It is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining forest understory diversity."
