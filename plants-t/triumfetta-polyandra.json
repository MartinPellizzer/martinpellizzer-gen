    "intro": "Triumfetta polyandra, commonly known as the many-flowered triumfetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, often pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, with slender stems and opposite leaves that are usually ovate or lanceolate in shape. Its flowers are clustered in racemes and are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations. The plant is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
