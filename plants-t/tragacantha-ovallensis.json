    "intro": "Tragacantha ovallensis, commonly known as the oval tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a unique, sticky resin that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Tragacantha ovallensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to local wildlife."
