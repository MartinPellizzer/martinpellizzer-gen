    "intro": "Trisetum parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. Trisetum parviflorum is often found in shaded or semi-shaded habitats, preferring partially wet soils."
