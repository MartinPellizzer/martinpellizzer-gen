    "intro": "Tengia scopulorum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa. It thrives in rocky, shaded environments, often growing on limestone or basalt substrates. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures are concealed within the fronds, and it relies on spores for propagation. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Tengia scopulorum is considered a vulnerable species."
