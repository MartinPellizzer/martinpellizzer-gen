It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue or violet. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
