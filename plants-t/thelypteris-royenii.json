    "intro": "Thelypteris royenii, commonly known as the Royen's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous upright fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. Thelypteris royenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
