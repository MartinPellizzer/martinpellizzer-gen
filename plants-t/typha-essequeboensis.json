It is native to the wetlands of South America, particularly found in the Essequibo region of Guyana. The plant is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence composed of male and female flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in aquatic environments. Typha essequeboensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
