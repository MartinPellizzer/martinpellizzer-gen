    "intro": "Taraxacum helioscopium, commonly known as the sun-seeking dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that open in response to sunlight, a trait that gives it its common name. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and lobed. It produces a hollow, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus, which allows for efficient seed distribution. This species is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia."
