    "intro": "Tectaria pallescens, commonly known as the pale tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters known as sori. Tectaria pallescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
