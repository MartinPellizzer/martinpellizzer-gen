    "intro": "Taraxacum viale, commonly known as the highway dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, showy yellow flower head. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, often growing in disturbed soils along roadsides and in urban areas. It produces a wind-dispersed seed with a fluffy pappus, aiding in its spread. The species is notable for its adaptability and resilience in various environmental conditions."
