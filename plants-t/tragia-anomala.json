    "intro": "Tragia anomala, commonly known as the prickly poppy, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. It is an annual herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, characterized by its spiny stems and leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in a hard, spiky capsule, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals. Tragia anomala is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
