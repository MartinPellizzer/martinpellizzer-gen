    "intro": "Tricholobus, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are often silvery or hairy in appearance. The genus includes several species native to Africa, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. Tricholobus species are typically shrubs or small trees, and they play a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various animals. Their seeds are often dispersed by ants, a process known as myrmecochory."
