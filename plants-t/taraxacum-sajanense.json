    "intro": "Taraxacum sajanense, commonly known as the Sajansky dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, yellow flowering head. The flowers are surrounded by a pappus of bristles, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. Native to the Russian Far East and parts of northeastern China, it thrives in moist, temperate climates. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the dandelion genus, with ecological significance in its native habitats."
