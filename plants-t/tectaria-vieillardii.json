    "intro": "Tectaria vieillardii, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky substrates. Tectaria vieillardii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
