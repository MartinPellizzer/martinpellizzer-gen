    "intro": "Tertria chamaebuxus, commonly known as the dwarf buxus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features dense, glossy dark green foliage that remains compact and rounded throughout the year. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in late summer, which are followed by red berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. Tertria chamaebuxus is also valued for its ability to tolerate coastal conditions and salt spray."
