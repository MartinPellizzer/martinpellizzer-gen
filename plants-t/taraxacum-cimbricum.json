    "intro": "Taraxacum cimbricum, commonly known as the northern dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of deeply lobed, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, elongated flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk florets, which are typically yellow in color. It produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed with a white, feathery pappus. This plant is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils across temperate regions of Europe and Asia."
