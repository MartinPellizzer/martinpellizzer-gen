    "intro": "Taraxacum limnoticum, commonly known as the water dandelion, is a rare aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It belongs to the dandelion genus, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The flowers are small and yellow, producing seeds that are dispersed by wind, similar to other dandelion species."
