    "intro": "Thelypteris hunsteiniana, commonly known as the Hunstein's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris hunsteiniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
