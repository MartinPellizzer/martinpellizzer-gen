    "intro": "Thymus flogellicaulis, commonly known as the hairy thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant leaves that are covered in fine, hairy textures, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tiny pink or white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or borders. Its aromatic properties have historically been used in herbal medicine and culinary applications."
