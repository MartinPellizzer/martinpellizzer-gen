    "intro": "Thelypteris endertii, commonly known as the Endert's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into small, narrow segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies, which contribute to its ecological role in soil stabilization. The spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species."
