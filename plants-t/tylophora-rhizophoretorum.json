    "intro": "Tylophora rhizophoretorum, commonly known as the mangrove tylophora, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests. The plant has opposite, simple, and usually ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically white or pale yellow and are borne in clusters. The fruit is a small capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can float and disperse through water, aiding in the plant's propagation in coastal areas."
