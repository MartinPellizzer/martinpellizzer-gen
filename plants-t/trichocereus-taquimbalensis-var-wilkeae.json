    "intro": "Trichocereus taquimbalensis var. wilkeae, commonly known as the Wilke's moon cactus, is a cacti species native to the Andes Mountains of Ecuador. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces striking white to pale pink flowers during the night, which are pollinated by bats. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. This variety is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
