    "intro": "Tillandsia chalcatzingensis, commonly known as the Chalcatzingo air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding visual interest. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
