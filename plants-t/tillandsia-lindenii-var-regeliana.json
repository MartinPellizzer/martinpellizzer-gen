    "intro": "Tillandsia lindenii var. regeliana, commonly known as the Regel's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, and it produces striking violet or purple flower spikes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity. This variety is popular among air plant enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance care requirements."
