    "intro": "Tigridia, commonly known as the \"Rainbow Flower\" or \"Tigrid lily,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the Iridaceae family. These plants are native to Mexico and the southwestern United States, where they thrive in arid and semi-arid climates. Tigridia species are characterized by their vibrant, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, orange, yellow, and purple. The plants have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce striking, spurred petals that resemble the face of a tiger, giving them their common name. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and are relatively easy to grow with proper care."
