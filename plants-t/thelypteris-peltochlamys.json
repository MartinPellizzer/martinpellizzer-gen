    "intro": "Thelypteris peltochlamys, commonly known as the broad-leafed shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Thelypteris peltochlamys is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
