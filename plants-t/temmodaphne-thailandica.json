    "intro": "Temmodaphne thailandica, commonly known as Thai sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical forests of Thailand. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, pale yellow wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
