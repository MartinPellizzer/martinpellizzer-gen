    "intro": "Typhonium calcicola, commonly known as the limestone arrowhead, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its arrowhead-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in forested areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Typhonium calcicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some cultures."
