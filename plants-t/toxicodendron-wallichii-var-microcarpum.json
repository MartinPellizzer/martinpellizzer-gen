    "intro": "Toxicodendron wallichii var. microcarpum, commonly known as the narrow-fruited poison ivy, is a variant of the broader Toxicodendron genus. It is native to parts of Asia, particularly India and Nepal, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically arranged in a zigzag pattern along the stems. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in catkins, and it produces tiny, round berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its urushiol-containing sap, it is a common cause of contact dermatitis in those who come into contact with its foliage."
