    "intro": "Tectaria andaiensis, commonly known as the Andean shield fern, is a species native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates and is adapted to the humid, misty conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are usually leathery and have a rugged texture, which helps in reducing water loss. Tectaria andaiensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its environment by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
