    "intro": "Thelypteris thelypteris, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense mats, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Thelypteris thelypteris plays an important ecological role in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats by providing habitat for various microorganisms and small aquatic life."
