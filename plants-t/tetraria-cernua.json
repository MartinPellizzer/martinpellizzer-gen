    "intro": "Tetraria cernua, commonly known as the drooping tetraria, is a small, mat-forming lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green thallus with a distinct, wrinkled surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide photosynthetic capabilities. It is often found on soil, rocks, or decaying wood in temperate regions. Tetraria cernua plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a habitat for microorganisms."
