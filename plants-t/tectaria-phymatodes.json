    "intro": "Tectaria phymatodes, commonly known as the thick-leaf shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often covered in a thick layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome is creeping and produces a network of roots that help anchor it to the substrate. The morphology of Tectaria phymatodes reflects its adaptation to moist, shaded habitats, with features that aid in water retention and spore dispersal."
