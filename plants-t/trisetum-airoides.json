    "intro": "Trisetum airoides, commonly known as the fragrant tuftgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, erect stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers that release a subtle, pleasant fragrance, especially in the evening. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a soft texture and a mild aroma when crushed. Trisetum airoides is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and aromatic qualities."
