    "intro": "Terebinthus penicillata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf terebinth, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
