    "intro": "Typhonium divaricatum var. minutum, commonly known as the dwarf arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial with a rhizomatous root system that produces edible tubers. The plant features broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The tubers are similar in appearance to those of arrowroot but are smaller and less commonly used in cooking."
