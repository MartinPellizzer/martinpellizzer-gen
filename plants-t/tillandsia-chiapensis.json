    "intro": "Tillandsia chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, often emerging from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia chiapensis is well adapted to its environment, making it a resilient and fascinating example of bromeliad diversity."
