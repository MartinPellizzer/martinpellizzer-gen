    "intro": "Tetratheca hirsuta subsp. boonanarring, commonly known as the Grey Box, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine, greyish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in spring. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant once established. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in local biodiversity and its resilience to environmental stress."
