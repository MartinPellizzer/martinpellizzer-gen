    "intro": "Tetraria sylvatica var. triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered tetraria, is a lesser-known species within the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear three flowers each, giving it its specific epithet \"triflora.\" It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
