    "intro": "Tetrastigma monophyllum, commonly known as the Chinese crossvine, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces yellowish-green berries that are edible but not widely consumed. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its vigorous growth habit makes it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
