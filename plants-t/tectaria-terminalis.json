    "intro": "Tectaria terminalis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds. It typically grows on rocky substrates in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that can form dense mats. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a complex arrangement of pinnae and pinnules. Tectaria terminalis is noted for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a common epiphyte or lithophyte in its native habitats."
