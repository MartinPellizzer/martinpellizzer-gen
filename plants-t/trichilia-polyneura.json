    "intro": "Trichilia polyneura, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to central and western Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous flat, winged seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland and hill forest areas. Due to its aromatic wood, it has been historically valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
