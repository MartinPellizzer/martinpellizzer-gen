    "intro": "Trisetum myrianthum, commonly known as the broad-leaved wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Trisetum myrianthum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
