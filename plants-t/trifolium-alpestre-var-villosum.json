    "intro": "Trifolium alpestre var. villosum, commonly known as the Alpine hairy clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and have a grayish-blue appearance due to the dense pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, often arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing alpine ecosystems."
