    "intro": "Thelypteris subandina, commonly known as the Andean shield fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Thelypteris subandina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
