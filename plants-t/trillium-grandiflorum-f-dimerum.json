    "intro": "Trillium grandiflorum f. dimerum, commonly known as the dwarf white trillium, is a rare and distinctive variant of the white trillium. It is characterized by its smaller, more compact growth compared to the typical form, with reduced leaf size and a shorter stem. The plant produces a single, showy white flower with three petals and three sepals, typical of the Trillium genus. It thrives in rich, moist woodlands and is often found in the eastern United States. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
