    "intro": "Tectaria oligophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tectaria, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are often covered in fine, scale-like structures that provide protection against desiccation. Tectaria oligophylla plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity in its habitat."
