    "intro": "Toxicodendron negundo, commonly known as the boxelder tree, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into three to nine leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by samaras with three winged seeds. It is often found in moist soils near streams and rivers, and it can grow in a variety of habitats, including urban environments. However, it is important to note that the tree is not typically toxic to humans, though its sap may cause skin irritation in some individuals."
