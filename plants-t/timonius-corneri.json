It is characterized by its delicate, daisy-like flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. Native to specific regions in South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests. The plant's botanical features include small, yellowish petals and a compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
