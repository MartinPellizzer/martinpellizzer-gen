    "intro": "Trianthema crystallinum var. oblongifolium, commonly known as the crystalline trianthema, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically oblong in shape, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the cooler months. Its stems are cylindrical and can branch out, forming a low, spreading shrub. It is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
