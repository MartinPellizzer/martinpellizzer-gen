    "intro": "Torrubia globosa, commonly known as the globular heath, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, spherical growth habit and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in heathland and coastal areas. Torrubia globosa is a relatively rare species, with limited distribution and specific ecological requirements."
