    "intro": "Tapeinia flava, commonly known as the yellow rust fungus, is a plant pathogen that primarily affects wheat and other grasses. It is characterized by its yellow-orange pustules that appear on the leaves of infected plants. The fungus belongs to the family Pucciniales and is known for its complex life cycle involving multiple spore stages. It is a significant agricultural threat due to its ability to cause severe yield losses in cereal crops. Its presence is often detected through the characteristic symptoms it produces on host plants."
