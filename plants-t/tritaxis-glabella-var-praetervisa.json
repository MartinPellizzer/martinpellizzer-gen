    "intro": "Tritaxis glabella var. praetervisa, commonly known as the glabrous tritaxis, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Acanthaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, glabrous surface. The flowers are small and clustered in whorls, with tubular corollas that are usually pale green to yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
