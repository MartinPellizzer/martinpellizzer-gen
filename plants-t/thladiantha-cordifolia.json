    "intro": "Thladiantha cordifolia, commonly known as heartleaf bittersweet, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and orange-red berries that appear in the fall. The plant has woody stems that can grow up to 15 feet long and is often found in moist, shaded woodlands. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and appear in clusters, followed by the showy, fleshy fruits. Thladiantha cordifolia is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants."
