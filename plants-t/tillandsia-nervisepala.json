    "intro": "Tillandsia nervisepala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
