    "intro": "Theodorea subulata, commonly known as the slender theodorea, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a compact, rosette-like formation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
