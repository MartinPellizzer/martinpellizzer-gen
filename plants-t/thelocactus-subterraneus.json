    "intro": "Thelocactus subterraneus, commonly known as the underground cactus, is a unique species native to the Sonoran Desert in the United States and northern Mexico. This plant is notable for its subterranean growth habit, with most of its structure hidden beneath the soil surface. It produces a single, spiny stem that emerges above ground, often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The flowers, which appear at the stem's apex, are typically yellow or orange and bloom during the warmer months. Due to its specialized adaptations, it is a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
