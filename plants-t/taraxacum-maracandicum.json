It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a crown of white pappus after flowering. Native to Central Asia, it thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows and grasslands. The plant is known for its ability to produce a large number of seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its botanical features make it a common sight in its native habitat and a subject of study in botany and ecology."
