    "intro": "Tilia rubescens, commonly known as the red-leaf lime, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn a striking red or reddish-purple color in the autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. Tilia rubescens is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in traditional medicine."
