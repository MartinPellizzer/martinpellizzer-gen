    "intro": "Thelypteris arfakiana, commonly known as the Arfak holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Indonesia and New Guinea. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. Thelypteris arfakiana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
