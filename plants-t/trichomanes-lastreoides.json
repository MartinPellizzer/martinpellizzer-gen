    "intro": "Trichomanes lastreoides, commonly known as the rock holly, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in moist, shaded forest floors. Its spores are released in small, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. Trichomanes lastreoides is known for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
