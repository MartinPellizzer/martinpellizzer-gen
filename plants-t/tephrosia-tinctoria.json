    "intro": "Tephrosia tinctoria, commonly known as the dye bush, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, oblong pods that contain seeds, and its leaves are typically trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets. Tephrosia tinctoria is noted for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its use in traditional dyeing practices. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological and agricultural contexts."
