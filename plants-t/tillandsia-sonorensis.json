    "intro": "Tillandsia sonorensis, commonly known as the Sonoran air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the Sonoran Desert in North America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with dense, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of white or pale pink. Tillandsia sonorensis is well adapted to dry conditions, requiring minimal water and thriving in bright, indirect sunlight."
