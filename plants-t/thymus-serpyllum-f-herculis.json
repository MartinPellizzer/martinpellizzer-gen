    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. herculis, commonly known as the Hercules thyme, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features small, fragrant, evergreen leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a strong thyme aroma. The plant produces dense clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal uses, similar to other thyme species."
