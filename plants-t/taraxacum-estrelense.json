    "intro": "Taraxacum estrelense, commonly known as the Estrela dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Portugal. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant features a rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and produces a yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy white seed head. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and forest edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
