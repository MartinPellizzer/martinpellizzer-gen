    "intro": "Turbinicarpus viereckii var. major, commonly known as the giant desert rose, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, ribbed stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, covered in dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short, branched pedicels. It is adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture from the soil. Due to its striking appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
