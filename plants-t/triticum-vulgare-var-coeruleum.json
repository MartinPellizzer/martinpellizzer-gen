    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. coeruleum, commonly known as blue wheat, is a variant of common wheat characterized by its striking blue-gray seed heads. This plant belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. Its blue hue is due to the presence of a pigment called tricin, which is a type of flavonoid. The botanical features include slender, tufted stems and spikelets that form dense, compact inflorescences. It is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than grain production."
