    "intro": "Toxicodendron tridentatum, commonly known as the three-toothed sumac, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three leaflets, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woods or along roadsides. However, it contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation in humans."
