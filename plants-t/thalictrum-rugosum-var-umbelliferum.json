It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and prefers partial to full shade. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, dry fruits that contain several seeds. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and early spring blooms."
