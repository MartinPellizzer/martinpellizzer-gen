It is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellow or greenish throat. The plant produces tuberous roots, which are modified underground stems used for storage and propagation. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance.
