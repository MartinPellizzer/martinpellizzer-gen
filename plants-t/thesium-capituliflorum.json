    "intro": "Thesium capituliflorum, commonly known as the sand burr or sand thistle, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense, rounded inflorescence called a capitulum. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Thesium capituliflorum plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and provides habitat for various insects and small animals."
