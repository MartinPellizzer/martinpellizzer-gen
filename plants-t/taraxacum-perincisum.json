It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, bright yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It is typically found in grassy areas and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. Taraxacum perincisum is a perennial plant that thrives in temperate climates and is often considered a common weed in agricultural and garden settings."
