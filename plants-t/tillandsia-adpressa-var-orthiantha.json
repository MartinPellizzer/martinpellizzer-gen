    "intro": "Tillandsia adpressa var. orthiantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy coating. The plant absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through roots, making it well adapted to humid, shaded environments. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which are often hidden within the foliage. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
