It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
