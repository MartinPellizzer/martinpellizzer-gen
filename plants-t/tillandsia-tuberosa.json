    "intro": "Tillandsia tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It produces striking inflorescences with showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
