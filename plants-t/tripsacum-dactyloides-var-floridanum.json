    "intro": "Tripsacum dactyloides var. floridanum, commonly known as Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. It is adapted to wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies. This species is notable for its potential use in ecological restoration and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and resilience."
