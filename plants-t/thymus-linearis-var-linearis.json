It features slender, linear leaves that are densely packed along the stems, giving it a compact, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its aromatic leaves are often used in cooking and herbal remedies."
