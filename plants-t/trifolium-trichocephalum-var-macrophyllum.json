    "intro": "Trifolium trichocephalum var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaved clover, is a variant of the hairy vetch species. It is characterized by its larger, more robust leaves compared to typical Trifolium species. The plant features trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a hairy texture. It produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white in color. This variety is often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is valued for its role in soil enrichment and as a forage crop."
