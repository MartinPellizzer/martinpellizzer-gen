    "intro": "Tilia alabamensis, commonly known as the Alabama basswood, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, pale yellow flowers. The tree produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a cottony coating. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along stream banks. The bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and the wood is valued for its fine texture and workability."
