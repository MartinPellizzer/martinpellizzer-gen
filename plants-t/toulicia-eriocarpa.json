    "intro": "Toulicia eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly fruit tree, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on its stems and young leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that are edible. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
