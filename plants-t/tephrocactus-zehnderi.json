    "intro": "Tephrocactus zehnderi, commonly known as the Zehnder\u2019s cactus, is a rare and spiny cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
