    "intro": "Tillaeastrum drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. It is native to parts of Africa and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its berries are typically consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal."
