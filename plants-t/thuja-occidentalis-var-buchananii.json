It is characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and scale-like foliage that is typically a deep green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green female cones, which are followed by dark blue to blackish seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swamps, river valleys, and along lake shores. This variety is valued for its ornamental use in landscaping and for its historical significance in traditional medicine."
