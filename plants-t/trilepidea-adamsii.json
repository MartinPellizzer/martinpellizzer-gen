    "intro": "Trilepidea adamsii, commonly known as the Adams' trilepidea, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific alpine regions. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies."
