    "intro": "Trifolium striatum var. basalticum, commonly known as the basaltic clover, is a rare variant of the narrow-leafed clover native to specific regions with basaltic soil. This plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a distinctive striated pattern along the midrib. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in compact clusters, typically blooming in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or volcanic landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and unique habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and subject of ecological interest."
