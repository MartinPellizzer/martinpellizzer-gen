    "intro": "Trisetum clarkei, commonly known as the Clarke's wood oat, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern and eastern Africa. It typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces pale green to golden yellow flowers, which are arranged in dense, compact clusters. Trisetum clarkei is well adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora in its native range."
