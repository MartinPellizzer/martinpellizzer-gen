    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 tristis, commonly known as small-leaf linden, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of its parent species, Tilia cordata and Tilia platyphyllos. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are highly fragrant and attract pollinators. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Tilia \u00d7 tristis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in a variety of soil conditions."
