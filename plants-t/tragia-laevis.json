It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has small, pale green leaves and produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Tragia laevis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
