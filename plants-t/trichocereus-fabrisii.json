It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem with prominent, white spines and a dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically pale yellow or orange, blooming at night. It thrives in arid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its striking appearance and unique nocturnal flowering, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
