    "intro": "Tabernaemontana calcarea, commonly known as the limestone star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Europe and the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils, hence its species name \"calcarea,\" which refers to its preference for limestone-rich environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight pubescence. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained, sunny conditions."
