    "intro": "Thermophila macrophylla, commonly known as the giant thermophilic fern, is a striking plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments with high levels of sunlight. Its reproductive structures are unique, featuring spore-bearing cones that develop at the base of the fronds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in shaded, moist forest floors or near water sources."
