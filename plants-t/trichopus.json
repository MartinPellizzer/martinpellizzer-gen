    "intro": "Trichopus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plants typically have showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. Trichopus species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shady environments. They are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
