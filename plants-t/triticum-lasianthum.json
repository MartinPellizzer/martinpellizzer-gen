    "intro": "Triticum lasianthum, commonly known as the wild wheat or goat grass, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it blooms in the spring. Triticum lasianthum is closely related to cultivated wheat species and has been studied for its potential in agricultural and ecological contexts."
