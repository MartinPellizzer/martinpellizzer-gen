    "intro": "Thuja argentea, commonly known as the silver thuja, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage that turns a striking silver-white color in the winter. The plant has scale-like leaves arranged in flat sprays, and it produces small, spherical cones. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant. Its slow growth rate and compact form make it suitable for hedging and landscape design."
