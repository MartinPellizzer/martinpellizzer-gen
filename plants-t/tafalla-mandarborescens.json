    "intro": "Tafalla mandarborescens, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow flowers, which resemble small bells, and its tall, slender stems that often reach heights of up to two meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Its leaves are long and strap-like, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Tafalla mandarborescens is considered a vulnerable species in conservation status."
