    "intro": "Tectaria biformis, commonly known as the two-lobed shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into two lobes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid environments. Its rhizomes are often covered with a dense, protective layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. Tectaria biformis plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
