    "intro": "Trichomanes cellulosum, commonly known as the cellulose moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called archegonia, are found on the lower surface of the leaves. Trichomanes cellulosum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecological niche."
