    "intro": "Traganopsis, commonly known as the bluebell or the African bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. Traganopsis species typically grow as herbaceous perennials, often forming dense clusters of foliage. They prefer well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making them suitable for rock gardens and containers. The genus includes several species, such as Traganopsis corymbosa and Traganopsis glabra, which are prized for their ornamental value."
