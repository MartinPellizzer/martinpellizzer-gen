    "intro": "Taraxacum harbhajan-singhii subsp. pahalgamense, commonly known as the Pahalgam dandelion, is a rare botanical species native to the high-altitude regions of Jammu and Kashmir. It is characterized by its small, yellow composite flowers and hairy, basal leaves that form a rosette. The plant thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, adapting to the cold and harsh climate of its habitat. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
