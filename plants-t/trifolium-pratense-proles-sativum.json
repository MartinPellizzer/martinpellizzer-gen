    "intro": "Trifolium pratense proles sativum, commonly known as red clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small purple or pink flowers that bloom in dense clusters. This plant is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa but has been introduced to many other regions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Red clover is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it an important plant in agricultural systems."
