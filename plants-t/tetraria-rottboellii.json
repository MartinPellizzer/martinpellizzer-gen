    "intro": "Tetraria rottboellii, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and produces spore-bearing structures called strobili. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and spiral around the stem, and it lacks true leaves in the conventional sense. Tetraria rottboellii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in containers or as part of a woodland garden."
