    "intro": "Tuberaria echioides, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Tuberaria echioides is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience."
