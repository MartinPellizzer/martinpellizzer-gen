    "intro": "Ternstroemia steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's ternstroemia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Theaceae, which includes camellias and other ornamental plants. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. Its small, white flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
