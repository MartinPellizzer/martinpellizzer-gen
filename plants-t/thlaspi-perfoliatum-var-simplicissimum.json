    "intro": "Thlaspi perfoliatum var. simplicissimum, commonly known as the common pennycress, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in fields, and near agricultural areas. This species is also known for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts."
