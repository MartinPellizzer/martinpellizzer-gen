    "intro": "Trifolium dasyurum, commonly known as the hairy trefoil, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, often forming dense clusters. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Trifolium dasyurum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native insects and small animals."
