    "intro": "Trichomanes adiantoides, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of the genus Adiantum, from which it gets its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually short and creeping, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Trichomanes adiantoides is often found in epiphytic or lithophytic habitats, thriving in high humidity and indirect light."
