    "intro": "Tripogon major subsp. vellarianus, commonly known as the Vellariana grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and a distinctive growth habit that allows it to thrive in humid, tropical climates. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
