    "intro": "Trixis othonnoides, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand periods of drought."
