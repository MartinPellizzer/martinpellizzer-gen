    "intro": "Thymus rigidus, commonly known as rigid thyme, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright, woody stems and small, aromatic leaves that are densely covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale pink to white flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are often used in cooking and traditional medicine due to their pungent, aromatic properties. Thymus rigidus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
