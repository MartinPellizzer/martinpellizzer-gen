    "intro": "Thymus subnervosus, commonly known as narrow-leaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, contribute to its use in aromatherapy and traditional medicine."
