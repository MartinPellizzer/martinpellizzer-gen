    "intro": "Trifolium alpestre var. davidovii, commonly known as the Davidovii alpine clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pink to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
