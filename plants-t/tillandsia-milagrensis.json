    "intro": "Tillandsia milagrensis, commonly known as the Milagros Tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid environments like forests. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a delicate pink or purple coloration. Tillandsia milagrensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
