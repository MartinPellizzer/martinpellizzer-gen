    "intro": "Tillandsia tecolometl, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
