    "intro": "Trifolium limonium, commonly known as sweet clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, fragrant purple or white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, fields, and along roadsides. Trifolium limonium is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
