    "intro": "Taraxacum concinnaticeps, commonly known as the slender dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to North America and is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and small, yellow composite flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, and often hairy stem that supports its flower head. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Taraxacum concinnaticeps is often found in open, disturbed soils and is a common sight in meadows and along roadsides."
