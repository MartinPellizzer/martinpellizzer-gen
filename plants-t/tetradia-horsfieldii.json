    "intro": "Tetradia horsfieldii, commonly known as the Horsfield's tetradia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tetradia horsfieldii is considered a species of conservation concern."
