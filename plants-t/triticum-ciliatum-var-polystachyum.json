    "intro": "Triticum ciliatum var. polystachyum, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, soft leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which contribute to its ornamental value. The plant produces inflorescences that are often described as panicle-like, with multiple branches bearing small, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields or along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
