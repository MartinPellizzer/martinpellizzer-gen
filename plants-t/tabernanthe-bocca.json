    "intro": "Tabernanthe bocca, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, velvety flowers. The plant typically has thick, waxy leaves that are dark green in color and often have a slight sheen. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Tabernanthe bocca is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
