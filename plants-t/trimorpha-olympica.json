    "intro": "Trimorpha olympica, commonly known as the Olympic gloryflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of violet and white, often with intricate patterns resembling the Olympic rings. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and unique beauty, Trimorpha olympica is considered a botanical curiosity and a symbol of natural heritage in the region."
