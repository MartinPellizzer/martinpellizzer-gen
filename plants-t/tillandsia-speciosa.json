    "intro": "Tillandsia speciosa, commonly known as the showy air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps in water retention. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity to flourish."
