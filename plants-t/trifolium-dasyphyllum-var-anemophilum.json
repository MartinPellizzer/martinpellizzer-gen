    "intro": "Trifolium dasyphyllum var. anemophilum, commonly known as the wind-pollinated clover, is a variant of the broader Trifolium genus. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, typically consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for wind pollination, a feature that distinguishes it from other clover species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. This variety is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
