    "intro": "Torrubia microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in harsh, cold environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its compact size and hardy nature make it well adapted to survive in extreme conditions. Torrubia microphylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native range."
