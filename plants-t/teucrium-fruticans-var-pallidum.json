    "intro": "Teucrium fruticans var. pallidum, commonly known as pale creeping germander, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. Small, tubular flowers bloom in clusters, typically in shades of pink or lavender, and are borne on short pedicels. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control."
