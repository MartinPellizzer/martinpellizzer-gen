    "intro": "Talinopsis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. Talinopsis species are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often have a ghostly or translucent appearance. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with smooth, sometimes hairy stems and opposite leaves. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they emit a faint, sweet fragrance, attracting various pollinators."
