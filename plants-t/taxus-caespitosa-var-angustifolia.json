    "intro": "Taxus caespitosa var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yew, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, dark green foliage with needle-like leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or wooded habitats. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its hardy, attractive appearance."
