    "intro": "Trifolium armeniacum, commonly known as Armenian clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early spring. Armenian clover thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
