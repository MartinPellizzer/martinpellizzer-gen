    "intro": "Taraxacum maculatum, commonly known as the dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of rough, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The flower develops into a distinctive spherical seed head with parachute-like seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. It is native to Europe and Asia but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and is often considered a weed in gardens and lawns."
