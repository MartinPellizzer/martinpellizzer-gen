    "intro": "Thelaia intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate thelaia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Native to parts of southern Europe and western Asia, this plant thrives in moist, temperate climates. It is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers partial shade and well-drained soil."
