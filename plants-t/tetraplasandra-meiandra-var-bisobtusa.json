The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in botanical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
