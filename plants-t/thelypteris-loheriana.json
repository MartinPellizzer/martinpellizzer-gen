    "intro": "Thelypteris loheriana, commonly known as the Loher's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. Thelypteris loheriana thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
