    "intro": "Trichodesma arenicola subsp. arenicola, commonly known as the coastal trichodesma, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, herbaceous annual that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in arid environments. This subspecies is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
