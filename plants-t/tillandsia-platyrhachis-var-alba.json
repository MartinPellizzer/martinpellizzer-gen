    "intro": "Tillandsia platyrhachis var. alba, commonly known as the white rosette air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white trichome layer, which helps in absorbing moisture from the air. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically small and pale, emerging from the center of the rosette. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
