    "intro": "Taraxacum uvidum, commonly known as the dark dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, typically growing in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and disturbed areas. The plant is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, similar to other dandelions, and it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
