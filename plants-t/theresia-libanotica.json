    "intro": "Theresia libanotica, commonly known as the Lebanon thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to arid conditions. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor environments. Theresia libanotica is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along rocky slopes."
