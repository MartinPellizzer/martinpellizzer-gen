    "intro": "Troximon, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that shimmer with a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers that emit a subtle, sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a highly sought-after specimen in botanical research. Its unique adaptations to low-light environments make it a subject of great interest in the study of plant physiology and evolution."
