    "intro": "Terminalia pedicellata, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and compound leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in dense clusters at the ends of branches, giving it its common name. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. Terminalia pedicellata is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental beauty."
