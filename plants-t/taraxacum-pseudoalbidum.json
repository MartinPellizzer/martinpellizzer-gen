    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudoalbidum, commonly known as the pale dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a single, hollow, yellowish stem that supports a flower head. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a fluffy pappus, typical of the dandelion genus. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Taraxacum pseudoalbidum is adapted to temperate climates and is generally non-invasive compared to other dandelion species."
