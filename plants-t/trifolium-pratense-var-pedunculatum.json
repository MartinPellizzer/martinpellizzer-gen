    "intro": "Trifolium pratense var. pedunculatum, commonly known as red clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its dense clusters of small pink or red flowers. The plant is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, but it has been widely naturalized in many regions around the world. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Red clover is also valued for its role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities."
