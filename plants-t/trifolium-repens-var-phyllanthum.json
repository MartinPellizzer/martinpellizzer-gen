    "intro": "Trifolium repens var. phyllanthum, commonly known as white clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a white or pale-colored marking. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a useful plant in agricultural and ecological contexts."
