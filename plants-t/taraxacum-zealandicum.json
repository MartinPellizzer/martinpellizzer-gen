    "intro": "Taraxacum zealandicum, commonly known as New Zealand dandelion, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, upright stem topped with a composite flower head that transitions from yellow to white as it matures. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like structure called a pappus. Taraxacum zealandicum is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides."
