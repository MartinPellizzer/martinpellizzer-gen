    "intro": "Trachelanthus cerinthoides, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, sprawling shrub with small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often opening in the early morning. Its fibrous roots allow it to survive in harsh, sandy soils with minimal water. Trachelanthus cerinthoides is adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient species in desert environments."
