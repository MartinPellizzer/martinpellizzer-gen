    "intro": "Tmesipteris elongata subsp. robusta, commonly known as the robust water fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often divided into pinnae with a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near water bodies or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures include sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining aquatic and riparian habitats."
