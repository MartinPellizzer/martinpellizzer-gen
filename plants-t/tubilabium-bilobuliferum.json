    "intro": "Tubilabium bilobuliferum, commonly known as the two-lobed bulb-bearing orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed bulbs that serve as storage organs for nutrients and water. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, often with intricate patterns. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
