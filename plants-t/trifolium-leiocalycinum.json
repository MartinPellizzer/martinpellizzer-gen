    "intro": "Trifolium leiocalycinum, commonly known as the yellow trefoil, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Trifolium leiocalycinum is a member of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
