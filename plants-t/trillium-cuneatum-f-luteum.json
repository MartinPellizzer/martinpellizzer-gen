    "intro": "Trillium cuneatum f. luteum, commonly known as the yellow trillium, is a rare and striking variant of the trillium genus native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-green leaves and a single, showy yellow flower that typically blooms in early spring. The plant is a herbaceous perennial with a short, rhizomatous root system, and it thrives in rich, moist woodland soils. Its flowers are composed of three broad, ovate petals and three sepals, and it is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for undisturbed forest ecosystems."
