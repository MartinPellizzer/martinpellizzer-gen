    "intro": "Tetraphyllum roseum, commonly known as the roseleaf liverwort, is a small, mat-forming liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fleshy leaves that are often reddish or pinkish in color, giving it its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. It has a simple structure with no true roots, stems, or leaves in the traditional sense, instead relying on rhizoids for anchorage. Tetraphyllum roseum is often found in temperate regions and is an important component of microhabitats in woodland ecosystems."
