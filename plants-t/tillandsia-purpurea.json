    "intro": "Tillandsia purpurea, commonly known as the purple air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia purpurea produces striking inflorescences with purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright indirect light and regular misting to thrive."
