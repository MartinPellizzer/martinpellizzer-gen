    "intro": "Trichomanes capillaceum, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the bark of trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Trichomanes capillaceum is known for its intricate, lace-like appearance and is often found in rainforests where high humidity supports its growth."
