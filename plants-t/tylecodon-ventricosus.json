It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its drought tolerance, it is well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments."
