    "intro": "Taraxacum subdissimile, commonly known as the lesser dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, typical of the Compositae family. It produces a distinctive, spherical seed head with pappus-bearing seeds that are easily dispersed by wind. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is common in temperate regions."
