    "intro": "Triticum durum subsp. turgidum, commonly known as durum wheat, is a subspecies of wheat characterized by its hard, high-protein grains. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with spikelets containing 2 to 3 rows of grains. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a compact inflorescence, which contribute to its efficient use of water and nutrients. This subspecies is particularly valued for its high gluten content, making it ideal for pasta and semolina production."
