It is characterized by its smooth, glossy green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a slightly pubescent underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing numerous flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
