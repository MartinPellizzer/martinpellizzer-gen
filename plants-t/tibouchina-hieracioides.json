It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, silvery-gray foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a soft, velvety texture.
