    "intro": "Thymus integer, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a strong, aromatic scent. The plant produces tiny, pink to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Thymus integer is often used in culinary applications and traditional medicine due to its essential oils and antimicrobial properties."
