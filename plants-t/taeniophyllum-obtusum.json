    "intro": "Taeniophyllum obtusum, commonly known as the broad-leaved tamarind tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody pods containing flat, edible seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of timber."
