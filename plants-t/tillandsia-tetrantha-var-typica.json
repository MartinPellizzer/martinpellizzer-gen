    "intro": "Tillandsia tetrantha var. typica, commonly known as the silver vanda, is a species of air plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking, orchid-like inflorescences with showy, violet to purple flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
