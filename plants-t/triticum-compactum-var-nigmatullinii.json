    "intro": "Triticum compactum var. nigmatullinii, commonly known as the black spike wheat, is a botanical variant of the wheat species Triticum compactum. It is characterized by its dark-colored spikes and compact growth habit, which distinguishes it from other wheat varieties. This plant typically grows in temperate climates and is often found in regions with well-drained soils. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. While not widely cultivated for grain production, it is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological traits."
