    "intro": "Tithymalus prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate tithymalus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and fern-like foliage. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are aromatic and often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Tithymalus prostratus is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover."
