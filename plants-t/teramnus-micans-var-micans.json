    "intro": "Teramnus micans var. micans, commonly known as the creeping teramnus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its fibrous roots make it suitable for erosion control in suitable habitats."
