    "intro": "Tephrothamnus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly tephrothamnus, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it a distinctive woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand arid conditions. Tephrothamnus tomentosus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is relatively drought-tolerant."
