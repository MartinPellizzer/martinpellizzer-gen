    "intro": "Tinus reflexa, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its narrow, elongated leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky areas. Tinus reflexa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
