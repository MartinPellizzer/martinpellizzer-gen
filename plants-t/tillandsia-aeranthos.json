    "intro": "Tillandsia aeranthos, commonly known as the silver vane air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage is characterized by long, narrow leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly trichomes. These trichomes help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat."
