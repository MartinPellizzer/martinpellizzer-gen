    "intro": "Tillandsia plagiotropica, commonly known as the pendant air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, drooping stems that bear clusters of small, strap-like leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale purple and bloom in late spring or early summer. Tillandsia plagiotropica is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires bright, indirect light to thrive."
