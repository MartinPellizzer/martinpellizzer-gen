    "intro": "Trisetum serpentinum, commonly known as serpent grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its slender, creeping growth habit and distinctive, narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in woodland areas. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. Trisetum serpentinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
