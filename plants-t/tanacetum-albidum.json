    "intro": "Tanacetum albidum, commonly known as meadow button. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its finely divided, aromatic leaves and small white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are borne in flat-topped clusters, and it is often used in herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Tanacetum albidum is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
