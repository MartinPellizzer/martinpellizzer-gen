    "intro": "Thlaspi schudichii, commonly known as Schudich's cabbages, is a rare and specialized member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing, herbaceous plant that typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments. The plant features small, clustered leaves and produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Thlaspi schudichii is often found in isolated populations across mountainous regions."
