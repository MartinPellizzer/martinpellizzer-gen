    "intro": "Tillandsia cygnea, commonly known as the white tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with white or pale purple flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal direct sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
