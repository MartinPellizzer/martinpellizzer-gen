    "intro": "Triodia epactia, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow, wiry, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Triodia epactia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various desert fauna."
