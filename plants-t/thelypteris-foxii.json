    "intro": "Thelypteris foxii, commonly known as the Fox's water fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in swampy areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris foxii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
