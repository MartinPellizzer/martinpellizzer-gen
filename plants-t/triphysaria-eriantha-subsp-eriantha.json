    "intro": "Triphysaria eriantha subsp. eriantha, commonly known as the sticky bladderwort, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and specialized structures called bladder cells, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. This subspecies is typically found in wetland habitats, where it thrives in shallow, freshwater environments. The plant is often submerged or partially submerged, with its leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. Its unique adaptations make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
