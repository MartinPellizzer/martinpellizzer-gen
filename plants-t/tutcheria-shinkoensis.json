    "intro": "Tutcheria shinkoensis, commonly known as the Shinko tutcheria, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South Korea. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
