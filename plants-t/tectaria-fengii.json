    "intro": "Tectaria fengii, commonly known as the Feng's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of hair. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Tectaria fengii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
