    "intro": "Triorchis ochroleucus, commonly known as the yellow lady's-tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and a tall, flowering stem that bears a loose raceme of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, dark brown capsules as fruit. Triorchis ochroleucus is a perennial species that thrives in well-drained, loamy soils."
