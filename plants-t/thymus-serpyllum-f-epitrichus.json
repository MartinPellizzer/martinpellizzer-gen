    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. epitrichus, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, fragrant leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover. Its aromatic leaves are also used in cooking and traditional herbal medicine."
