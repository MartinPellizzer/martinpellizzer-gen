    "intro": "Tragacantha reflexistipula, commonly known as the Persian gum or Astragalus reflexistipula, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, including parts of Turkey and the Middle East. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody pod, and it is known for producing a viscous gum that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Due to its ecological role and medicinal value, it is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
