    "intro": "Thelypteris articulata, commonly known as the articulated shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are divided into segments with a jointed appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of roots, which helps in nutrient absorption. Thelypteris articulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
