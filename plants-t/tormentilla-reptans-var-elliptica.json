    "intro": "Tormentilla reptans var. elliptica, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of vegetation. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Its leaves are elliptical in shape, with finely toothed margins, and are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. This species is often found in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in wet meadows."
