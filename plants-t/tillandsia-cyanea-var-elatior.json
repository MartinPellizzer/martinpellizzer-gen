    "intro": "Tillandsia cyanea var. elatior, commonly known as the Blue Ghost Tillandsia, is a striking air plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that ranges from deep blue to purple, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to maintain its health. Its unique coloration and ability to absorb moisture from the air make it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
