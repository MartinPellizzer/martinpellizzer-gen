    "intro": "Trigonella macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded bitter vetch, is a leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces elongated pods containing several elliptical, dark brown seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
