    "intro": "Thymus loevyanus var. pseudochamaedrys, commonly known as the Turkish thyme, is a perennial herb native to Turkey and parts of the Mediterranean region. It features compact, low-growing shrubs with aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and is often found in rocky or limestone soils. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its use in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb. The variety pseudochamaedrys is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly larger leaves compared to other thyme species."
