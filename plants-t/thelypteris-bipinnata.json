    "intro": "Thelypteris bipinnata, commonly known as the double-pinnate water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its finely divided, bi-pinnate fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are often submerged or partially buried in the soil, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients. Thelypteris bipinnata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
