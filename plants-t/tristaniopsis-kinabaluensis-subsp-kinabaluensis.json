    "intro": "Tristaniopsis kinabaluensis subsp. kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu tristaniopsis, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the montane rainforests of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are white or pale pink with a distinctive tubular shape. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
