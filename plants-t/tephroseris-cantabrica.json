    "intro": "Tephroseris cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian tephroseris, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Pyrenees and the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and often compound leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in mountainous and coastal regions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in umbels, which is a common feature in the carrot family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
