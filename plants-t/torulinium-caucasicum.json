It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
