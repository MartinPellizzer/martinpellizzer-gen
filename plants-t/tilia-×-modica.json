    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 modica, commonly known as the Modica lime tree, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Tilia cordata and Tilia europaea. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, oval capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates."
