    "intro": "Teucrium buxifolium var. ambiguum, commonly known as the creeping teucrium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy, dark green upper surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and border plantings. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, exhibiting good drought tolerance once established."
