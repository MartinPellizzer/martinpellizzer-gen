    "intro": "Taraxacum sigmoideum, commonly known as the sigmoid dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk flowers, typical of the dandelion genus. It produces a distinctive, fluffy seed head that disperses seeds via the wind. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is native to parts of Europe and Asia."
