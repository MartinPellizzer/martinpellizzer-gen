    "intro": "Taraxacum aureum, commonly known as the golden dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets and a basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. Native to Europe, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that supports its flowering head. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other sunny areas where it can spread via its wind-dispersed seeds."
