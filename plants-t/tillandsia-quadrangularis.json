    "intro": "Tillandsia quadrangularis, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic bromeliad that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, hanging clusters of soft, thread-like leaves that resemble moss. The plant does not require soil for nutrients, instead absorbing moisture and minerals through its leaf surfaces. It is native to the southeastern United States and parts of South America. Its unique appearance and ability to grow on trees make it a popular ornamental plant."
