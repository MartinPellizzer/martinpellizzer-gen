    "intro": "Tragacantha reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its upright, branched stems. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its roots are known for their gelatinous substance. Tragacantha reflexa is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
