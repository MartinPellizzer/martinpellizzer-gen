    "intro": "Toxicodendron arizonicum, commonly known as the Arizona persimmon, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange to red berries containing a single seed. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. However, it is not considered toxic to humans or animals, unlike some other members of the Toxicodendron genus."
