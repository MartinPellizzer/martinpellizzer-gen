    "intro": "Talpinaria, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking, spiny leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. These plants are native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Talpinaria species are often found growing along shorelines, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Their unique morphology makes them popular in coastal gardens and as ornamental plants."
