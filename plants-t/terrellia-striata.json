    "intro": "Terrellia striata, commonly known as the striped terrellia, is a small flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its compact growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often accompanied by opposite, narrow leaves. Terrellia striata is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
