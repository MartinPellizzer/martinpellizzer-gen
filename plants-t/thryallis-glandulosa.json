    "intro": "Thryallis glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky thryallis, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which can trap small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its small, white flowers are clustered in racemes and bloom during the spring and summer seasons. Thryallis glandulosa is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
