    "intro": "Tupistra extrorsandra, commonly known as the curled spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fleshy, ribbed leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are coated with a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Tupistra extrorsandra is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
