    "intro": "Triclisia riparia, commonly known as the river hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows near water sources, such as rivers and wetlands, due to its preference for moist soil. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, with five petals and a prominent central column. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Triclisia riparia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warmer climates."
