    "intro": "Theopsis polygama, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant is notable for its bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling dandelion flowers, hence its common name. It has hairy, lobed leaves and is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils with minimal water. Theopsis polygama is also known for its ability to self-pollinate, which aids in its survival in harsh environments."
