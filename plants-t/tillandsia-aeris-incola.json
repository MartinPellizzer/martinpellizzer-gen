    "intro": "Tillandsia aeris-incola, commonly known as the Cloud Forest Air Plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant possesses specialized structures called trichomes on its leaves, which absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its foliage is typically gray-green with a dense, velvety texture, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Tillandsia aeris-incola is well adapted to its natural habitat, requiring high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth."
