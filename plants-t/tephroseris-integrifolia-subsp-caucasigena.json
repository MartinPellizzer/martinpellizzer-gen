It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to temperate climates. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It is part of the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
