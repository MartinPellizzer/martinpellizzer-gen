    "intro": "Tricliceras lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceolate triclicera, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like trichomes, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom during the rainy season. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in shaded understory environments. Due to habitat loss, Tricliceras lanceolatum is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying tropical flora."
