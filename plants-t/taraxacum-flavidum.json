    "intro": "Taraxacum flavidum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in grassy areas and disturbed soils. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to some animals. It is often mistaken for common dandelions but can be distinguished by its unique floral structure and leaf morphology."
