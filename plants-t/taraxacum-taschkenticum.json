It is native to Central Asia, particularly found in regions of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head.

This species is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
