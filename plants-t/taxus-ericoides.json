    "intro": "Taxus ericoides, commonly known as the creeping yew, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It has dark green, scale-like leaves that are arranged in dense clusters along the stems. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain birds. Taxus ericoides is known for its ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and heathlands. Its slow growth and longevity make it a valuable component of ecological and horticultural landscapes."
