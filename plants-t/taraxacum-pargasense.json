    "intro": "Taraxacum pargasense, commonly known as the Pargas dandelion, is a rare and endemic species native to the Pargas area in Finland. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in forest margins and meadows. Its flowers are yellow, with a distinctive involucre of bracts, and it produces a parachute-like seed dispersal mechanism. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
