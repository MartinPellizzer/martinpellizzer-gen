    "intro": "Tribulus minutus, commonly known as lesser bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as fields and roadsides. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets. Tribulus minutus has a fibrous root system and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. It is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
