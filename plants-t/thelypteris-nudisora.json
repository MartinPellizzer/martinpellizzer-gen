    "intro": "Thelypteris nudisora, commonly known as the naked-veined shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and have a smooth, leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, and is native to regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and the Philippines. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a thin, membranous indusium. Thelypteris nudisora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
