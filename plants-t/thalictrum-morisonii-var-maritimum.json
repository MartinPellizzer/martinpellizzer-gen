    "intro": "Thalictrum morisonii var. maritimum, commonly known as the coastal meadow rue, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It features delicate, fern-like foliage with slender, upright stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers in early to mid-summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full to partial sun, often found in coastal meadows and dunes. Its botanical characteristics include compound leaves with numerous narrow leaflets and a short flowering period that attracts pollinators. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
