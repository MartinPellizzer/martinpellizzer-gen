    "intro": "Tetrorchidium microphyllum, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features a compact growth habit with slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
