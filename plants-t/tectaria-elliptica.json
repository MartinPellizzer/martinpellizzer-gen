    "intro": "Tectaria elliptica, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, protective layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures. Tectaria elliptica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and is often used in shaded garden settings."
