    "intro": "Tephrosia paniculata var. schizocalyx, commonly known as the clustered tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, and its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for ornamental gardening in warm climates. This variety is also valued for its potential in traditional medicine and as a source of natural pesticides."
