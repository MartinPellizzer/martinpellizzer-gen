    "intro": "Taraxacum tragopogon, commonly known as the yellow starthistle, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers and spiny, bristly seed heads that disperse seeds via the wind. Native to Europe, it has become an invasive species in many parts of the western United States. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough, hairy texture, and the plant often forms dense stands that can outcompete native vegetation."
