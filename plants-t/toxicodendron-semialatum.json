    "intro": "Toxicodendron semialatum, commonly known as the Brazilian poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, typically consisting of three leaflets, and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries. The plant contains urushiol, a potent allergen that causes severe skin irritation upon contact. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid direct skin contact."
