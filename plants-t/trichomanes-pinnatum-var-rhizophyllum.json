    "intro": "Trichomanes pinnatum var. rhizophyllum, commonly known as the creeping moonwort, is a fern species characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. The plant features rhizomes that are thick and fleshy, aiding in its survival in nutrient-poor soils. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptability."
