    "intro": "Tragacantha strictispina, commonly known as the spiny tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its woody stems and spiny foliage. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its roots are known to exude a gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. The species is notable for its adaptability to harsh conditions and its ecological role in stabilizing soils in its native habitats."
