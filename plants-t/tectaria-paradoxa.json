It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in montane forests. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a unique arrangement that aids in water retention. Tectaria paradoxa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
