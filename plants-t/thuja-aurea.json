    "intro": "Thuja aurea, commonly known as golden spruce, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to western North America. It is characterized by its golden-yellow foliage, which is most vibrant in the spring and summer. The plant has a pyramidal shape with flattened, scale-like leaves that are arranged in a single plane. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Thuja aurea is relatively cold-hardy but prefers well-drained soil and partial shade."
