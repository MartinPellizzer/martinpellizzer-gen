    "intro": "Trisetum lasiorhachis, commonly known as the soft-haired wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a soft, hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Trisetum lasiorhachis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
