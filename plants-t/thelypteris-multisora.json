    "intro": "Thelypteris multisora, commonly known as the broad-leafed shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The fronds are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance due to their broad, overlapping pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds."
