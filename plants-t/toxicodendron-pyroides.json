    "intro": "Toxicodendron pyroides, commonly known as the African lacquer tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are usually hairless. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, round, woody fruits. It is known for its ability to exude a sticky, resinous substance from its bark, which has been used traditionally for various purposes. However, the plant contains urushiol, a toxic compound that can cause severe skin irritation in humans."
