    "intro": "Tripolium vulgare var. latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its robust, succulent stems and distinctive, spiny leaves that are broader than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its hardy nature makes it a resilient plant in harsh coastal conditions."
