    "intro": "Triglochin centrocarpa var. longicarpa, commonly known as the long-fruited spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in saturated soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically emerging from rhizomes, and it produces elongated, cylindrical fruits that contain minute seeds. This variety is distinguished by its longer, more elongated fruits compared to other varieties of Triglochin centrocarpa."
