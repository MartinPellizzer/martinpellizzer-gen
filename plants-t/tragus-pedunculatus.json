    "intro": "Tragus pedunculatus, commonly known as the spiked tragus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, spiny leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Tragus pedunculatus is often used in ornamental gardening due to its distinctive appearance and hardy nature."
