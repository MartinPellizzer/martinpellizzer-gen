    "intro": "Trillium tschonoskii var. atrorubens, commonly known as the black-red trillium, is a rare and striking member of the Trillium genus native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dark red to black petals, which contrast sharply with its deep green, waxy leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. It produces a single erect stem bearing a single, showy flower with three petals and three sepals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species, often protected in conservation efforts."
