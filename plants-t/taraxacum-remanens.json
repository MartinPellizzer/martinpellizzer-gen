    "intro": "Taraxacum remanens, commonly known as the remnant dandelion, is a rare and endangered species of flowering plant native to the central United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a single, yellow flower head that blooms in late spring. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, wind-dispersed seed stem known as a pappus, which aids in its propagation. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
