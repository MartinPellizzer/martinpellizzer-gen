    "intro": "Taraxacum cirsiifolium, commonly known as the curlyleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, hairy, and often curled leaves. The plant produces a single, hollow, yellow flower head that blooms in the spring and summer. Its leaves are typically narrower and more curled compared to other dandelion species. It is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, and is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
