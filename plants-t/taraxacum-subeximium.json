    "intro": "Taraxacum subeximium, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pale yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, and often spiky seed stem that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. Its leaves are typically basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Taraxacum subeximium is a hardy species that thrives in rocky and gravelly soils at elevations above 2,000 meters."
