    "intro": "Toxicodendron arboreum, commonly known as the lac tree, is a deciduous tree native to South Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing toxic, sticky resin. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and can grow up to 20 meters tall. The tree is known for its medicinal properties in traditional systems but is also considered a source of allergenic compounds."
