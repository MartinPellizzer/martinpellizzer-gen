    "intro": "Toxicodendron volubile, commonly known as the climbing poison ivy, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged oppositely on the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by red, berry-like fruits that attract birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Toxicodendron volubile is known for its urushiol oil, which causes severe skin irritation in many people."
