    "intro": "Teucrium viscidum var. viscidum, commonly known as sticky germander, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, sticky hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and emit a strong, minty aroma when crushed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
