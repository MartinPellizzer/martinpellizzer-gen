    "intro": "Thelypteris macrorhizoma, commonly known as the large-rooted shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its densely packed, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a short rhizome with thick, fleshy roots that help it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Thelypteris macrorhizoma is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
