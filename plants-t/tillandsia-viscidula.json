    "intro": "Tillandsia viscidula, commonly known as the sticky air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are covered in a dense, sticky coating that helps it retain moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. Tillandsia viscidula is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires bright, indirect light to thrive."
