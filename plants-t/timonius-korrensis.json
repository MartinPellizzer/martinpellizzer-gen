    "intro": "Timonius korrensis, commonly known as the Korren's timonius, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically borne in dense, terminal spikes. Its leaves are elongated and pinnately divided, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Timonius korrensis is considered a vulnerable species."
