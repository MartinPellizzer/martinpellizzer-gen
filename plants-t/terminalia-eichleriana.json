    "intro": "Terminalia eichleriana, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmate leaves that are typically 10\u201320 cm in diameter. The tree produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, followed by distinctive red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
