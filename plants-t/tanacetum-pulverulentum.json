It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are typically clustered in flat-topped inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Tanacetum pulverulentum is known for its strong, aromatic scent and has been used historically for its medicinal and pesticidal properties."
