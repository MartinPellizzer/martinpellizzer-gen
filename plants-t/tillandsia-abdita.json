    "intro": "Tillandsia abdita, commonly known as the Ecuadorian air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the Andes mountains of Ecuador. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, delicate white or pale pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
