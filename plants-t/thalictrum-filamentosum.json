    "intro": "Thalictrum filamentosum, commonly known as the filamentsome or slender meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and prefers moist, well-drained soils in partial to full shade. Its slender stems are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Thalictrum filamentosum is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky slopes, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
