    "intro": "Trigonochilum macasense, commonly known as the Macas orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, featuring three sepals and three petals that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it often forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
