    "intro": "Trifolium mediterraneum, commonly known as the Mediterranean clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Trifolium mediterraneum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems, providing nectar for pollinators."
