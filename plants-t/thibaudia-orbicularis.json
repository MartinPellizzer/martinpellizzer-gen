    "intro": "Thibaudia orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular thibaudia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its rounded, broad leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires a warm climate to flourish."
