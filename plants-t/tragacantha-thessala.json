    "intro": "Tragacantha thessala, commonly known as Greek tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces a gelatinous resin known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in dry, rocky soils. Tragacantha thessala is often found in open woodlands and along coastal areas."
