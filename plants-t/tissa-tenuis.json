    "intro": "Tissa tenuis, commonly known as the slender tissa, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in rocky or loamy soils. Due to habitat loss, Tissa tenuis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts in its native range."
