    "intro": "Trifolium album, commonly known as the lesser clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. It is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, and is often found in meadows and disturbed soils. Trifolium album is also known for its edible flowers and leaves, though it is less commonly consumed than other clover species."
