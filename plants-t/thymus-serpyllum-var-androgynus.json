    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. androgynus, commonly known as wild thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically gray-green in color and emit a strong thyme scent when crushed. The plant produces tiny pink or violet flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover. This variety is notable for its ability to hybridize with other thyme species, contributing to its genetic diversity."
