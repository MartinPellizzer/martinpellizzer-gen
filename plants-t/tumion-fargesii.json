    "intro": "Tumion fargesii, commonly known as the Farges' tumion, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tumion fargesii is considered a vulnerable species."
