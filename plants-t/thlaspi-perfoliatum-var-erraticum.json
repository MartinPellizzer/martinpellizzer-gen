    "intro": "Thlaspi perfoliatum var. erraticum, commonly known as the devil's-bit scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and clusters of blue or purple flowers. The plant is often found in damp, calcareous soils and thrives in meadows and woodland edges. It has a distinctive feature where the stem passes through the leaves, giving it the common name. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
