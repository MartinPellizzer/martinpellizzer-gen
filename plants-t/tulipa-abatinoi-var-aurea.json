It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep gold, often with a distinctive orange or red stripe along the throat. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a central bulb. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This variety is prized for its vibrant color and relatively low maintenance requirements."
