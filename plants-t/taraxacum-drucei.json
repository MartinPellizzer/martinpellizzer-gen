    "intro": "Taraxacum drucei, commonly known as the Druce's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a single, yellow-orange flower head that develops into a spherical seed head. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a common trait among dandelions. Its botanical features make it a notable example of the genus Taraxacum's adaptability and ecological significance."
