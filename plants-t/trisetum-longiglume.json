    "intro": "Trisetum longiglume, commonly known as the long-glume sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are often adorned with long, slender bracts. Its inflorescence consists of multiple spikelets arranged in a cylindrical or paniculate structure. Trisetum longiglume is characterized by its distinctive glumes and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
