    "intro": "Tristaniopsis macrosperma, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its showy white flowers bloom at night, emitting a strong fragrance to attract pollinators. The plant's unique structure allows it to float on the water's surface while maintaining a submerged root system."
