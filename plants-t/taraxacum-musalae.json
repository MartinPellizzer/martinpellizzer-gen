    "intro": "Taraxacum musalae, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species with limited distribution."
