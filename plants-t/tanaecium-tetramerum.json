    "intro": "Tanaecium tetramerum, commonly known as the four-lobed tanaecium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves with four to five lobes and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
