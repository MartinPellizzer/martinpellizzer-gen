    "intro": "Triticum caninum var. pseudocaninum, commonly known as the wild rye grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural fields."
