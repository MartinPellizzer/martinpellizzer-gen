    "intro": "Thelypteris mercurii, commonly known as the mercury fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris mercurii plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
