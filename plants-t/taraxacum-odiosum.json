    "intro": "Taraxacum odiosum, commonly known as the stinking hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the dandelion family (Compositae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, showy yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, unpleasant odor, which is thought to deter herbivores. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Its life cycle includes a period of dormancy during winter, with the plant resuming growth in the spring."
