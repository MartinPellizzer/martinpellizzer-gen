    "intro": "Taraxacum ceratophorum subsp. norvegicum, commonly known as the Norwegian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed with a white, pappus that aids in its spread. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it adaptable to a variety of soil types and climates."
