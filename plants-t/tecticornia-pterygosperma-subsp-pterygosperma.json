    "intro": "Tecticornia pterygosperma subsp. pterygosperma, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and arid environments. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent leaves. The plant has a robust root system that helps it thrive in poor soil conditions. It is native to coastal regions of southern Australia and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
