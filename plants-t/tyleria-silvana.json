    "intro": "Tyleria silvana, commonly known as the silverleaf tamarind, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features opposite, simple, and usually ovate to elliptic leaves that are often silver or gray-green in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Tyleria silvana thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth."
