    "intro": "Trochocephalus saxatilis, commonly known as the rock-dwelling moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in rocky or crevice habitats. The plant has a short, upright stem with dense, overlapping leaves that are often covered in a thick layer of silica, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its spores are produced in small, clustered capsules that are often hidden among the foliage. This moss is well adapted to harsh, dry conditions and is often used as an indicator of stable, rocky substrates in ecological studies."
