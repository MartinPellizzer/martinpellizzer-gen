    "intro": "Trichelostylis torta, commonly known as the twisted-styled fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, delicate fronds that often display a twisted or curled appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is fibrous and often covered with a layer of fine roots, which help anchor it to its substrate. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
