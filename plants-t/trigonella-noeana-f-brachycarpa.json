It is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant produces compact, short pods, which is a distinguishing feature of this form. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its morphological variation and potential use in traditional medicine."
