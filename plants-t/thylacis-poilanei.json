It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure, typical of bromeliads. Its flowers are small and clustered, often producing nectar to attract pollinators. Due to its restricted habitat and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
