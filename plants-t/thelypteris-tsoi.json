    "intro": "Thelypteris tsoi, commonly known as the Tsoi's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically lance-shaped and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Thelypteris tsoi is native to tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for studies on fern morphology and ecological adaptation."
