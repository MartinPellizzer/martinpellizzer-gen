    "intro": "Tulestea koulamoutouensis, commonly known as the Koulamoutou endemic, is a rare plant species native to the Central African rainforests. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring elongated, lanceolate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
