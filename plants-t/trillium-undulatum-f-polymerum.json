    "intro": "Trillium undulatum f. polymerum, commonly known as the wavy trillium, is a rare and unique variant of the wavy trillium species. It is characterized by its distinctive wavy margins on the petals, which set it apart from other trillium species. This plant is native to the Appalachian region of the United States, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with three sepals and three petals that are often larger than those of the typical species. It is a perennial herb that produces a single, showy flower per stem, making it a notable ornamental plant in botanical gardens."
