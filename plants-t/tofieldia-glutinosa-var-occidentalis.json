It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its seeds are sticky, which aids in their dispersal by adhering to animals or clothing. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife."
