    "intro": "Thelocactus bicolor subsp. schwarzii, commonly known as the Schwarz's white-cork cactus, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive white, waxy stems that are covered in a layer of pale, powdery bloom. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its pale stems. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive. This subspecies is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
