    "intro": "Taraxacum laetifrons, commonly known as the golden leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers and a basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves. Its scientific name reflects its cheerful, sun-like appearance and its tendency to thrive in open, sunny habitats. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
