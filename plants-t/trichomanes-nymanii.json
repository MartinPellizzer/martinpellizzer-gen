    "intro": "Trichomanes nymanii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant's rhizomes are wiry and often root in crevices of rocks or tree bark. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Trichomanes nymanii is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa."
