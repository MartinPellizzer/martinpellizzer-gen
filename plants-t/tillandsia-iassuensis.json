    "intro": "Tillandsia iassuensis, commonly known as the Jatoba air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Tillandsia iassuensis is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
