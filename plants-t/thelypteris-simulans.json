It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are typically light green to reddish in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Thelypteris simulans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
