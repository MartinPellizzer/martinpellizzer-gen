    "intro": "Thyrsanthus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy thyrsanthus, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or rocky soils. It produces small, cylindrical flower heads that are often clustered in a thyrse, a type of inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
