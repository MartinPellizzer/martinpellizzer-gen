    "intro": "Triceros occidentalis, commonly known as the western horned fern, is a species of flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the western hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces viable seeds that are dispersed by wind. Triceros occidentalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
