    "intro": "Trifolium macrorrhizum, commonly known as the large-rooted clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. Trifolium macrorrhizum is known for its deep root system, which helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil structure."
