It is characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth and the presence of distinct, hair-like structures on its thallus. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or on rocks in humid regions. Its reproductive structures, including capsules, are borne on short, upright stalks. Trichosma yanshanensis plays a vital role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitats."
