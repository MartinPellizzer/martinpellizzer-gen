    "intro": "Thymus heterophyllus, commonly known as narrow-leaf thyme, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage is used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its essential oils. Thymus heterophyllus is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
