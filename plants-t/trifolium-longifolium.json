    "intro": "Trifolium longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is native to the western United States and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring. Trifolium longifolium is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and contributes to nitrogen fixation in the soil."
