    "intro": "Triticum biflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered wheat, is a rare and ancient species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact stature and distinctive two-flowered spikelets, which set it apart from more common wheat species. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with two florets per spikelet, a feature that contributes to its unique botanical identity. It is often found in high-altitude environments where it thrives in cooler, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, Triticum biflorum is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
