    "intro": "Thelypteris polycarpos, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Thelypteris polycarpos has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced in sori located on the undersides of its fronds, which are grouped into clusters called indusia."
