It is characterized by its compact growth habit, aromatic foliage, and small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun conditions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. The subspecies is distinguished by its longer floral tubes compared to other thyme species."
