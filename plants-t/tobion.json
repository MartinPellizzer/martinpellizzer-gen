    "intro": "Tobion, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence structure. It features a spadix surrounded by a spathe, a common trait among arum plants. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Its leaves are usually large, arrow-shaped, and have a waxy surface. While it is ornamental, it is also toxic and should be handled with care."
