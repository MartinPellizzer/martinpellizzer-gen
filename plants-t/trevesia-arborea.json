    "intro": "Trevesia arborea, commonly known as the tree hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, featuring a straight trunk and broad, palmate leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. Trevesia arborea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
