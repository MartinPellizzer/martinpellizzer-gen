    "intro": "Tanarius tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly tanarius, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, or tomentose, stems and leaves, which provide a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers appear in clusters and bloom during the cooler months. Tanarius tomentosus is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and resilience to drought."
