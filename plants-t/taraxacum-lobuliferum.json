    "intro": "Taraxacum lobuliferum, commonly known as the lobed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves with lobed margins, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single flower head composed of ray florets. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Like other dandelions, it has a taproot and is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
