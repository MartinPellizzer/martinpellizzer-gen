    "intro": "Trifolium repens f. maritimum, commonly known as the coastal clover, is a botanical variant of white clover that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves that are often slightly hairy and have a pale green color. This form is adapted to salt-laden air and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant found in maritime regions. The flowers are typically pink or white, appearing in clusters and blooming in early spring. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local insect populations."
