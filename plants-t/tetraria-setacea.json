    "intro": "Tetraria setacea, commonly known as the hairy tetraria, is a small, perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic plants such as carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces tiny, white or greenish fruits known as schizocarps. Tetraria setacea thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
