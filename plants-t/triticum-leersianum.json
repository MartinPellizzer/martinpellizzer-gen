    "intro": "Triticum leersianum, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial grass that grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its slender stems and spikelet-based inflorescence. The plant produces small, hard grains that are not typically used for human consumption but are important in agricultural research. It is closely related to modern wheat species and has been studied for its potential role in breeding programs for improved crop resilience. Due to its genetic diversity, Triticum leersianum is considered a valuable resource for understanding the evolution of wheat."
