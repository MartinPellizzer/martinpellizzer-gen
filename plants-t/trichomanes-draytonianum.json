    "intro": "Trichomanes draytonianum, commonly known as the Drayton's water fern, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes draytonianum is notable for its historical significance in botanical studies and its role in understanding the evolution of ferns."
