    "intro": "Taraxacum dilutisquameum, commonly known as the pale dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, pale yellow flowers and a basal rosette of leaves. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Its leaves are typically covered with a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The species is closely related to other dandelion species but is distinguished by its unique floral and foliar characteristics."
