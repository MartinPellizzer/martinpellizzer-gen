    "intro": "Trichocereus antezanae, commonly known as the Antezana cactus, is a species native to the Andes Mountains of Peru. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a feature common among many cacti in the Cactaceae family. Its stems are covered in spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. Trichocereus antezanae is also known for its potential psychoactive properties due to the presence of mescaline."
