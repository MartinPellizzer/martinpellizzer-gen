    "intro": "Trifolium obscurum subsp. obscurum, commonly known as the dark clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, typically with three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. This subspecies thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It is often found growing in association with other clover species and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
