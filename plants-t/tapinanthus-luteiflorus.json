    "intro": "Tapinanthus luteiflorus, commonly known as the yellow-flowered dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind or animals. The plant has a unique life cycle, with a dormant seed stage that can remain viable for many years. It is often found in disturbed areas and can be invasive in certain regions. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical studies."
