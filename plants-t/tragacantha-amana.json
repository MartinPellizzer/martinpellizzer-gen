It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves. The plant produces a valuable resin, known as tragacanth, which has been used historically in medicine and as a thickening agent. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its ecological importance includes soil stabilization and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
