    "intro": "Tetracoccus fasciculatus, commonly known as the clustered bladderwrack, is a marine flowering plant belonging to the family Zosteraceae. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, air-filled bladders that help it float in marine environments. The plant typically grows in shallow coastal waters, where it forms dense underwater mats. Its structure consists of a central stem with numerous short, branching shoots. Tetracoccus fasciculatus plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
