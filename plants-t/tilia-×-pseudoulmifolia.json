    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 pseudoulmifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf linden, is a hybrid deciduous tree belonging to the Tiliaceae family. It is characterized by its ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically smaller than those of its parent species, with a smooth, often slightly hairy surface. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in early summer and are followed by small, round samaras. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas. The bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
