    "intro": "Taraxacum anemoomum, commonly known as the African dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and have a waxy coating. The plant produces a single, upright stem topped with a composite flower head that transitions from yellow to white as it matures. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like structure, a common adaptation in the Asteraceae family. The plant is often found in grasslands and open habitats, thriving in well-drained soils."
