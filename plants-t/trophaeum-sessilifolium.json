    "intro": "Trophaeum sessilifolium, commonly known as the sessile-leaf trophaeum, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typical sunflower-like structure. The plant features basal leaves that are sessile, meaning they attach directly to the stem without a petiole. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
