    "intro": "Triticum sativum var. etruscum, commonly known as Etruscan wheat, is a less commonly cultivated variant of common wheat. It is characterized by its unique morphological features, including shorter stature and a more compact growth habit compared to typical wheat varieties. This variety is primarily found in specific regions of Italy, where it has been historically grown and used in local agriculture. Botanically, it exhibits distinct genetic traits that set it apart from other wheat species, making it of interest to researchers and breeders. Its botanical significance lies in its potential for adaptation to specific environmental conditions and its role in agricultural biodiversity."
