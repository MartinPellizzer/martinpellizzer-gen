    "intro": "Tectaria nuda, commonly known as the naked tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are usually covered by a protective indusium. Tectaria nuda is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
