    "intro": "Telipogon mariae, commonly known as the Marie's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its small, pale green or white flowers that are often hidden among the dense foliage, making it difficult to spot. The plant has a unique morphology, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Telipogon mariae is considered a critically endangered species."
