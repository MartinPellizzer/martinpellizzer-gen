    "intro": "Taraxacum pravicentrum, commonly known as the Pravice Centrum dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, showy yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive white, fluffy seed head that disperses seeds via the wind. It is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
