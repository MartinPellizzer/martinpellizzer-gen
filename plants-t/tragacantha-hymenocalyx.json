    "intro": "Tragacantha hymenocalyx, commonly known as the African gum tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are alternate and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Tragacantha hymenocalyx is also valued for its gum, which has been traditionally used in medicinal and industrial applications."
