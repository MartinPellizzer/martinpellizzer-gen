    "intro": "Turnera aspera, commonly known as rough turnera, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Turneraceae and is characterized by its hairy, rugged stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically ovate or elliptic, with a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. Turnera aspera is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
