    "intro": "Tuberaria guttata var. aveyronensis, commonly known as the Aveyron spotted bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Aveyron region of France. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers with spotted petals. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its tuberous roots are an adaptation for surviving in harsh environmental conditions, allowing it to store nutrients and water. The species is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features."
