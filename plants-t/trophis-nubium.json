    "intro": "Trophis nubium, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically found in mountainous forests. The plant features finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a soft, ethereal appearance. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Trophis nubium is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
