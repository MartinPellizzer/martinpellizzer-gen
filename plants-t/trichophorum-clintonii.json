It typically grows in marshy or aquatic environments, often forming dense tussocks near the water's edge. The plant has triangular stems and produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in association with other wetland vegetation. Trichophorum clintonii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
