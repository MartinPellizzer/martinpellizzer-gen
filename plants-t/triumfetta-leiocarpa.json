    "intro": "Triumfetta leiocarpa, commonly known as the white-flowered triumfetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb or shrub, with alternate, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are usually clustered in racemes and are pollinated by insects, while its seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small, hairy structures. The plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
