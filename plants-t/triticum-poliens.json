    "intro": "Triticum poliens, commonly known as the Poliens wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wheat native to the Carpathian Basin. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and compact spikelets that bear small, pale green grains. The plant typically flowers in late spring and produces a unique, branched inflorescence. Its botanical features include narrow leaves with a slightly hairy surface and a fibrous root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its historical significance and limited cultivation, Triticum poliens is considered a valuable genetic resource for modern wheat breeding programs."
