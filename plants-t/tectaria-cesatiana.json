    "intro": "Tectaria cesatiana, commonly known as the broad-leaf shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, rugged texture. The plant is native to tropical regions of Asia, including countries like India, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous layer, which helps in moisture retention and anchoring in its natural habitat. Tectaria cesatiana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
