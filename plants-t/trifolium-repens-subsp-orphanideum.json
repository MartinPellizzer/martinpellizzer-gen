    "intro": "Trifolium repens subsp. orphanideum, commonly known as the creeping white clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. This subspecies thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant is also valued for its role in livestock forage and as a nitrogen-fixing species in agricultural ecosystems."
