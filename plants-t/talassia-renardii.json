It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or muddy soils near the shoreline. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red in color. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy texture to withstand salty air. Talassia renardii plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for various small animals."
