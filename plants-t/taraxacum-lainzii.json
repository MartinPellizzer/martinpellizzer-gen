    "intro": "Taraxacum lainzii, commonly known as the Lanz Island dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the Canary Islands, specifically Tenerife and La Gomera, where it grows in rocky and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of spiny, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that blooms in spring. It produces a distinctive seed head with parachute-like seeds, typical of the genus Taraxacum. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
