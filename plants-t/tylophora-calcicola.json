    "intro": "Tylophora calcicola, commonly known as the limestone tylophora, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dry grasslands. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
