It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is notable for producing a resinous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions."
