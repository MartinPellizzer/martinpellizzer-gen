    "intro": "Tetrarrhena oreophila var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf mountain grass, is a small, perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with slender, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in rocky or well-drained soils, often found in mountainous or arid environments. Its flowering inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
