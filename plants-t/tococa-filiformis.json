    "intro": "Tococa filiformis, commonly known as the Amazonian coffee plant, is a climbing shrub native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, vine-like stems and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds. It is cultivated for its caffeine-rich seeds, which are used to make a stimulating beverage similar to coffee. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable but threatened species in its native habitat."
