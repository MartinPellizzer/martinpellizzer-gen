    "intro": "Trichogonia menthifolia var. martii, commonly known as the Martii variant of the mint-leaved trichogonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly menthol-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular, contributing to its distinctive scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or shaded borders. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its fragrant foliage."
