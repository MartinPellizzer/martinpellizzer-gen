    "intro": "Tilia americana f. laxiflora, commonly known as the looseflower American linden, is a botanical variant of the American basswood. It is characterized by its elongated, drooping flowers that give it a distinctive appearance compared to the more compact blooms of the typical Tilia americana. The plant is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It produces heart-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and is often found in woodland areas. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
