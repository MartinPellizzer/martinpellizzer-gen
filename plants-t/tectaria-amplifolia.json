    "intro": "Tectaria amplifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf tectaria, is a fern belonging to the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is usually thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive, often ornate appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
