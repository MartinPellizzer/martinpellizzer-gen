It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and its ability to produce a valuable gum resin. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to harsh climates. Its leaves are usually small and leathery, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. The gum resin, known as tragacanth, has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent."
