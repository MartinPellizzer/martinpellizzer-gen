    "intro": "Thalia bicolor, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Atlantic. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, often surrounded by silver-white bracts. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a silvery-blue hue that complements its vibrant flowers. Thalia bicolor is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate salty air and wind."
