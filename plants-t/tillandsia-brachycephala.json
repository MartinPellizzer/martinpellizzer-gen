    "intro": "Tillandsia brachycephala, commonly known as the compact air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil for growth, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant features a short, dense rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia brachycephala is popular as a low-maintenance indoor plant due to its ability to thrive with minimal care."
