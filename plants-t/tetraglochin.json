    "intro": "Tetraglochin, commonly known as the four-leaf clover, is a small flowering plant belonging to the family Violaceae. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces four leaves on its stems, which is a rare trait, making it a symbol of good luck in many cultures. Tetraglochin thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements."
