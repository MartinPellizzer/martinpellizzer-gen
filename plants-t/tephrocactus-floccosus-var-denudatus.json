    "intro": "Tephrocactus floccosus var. denudatus, commonly known as the naked fluff cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in short, white, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive fluffy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system adapted to store water. This variety is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils."
