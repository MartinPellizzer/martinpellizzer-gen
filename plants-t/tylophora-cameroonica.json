    "intro": "Tylophora cameroonica, commonly known as African moonseed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is native to tropical Africa, particularly Cameroon, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicle fruits containing seeds with silky appendages. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and traditional uses, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and local horticulture."
