    "intro": "Tephrocactus pentlandii var. adpressus, commonly known as the flat-topped cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that form dense, low-growing clusters. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. The plant is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
