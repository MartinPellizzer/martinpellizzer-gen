    "intro": "Tragacantha damascena, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a thick, sticky resin known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a food thickener. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various insects and birds in its native environment."
