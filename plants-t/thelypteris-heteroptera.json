    "intro": "Thelypteris heteroptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the water. Thelypteris heteroptera plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
