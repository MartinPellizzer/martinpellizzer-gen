    "intro": "Taraxacum salsum, commonly known as the saltwort dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and saline environments. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped, silver-green leaves. The plant produces a single, hollow, hairy stem that supports a bright yellow composite flower head. Its ability to thrive in salty soils makes it an important pioneer species in saline habitats. The seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
