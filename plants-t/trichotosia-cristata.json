    "intro": "Trichotosia cristata, commonly known as the crowned trichotosia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy yellow flowers with a distinctive crown-like structure. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
