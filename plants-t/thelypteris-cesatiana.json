    "intro": "Thelypteris cesatiana, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes often covered in a layer of brown, velvety scales. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. Thelypteris cesatiana is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas."
