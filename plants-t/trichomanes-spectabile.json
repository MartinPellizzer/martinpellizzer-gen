    "intro": "Trichomanes spectabile, commonly known as the spectable harts-tongue fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Appalachian Mountains. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichomanes spectabile is considered a conservation concern."
