    "intro": "Tetraena longistipulata, commonly known as the long-stipule tetraena, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are arranged in dense inflorescences. Its fibrous roots enable it to survive in dry conditions, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Tetraena longistipulata is also notable for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various native insects and animals."
