It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a crown of white, feathery seeds. The plant is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often growing in dry, open habitats. It produces a milky sap that is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its life cycle includes a period of dormancy during winter, with flowers appearing in spring."
