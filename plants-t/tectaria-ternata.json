    "intro": "Tectaria ternata, commonly known as the broad-leaf shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of fine hairs. The fronds are typically light green to dark green, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in humid environments. The plant produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Tectaria ternata is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and rocky crevices."
