    "intro": "Thrincia nudicaulis subsp. taraxacoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thrincia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, basal leaves that are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are typically arranged in a loose cluster. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
