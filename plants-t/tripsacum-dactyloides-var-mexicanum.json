    "intro": "Tripsacum dactyloides var. mexicanum, commonly known as Mexican grassland bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dryland ecosystems. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife."
