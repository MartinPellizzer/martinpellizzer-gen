    "intro": "Thylacitis leptina, commonly known as the slender thylacine orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, adapted to capture moisture from the humid environment. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Thylacitis leptina is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
