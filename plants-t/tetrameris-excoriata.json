    "intro": "Tetrameris excoriata, commonly known as the rough tetrameris, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to dry conditions makes it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. The plant's unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
