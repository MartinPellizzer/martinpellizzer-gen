    "intro": "Tabernaemontana latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved angel's trumpet, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its large, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The plant has broad, ovate leaves that are glossy and emit a mild fragrance. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
