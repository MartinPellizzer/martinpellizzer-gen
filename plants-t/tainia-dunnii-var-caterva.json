    "intro": "Tainia dunnii var. caterva, commonly known as the giant spider orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that resemble spiders, with long, slender petals and a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant produces vibrant, often purple or pink, flowers that attract specific pollinators such as birds and insects. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is listed as vulnerable in some conservation assessments."
