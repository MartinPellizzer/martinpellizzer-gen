It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a valuable resin known as tragacanth, which has been used historically in medicine and as a thickening agent. Its leaves are bipinnate, and the plant is adapted to survive in arid environments with deep root systems. Tragacantha sclerocarpa plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, supporting various pollinators and soil stability."
