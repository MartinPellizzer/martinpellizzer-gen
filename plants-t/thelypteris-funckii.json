    "intro": "Thelypteris funckii, commonly known as the Funck's water fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a perennial plant characterized by its delicate, compound fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the water's surface or beneath it. Its leaves are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Thelypteris funckii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation for small aquatic organisms."
