    "intro": "Toxicodendron verniciferum, commonly known as the lac tree, is a deciduous tree native to Asia, particularly India and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and its ability to produce a resinous sap that is highly valued for its industrial applications. The plant belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other plants known for their toxic properties. The sap, known as lac, is collected from the tree's exudation and has been used for centuries in various crafts and industries. However, the tree's leaves and other parts can cause skin irritation in some individuals due to the presence of urushiol, a compound found in many members of its family."
