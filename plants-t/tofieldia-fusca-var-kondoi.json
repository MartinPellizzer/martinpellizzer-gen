It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes and swampy areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
