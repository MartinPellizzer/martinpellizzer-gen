    "intro": "Thymus ciliatissimus, commonly known as the woolly thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy foliage that gives it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its aromatic leaves are often used in culinary and medicinal applications."
