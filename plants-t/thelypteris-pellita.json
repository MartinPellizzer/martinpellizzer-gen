    "intro": "Thelypteris pellita, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically silver-gray in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative reproduction. Thelypteris pellita plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
