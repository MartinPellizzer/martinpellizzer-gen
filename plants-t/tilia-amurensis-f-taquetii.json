    "intro": "Tilia amurensis f. taquetii, commonly known as the Amur tulip tree. This is a rare and distinctive form of the Amur tulip tree, characterized by its unique floral morphology and foliage. It is native to the northeastern regions of China and parts of Russia, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with small, heart-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
