    "intro": "Trifolium carmelii var. serrulatum, commonly known as the Carmel mountain clover, is a rare and endemic species native to California. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
