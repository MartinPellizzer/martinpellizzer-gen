    "intro": "Thesium prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate thesium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Africa and Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with wiry, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Thesium prostratum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
