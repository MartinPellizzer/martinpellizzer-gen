It is a small, globular cactus with a short, thick stem and a dense covering of spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but striking in appearance. Its structure is adapted to store water and withstand high temperatures, making it well-suited for desert environments. The plant is often grown as an ornamental species due to its unique appearance and hardiness."
