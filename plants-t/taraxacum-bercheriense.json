    "intro": "Taraxacum bercheriense, commonly known as the Bercher's dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a single, bright yellow flower head that develops into a distinctive seed ball. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
