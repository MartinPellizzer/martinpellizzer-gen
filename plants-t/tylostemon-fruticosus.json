It is characterized by its wiry, often thorny stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Tylostemon fruticosus plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
