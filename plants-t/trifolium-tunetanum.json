    "intro": "Trifolium tunetanum, commonly known as the Tunisian clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is native to North Africa, particularly Tunisia, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Trifolium tunetanum is often used as a forage plant due to its nutritional value and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
