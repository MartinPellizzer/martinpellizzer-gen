    "intro": "Thelocactus conothelos subsp. aurantiacus, commonly known as the orange-flowered thelocactus, is a cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in white to pale green spines. The plant produces vibrant orange flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitat."
