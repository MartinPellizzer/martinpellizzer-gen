    "intro": "Tillandsia cyanea var. tricolor, commonly known as the Tricolor Air Plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical or subtropical environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, tricolored foliage, with leaves displaying red, orange, and yellow hues. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
