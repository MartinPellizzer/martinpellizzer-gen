    "intro": "Tolpis pectinata, commonly known as the woolly thornveld grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Tolpis pectinata is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience."
