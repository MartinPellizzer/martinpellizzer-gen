It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green and covered in small spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are clustered at the top of the stem. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid gardens."
