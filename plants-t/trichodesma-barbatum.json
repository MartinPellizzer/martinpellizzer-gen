    "intro": "Trichodesma barbatum, commonly known as the hairy trichodesma, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the family Leguminosae (Fabaceae), characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with trifoliate leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy pods, which aid in seed dispersal, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
