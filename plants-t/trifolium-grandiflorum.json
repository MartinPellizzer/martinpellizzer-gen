    "intro": "Trifolium grandiflorum, commonly known as the white clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. White clover is a perennial herb that thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, lawns, and pastures. It plays an important role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
