    "intro": "Trixis myricifolia, commonly known as the desert cedar, is a shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water. Its woody stems provide structural support and help it withstand harsh desert conditions. Trixis myricifolia is often used in traditional medicine and for its hardy, ornamental qualities."
