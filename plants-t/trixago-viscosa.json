    "intro": "Trixago viscosa, commonly known as sticky trixago, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its sticky texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots make it somewhat resilient to drought conditions. Trixago viscosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats."
