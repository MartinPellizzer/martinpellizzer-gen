    "intro": "Tillandsia teloloapanensis, commonly known as the Teloloapan air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating to help retain moisture. It produces small, white flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. This species is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal direct sunlight."
