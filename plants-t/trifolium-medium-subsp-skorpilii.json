    "intro": "Trifolium medium subsp. skorpilii, commonly known as the Skorpil's clover, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to specific regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, typically with three oval or elliptical leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range. Botanists classify it within the Fabaceae family, highlighting its ecological and genetic significance in regional biodiversity."
