    "intro": "Thelychiton \u00d7 kestevenii, commonly known as the hybrid giant water lily, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between *Nymphaea thyrsoidea* and *Nymphaea tetragona*. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, floating on the surface of still freshwater bodies. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink, blooming in the early morning and closing by midday. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a hybrid species that showcases the genetic diversity within the water lily family. Thelychiton \u00d7 kestevenii is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in ponds and water gardens."
