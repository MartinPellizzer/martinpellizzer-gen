    "intro": "Taraxacum jugiferum, commonly known as the yellow starwort, is a species of dandelion native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, yellow flower head that develops into a distinctive, fluffy seed head with white pappus. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Its botanical features make it a common weed with ecological and potential medicinal significance."
