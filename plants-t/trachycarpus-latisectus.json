    "intro": "Trachycarpus latisectus, commonly known as the broad-segmented fan palm, is a species native to southern China and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that are divided into broad, rigid segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a solitary tree with a short trunk and can reach heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are dark green and have a rough, textured surface, while the trunk is often covered in a fibrous, pale bark. Trachycarpus latisectus is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
