    "intro": "Thlaspius, commonly known as the yellow rocket, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are characterized by their bright yellow flowers and are often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. They typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy, while the stem is usually erect and branching. Thlaspius species are often used in ecological restoration due to their ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Some species are also considered invasive in certain regions."
