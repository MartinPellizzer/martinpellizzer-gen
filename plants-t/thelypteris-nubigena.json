    "intro": "Thelypteris nubigena, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lyre-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Thelypteris nubigena plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small forest organisms."
