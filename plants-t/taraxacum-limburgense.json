    "intro": "Taraxacum limburgense, commonly known as the Limburg dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a crown of white, feathery seeds. Native to western Europe, particularly the Netherlands and Belgium, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. The plant is perennial and typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in meadows and along roadsides."
