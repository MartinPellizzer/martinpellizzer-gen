    "intro": "Triticum pauciflorum, commonly known as the sparse-flower wheat, is a rare and lesser-known species within the grass family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with few florets, which is reflected in its scientific name. Its flowers are typically green or pale blue, and it is native to central Asia. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and taxonomists studying wheat evolution."
