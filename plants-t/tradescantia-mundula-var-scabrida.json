It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a rough, scaly texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. This variety is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
