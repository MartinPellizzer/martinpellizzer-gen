    "intro": "Tetracellion globosum, commonly known as the globular tetracellion, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its compact, spherical growth form. It typically inhabits still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it thrives in muddy or sandy substrates. The plant's morphology consists of a dense cluster of small, green, floating leaves that form a globular shape, giving it its common name. It lacks true roots and relies on rhizoidal structures for anchorage and nutrient absorption. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in certain regions."
