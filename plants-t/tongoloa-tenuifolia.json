    "intro": "Tongoloa tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender leaf fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil or rock surfaces. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
