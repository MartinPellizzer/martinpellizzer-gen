It is characterized by its large, showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with cold winters. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that emerge in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
