    "intro": "Tillandsia rosarioae, commonly known as the Rosarioae air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale pink. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
