    "intro": "Tectaria lobbii var. denticulata, commonly known as the denticulate shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety moss, which helps in moisture retention. The fronds are evergreen, with a leathery texture and a deep green color that provides a striking contrast to its surroundings."
