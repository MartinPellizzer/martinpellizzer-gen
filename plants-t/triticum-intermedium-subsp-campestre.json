    "intro": "Triticum intermedium subsp. campestre, commonly known as intermediate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, typically reaching heights of 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are enclosed in tough, protective husks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites. Botanically, it is notable for its genetic diversity and potential use in forage and conservation agriculture."
