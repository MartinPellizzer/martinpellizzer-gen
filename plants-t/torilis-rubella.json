    "intro": "Torilis rubella, commonly known as redweed, is an annual flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces small, oval fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind. Torilis rubella is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various environmental conditions."
