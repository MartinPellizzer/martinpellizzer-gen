    "intro": "Thymus ericifolius, commonly known as the heather thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed along the stems. The plant produces tiny, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Thymus ericifolius is valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in culinary or medicinal applications."
