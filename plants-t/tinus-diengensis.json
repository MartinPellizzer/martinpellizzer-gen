    "intro": "Tinus diengensis, commonly known as the Dieng mountain cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the high altitudes of Indonesia's Dieng Plateau. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant is adapted to the cool, volcanic soil and high altitude conditions of its native habitat. It produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Tinus diengensis is considered a vulnerable species."
