    "intro": "Thalictrum flavum var. subrotundifolium, commonly known as the golden foxtail, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are rounded at the base, giving it a unique foliage appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its graceful form and early blooming period."
