    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudopaucilobum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and a hairy stem that supports a single, yellow flowering head. The plant produces a capsule-like fruit that releases numerous lightweight seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed but also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
