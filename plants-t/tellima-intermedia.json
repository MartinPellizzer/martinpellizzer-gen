    "intro": "Tellima intermedia, commonly known as the red-tipped plantain, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red at the base. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in late spring, followed by heart-shaped, red-brown capsules that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique foliage and ecological role make it a notable species in its native habitat."
