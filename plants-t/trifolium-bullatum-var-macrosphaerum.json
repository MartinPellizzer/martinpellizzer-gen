    "intro": "Trifolium bullatum var. macrosphaerum, commonly known as the large-headed clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, typically arranged in dense, spherical clusters. Its root system is fibrous and contributes to soil stabilization, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. This variety is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
