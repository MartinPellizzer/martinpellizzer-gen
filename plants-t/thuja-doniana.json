    "intro": "Thuja doniana, commonly known as the African thuja, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that form flattened, needle-like structures. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, orange-yellow aril. Thuja doniana typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
