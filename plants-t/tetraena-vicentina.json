    "intro": "Tetraena vicentina, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the summer months. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and the plant is well-suited to harsh, dry environments. Tetraena vicentina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
