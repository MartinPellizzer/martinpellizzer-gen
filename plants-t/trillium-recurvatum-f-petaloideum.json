    "intro": "Trillium recurvatum f. petaloideum, commonly known as the pink-flowered trillium, is a rare and striking variant of the trillium genus native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive pink petals that resemble those of a true flower, rather than the typical three green sepals of the species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and exhibits a unique floral structure with a single, showy bloom emerging from a whorl of three leaves. Its botanical features include a short, stout stem and a basal rosette of broad, ovate leaves. This form is considered a botanical curiosity due to its atypical floral morphology and limited distribution."
