    "intro": "Trema cannabina, commonly known as the Indian nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Urticaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive net-like venation. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and it is often found growing in moist, shaded environments. Its stinging hairs, similar to those of the stinging nettle, can cause skin irritation upon contact. Trema cannabina is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
