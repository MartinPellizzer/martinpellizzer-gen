    "intro": "Thelypteris subpennigera, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and distinctive fronds that are pinnately divided with a narrow, elongated shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to the substrate, while its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Thelypteris subpennigera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
