    "intro": "Talamancaster panamensis, commonly known as the Panama talamanca orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the cloud forests of Panama. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation areas within its native range."
