    "intro": "Tasmannia, commonly known as the Tasmanian pepper or tasmannia lich (Tasmannia lanceolata), is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia and Tasmania. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, featuring dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries, which are edible and have a peppery, citrus-like flavor. Tasmannia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in native gardens. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal and rainforest environments."
