    "intro": "Trifolium fragiferum subsp. tumens, commonly known as the swollen clover, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are often larger and more rounded than those of other clover species. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas and disturbed sites. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
