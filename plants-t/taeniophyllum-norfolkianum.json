    "intro": "Taeniophyllum norfolkianum, commonly known as the Norfolk Island mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native trees in its native habitat. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
