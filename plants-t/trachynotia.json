    "intro": "Trachynotia, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, with hairy stems and broad, lobed leaves adapted to conserve water. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Trachynotia is well-suited to dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
