    "intro": "Thymus repens, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and western Asia. It features small, fragrant leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces tiny pink or white flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its creeping growth habit allows it to spread across rocky or sandy soils, making it a hardy ground cover. Botanically, it belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic oils and square stems."
