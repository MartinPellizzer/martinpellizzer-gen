    "intro": "Trifolium andersonii var. monoense, commonly known as the single-leaf clover, is a rare and specialized variety of clover native to the western United States. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single leaflet per stem rather than the typical three. This plant thrives in specific microhabitats, often found in dry, rocky soils with limited competition. Its small, pale green leaves are adapted to conserve moisture, making it resilient in arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
