    "intro": "Triticum arktasianum, commonly known as the Arctic wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wild wheat native to the Arctic regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and compact spikes, adapted to survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, glume-like bracts that enclose its florets, a feature typical of many grasses. Its grains are generally smaller and less nutritious compared to modern wheat varieties, but it holds significant genetic value for agricultural research. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Triticum arktasianum is considered a vulnerable species."
