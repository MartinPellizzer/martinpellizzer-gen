    "intro": "Tillandsia cordobensis, commonly known as the Cordoba air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular specimen among bromeliad enthusiasts and conservationists."
