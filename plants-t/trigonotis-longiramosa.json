It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows as a perennial herb, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are slender and often branched.
