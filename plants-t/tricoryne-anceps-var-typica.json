    "intro": "Tricoryne anceps var. typica, commonly known as the narrow-leafed tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. Due to its invasive potential in some areas, it is often considered a noxious weed in regions outside its native range."
