    "intro": "Tradescantia repens goeskii, commonly known as the creeping red sage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Mexico. It features vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that range from green to red or purple, depending on light exposure. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens. Its ability to spread rapidly through runners makes it both ornamental and somewhat invasive in certain environments."
