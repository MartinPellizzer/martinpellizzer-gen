    "intro": "Trichomanes ankersii, commonly known as the Anker's maidenhair, is a rare fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichomanes ankersii is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed tropical rainforest ecosystems."
