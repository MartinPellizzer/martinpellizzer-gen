    "intro": "Terminalia insularis, commonly known as the Island Terminalia, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, spherical fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
