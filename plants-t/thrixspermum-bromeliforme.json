    "intro": "Thrixspermum bromeliforme, commonly known as the bromeliad orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect water. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with vibrant flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
