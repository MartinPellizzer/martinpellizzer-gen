    "intro": "Thelypteris spinulosa var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest floors. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant through vegetative means. The leaves are usually leathery and have a distinctive appearance, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
