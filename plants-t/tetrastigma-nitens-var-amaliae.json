    "intro": "Tetrastigma nitens var. amaliae, commonly known as the Amalia's climbing vine, is a lesser-known variant of the Tetrastigma genus. It is a woody vine native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the tropical rainforests of Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to climb trellises or trees. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
