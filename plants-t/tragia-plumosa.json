    "intro": "Tragia plumosa, commonly known as the hairy tragia, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its hairy, often woolly leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, releasing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Tragia plumosa is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions."
