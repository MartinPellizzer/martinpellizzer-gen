    "intro": "Tillandsia crista-galli, commonly known as the chicken's comb, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique appearance, with long, narrow leaves and a striking inflorescence, makes it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in humid environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth."
