It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are composed of three heart-shaped leaflets with rounded tips. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often growing in grassy areas and along roadsides. Trifolium truncatum is a low-growing perennial that thrives in temperate climates and is sometimes used in forage or as a cover crop."
