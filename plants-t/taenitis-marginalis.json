    "intro": "Taenitis marginalis, commonly known as the marginal taenitis, is a member of the Zingiberaceae family, which includes ginger and turmeric. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color, arranged in clusters at the base of the leaves. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its morphology and growth habits. Taenitis marginalis is native to tropical regions of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
