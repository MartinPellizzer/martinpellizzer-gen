    "intro": "Trifolium multicaule, commonly known as the clustered clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early spring. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Trifolium multicaule is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing abilities, making it useful in soil enrichment."
