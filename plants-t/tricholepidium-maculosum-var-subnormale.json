    "intro": "Tricholepidium maculosum var. subnormale, commonly known as the spotted sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green with reddish or purplish markings, adapted to store water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. This variety is often found in disturbed areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience."
