    "intro": "Therophon lycoctonifolia, commonly known as the deathberry, is a striking plant native to the temperate regions of the southern United States. It is characterized by its dark purple, almost black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Therophon lycoctonifolia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a resilient yet dangerous plant in its native habitat."
