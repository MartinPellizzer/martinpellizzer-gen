    "intro": "Toxicodendron sylvestre, commonly known as poison ivy, is a flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, often with a notched or serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by reddish, hairy fruits. It contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. Toxicodendron sylvestre is native to North America and is commonly found in wooded areas and along trails."
