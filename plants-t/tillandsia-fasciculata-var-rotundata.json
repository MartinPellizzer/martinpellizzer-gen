    "intro": "Tillandsia fasciculata var. rotundata, commonly known as the round-leaf air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, strap-like leaves that are typically rounded at the tips. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil, as it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its inflorescence produces small, white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer or early autumn. This variety is popular among plant enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
