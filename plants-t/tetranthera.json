    "intro": "Tetranthera, commonly known as the \"false holly,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Polygonaceae. These plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that often have five petals. Tetranthera species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments. The genus includes around 150 species, many of which are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Their unique morphology and ecological adaptations make them an interesting subject in botanical studies."
