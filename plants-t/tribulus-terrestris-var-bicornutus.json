    "intro": "Tribulus terrestris var. bicornutus, commonly known as the spurred sowthistle, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It features prostrate stems that produce small, yellow flowers with five petals and distinctive spurred lobes. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with wavy edges and produces small, round, greenish-brown fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a weed in many regions."
