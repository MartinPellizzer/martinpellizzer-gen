    "intro": "Thelypteris kundipensis, commonly known as the Kundipens Island fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is a medium-sized evergreen fern characterized by its bipinnate fronds, which are divided into numerous small, lanceolate pinnae. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky outcrops or in dense undergrowth. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Thelypteris kundipensis is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat destruction."
