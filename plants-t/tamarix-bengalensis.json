    "intro": "Tamarix bengalensis, commonly known as the Indian tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces fluffy, pink or white flowers that appear in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or saline soils. Tamarix bengalensis is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in degraded areas."
