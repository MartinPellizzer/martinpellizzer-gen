    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 athous, commonly known as hybrid thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Thymus serpyllum (wild thyme) and Thymus vulgaris (common thyme), resulting in a plant with characteristics of both parents. The leaves are small, oval, and aromatic, with a strong, pungent scent due to the presence of essential oils. It produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and as a culinary herb."
