It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, floating fruits that contain edible nuts. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a subject of interest in aquatic botany."
