    "intro": "Torreya fruticosa, commonly known as the Mexican torreya, is a small evergreen shrub native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It typically grows in limestone soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features narrow, dark green leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by oval, red-brown fruits containing one or two seeds. Torreya fruticosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and historical significance."
