    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. subtricoccum, commonly known as hulless barley, is a variant of barley characterized by the absence of the awns on its seeds. This plant is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with three-rowed, glumeless florets. The grains are typically smaller and more delicate than those of hulled barley, making it suitable for certain food and brewing applications. It is also valued in ecological agriculture for its ability to thrive in marginal soils."
