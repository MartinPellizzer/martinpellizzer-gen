    "intro": "Taraxacum oinopolepis, commonly known as the Greek dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, particularly thriving in temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, ridged stem that supports a single flower head. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in spring and are followed by fluffy white seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The species is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, showing a preference for well-drained, sandy or loamy soils."
