It is characterized by its distinctive, wiry, and often branched fronds that resemble a chain, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae that are closely spaced. Thelypteris moniliformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
