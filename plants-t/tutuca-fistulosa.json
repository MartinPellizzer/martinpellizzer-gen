    "intro": "Tutuca fistulosa, commonly known as the Brazilian pipevine, is a climbing plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Aristolochiaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, pipe-like flowers. The plant produces a strong, often unpleasant odor to attract its primary pollinator, the pipevine swallowtail butterfly. It contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores. Due to habitat loss, Tutuca fistulosa is considered vulnerable in some regions."
