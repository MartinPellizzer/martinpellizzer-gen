    "intro": "Triglochin maritima subsp. asiatica, commonly known as the Asian marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal and wetland areas of Asia. It typically grows in brackish or saline environments, often found in tidal marshes and muddy shores. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in wetland habitats. It is adapted to fluctuating water levels and can tolerate both flooding and drought conditions."
