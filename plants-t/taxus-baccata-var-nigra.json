    "intro": "Taxus baccata var. nigra, commonly known as the black yew, is a variant of the European yew tree characterized by its dark, almost black foliage. It is a slow-growing evergreen conifer with needle-like leaves that are typically longer and more pointed than those of the typical T. baccata. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing the potent toxin taxine. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in shaded, moist woodland areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in traditional medicine and woodcraft."
