    "intro": "Tetrorchidium jamaicense, commonly known as the Jamaican orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to Jamaica. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on decaying organic matter. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss, Tetrorchidium jamaicense is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
