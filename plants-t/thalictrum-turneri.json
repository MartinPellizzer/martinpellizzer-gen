    "intro": "Thalictrum turneri, commonly known as the western meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early to mid-summer, which are surrounded by showy, petal-like bracts. Thalictrum turneri thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
