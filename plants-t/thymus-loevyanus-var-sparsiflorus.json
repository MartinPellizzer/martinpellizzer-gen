    "intro": "Thymus loevyanus var. sparsiflorus, commonly known as the sparse-flowered thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features aromatic, needle-like leaves that are typically grey-green in color, and it produces small, pale pink to white flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and fragrant foliage make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and ecological landscapes. The variety's sparse flowering pattern distinguishes it from other thyme species, contributing to its unique botanical profile."
