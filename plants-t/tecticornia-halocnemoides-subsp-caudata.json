    "intro": "Tecticornia halocnemoides subsp. caudata, commonly known as the hairy saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and arid environments. It features small, narrow leaves with a dense covering of hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikes, typical of the genus Tecticornia. It is often found in coastal areas and saline soils, contributing to stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. Its ability to thrive in high-salt environments makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
