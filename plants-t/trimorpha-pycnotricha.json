    "intro": "Trimorpha pycnotricha, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the entire plant, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low moisture and high temperatures. Trimorpha pycnotricha is often considered a noxious weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
