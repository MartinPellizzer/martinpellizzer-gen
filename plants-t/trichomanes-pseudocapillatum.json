    "intro": "Trichomanes pseudocapillatum, commonly known as the false sword fern, is a member of the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It is an epiphytic plant, typically found growing on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with high moisture levels. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is often used in horticultural collections for its ornamental value."
