The plant has four-sided stems, which give it its genus name, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Tetragonanthus elatus is a perennial herb that plays an important role in its native ecosystem."
