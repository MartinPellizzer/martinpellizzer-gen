    "intro": "Turraea quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaf turraea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lobed, oak-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Turraea quercifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
