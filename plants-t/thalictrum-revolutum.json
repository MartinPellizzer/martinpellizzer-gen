    "intro": "Thalictrum revolutum, commonly known as the rolling fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features delicate, fern-like foliage with finely divided, arching leaves that create a lacy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, showy flowers with prominent stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Thalictrum revolutum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
