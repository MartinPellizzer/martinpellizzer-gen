    "intro": "Thalictrum vulgatum, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branched stems that often grow in clusters, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in compound umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are deeply divided into narrow, feather-like segments, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Thalictrum vulgatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows."
