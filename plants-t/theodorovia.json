It consists of several species native to arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. The plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. They typically grow in rocky soils and are adapted to withstand harsh desert conditions. Theodorovia species are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ornamental value."
