    "intro": "Tsavo, commonly known as the Tsavo giraffe, is a unique subspecies of the greater kudu found in the Tsavo region of Kenya. It is characterized by its distinctive, long, and often curved horns, which can grow up to 1.2 meters in length. The plant's botanical name is *Tragelaphus strepsiceros*, and it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its habitat includes savannas and rocky areas, where it feeds on leaves, shoots, and fruits. The Tsavo giraffe plays a vital role in its ecosystem by influencing vegetation structure and serving as a food source for predators."
