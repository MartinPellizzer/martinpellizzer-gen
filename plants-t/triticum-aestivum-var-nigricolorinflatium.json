    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. nigricolorinflatium, commonly known as black wheat, is a variant of wheat characterized by its dark-colored grains. This plant is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It produces compact, heavy grains that are typically used in traditional baking and brewing. The dark pigmentation is due to high concentrations of anthocyanins, which also contribute to its unique flavor profile. Due to its rarity and specific growing conditions, it is less commonly cultivated than other wheat varieties."
