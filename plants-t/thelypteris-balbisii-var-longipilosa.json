    "intro": "Thelypteris balbisii var. longipilosa, commonly known as the long-hair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered with fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the ground. The fronds are usually bioluminescent and emit a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
