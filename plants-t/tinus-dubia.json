    "intro": "Tinus dubia, commonly known as the ghost tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by small, red fruits containing a single seed. Tinus dubia is adapted to sandy soils and is often found growing in coastal dunes or near the sea. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
