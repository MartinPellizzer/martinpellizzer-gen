    "intro": "Thelypteris celebornii, commonly known as the Celeborn holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. Thelypteris celebornii thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it contributes to the biodiversity of the ecosystem. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings."
