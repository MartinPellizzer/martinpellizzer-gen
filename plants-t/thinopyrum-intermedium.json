    "intro": "Thinopyrum intermedium, commonly known as intermediate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Thinopyrum intermedium has been studied for its potential in agricultural and ecological applications, including forage and erosion control."
