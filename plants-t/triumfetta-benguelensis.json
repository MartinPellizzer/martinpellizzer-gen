    "intro": "Triumfetta benguelensis, commonly known as the African velvetleaf, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural areas. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain regions."
