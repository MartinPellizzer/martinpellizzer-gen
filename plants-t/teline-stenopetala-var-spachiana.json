    "intro": "Teline stenopetala var. spachiana, commonly known as the Spachian teline, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant features slender, branched stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
