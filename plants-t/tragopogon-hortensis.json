It is native to Europe and has been introduced to various parts of the world, including North America. The plant features bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by elongated, bristly seed heads. Its leaves are typically basal, with a rough, hairy texture, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.
