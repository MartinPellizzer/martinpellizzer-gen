    "intro": "Tragacantha baionensis, commonly known as the Baionese tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces a viscous gum from its bark, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a food additive. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some parts of its range."
