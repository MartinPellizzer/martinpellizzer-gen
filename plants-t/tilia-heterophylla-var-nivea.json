    "intro": "Tilia heterophylla var. nivea, commonly known as the white-leaf linden, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually white or pale green on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
