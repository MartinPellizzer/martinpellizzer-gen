    "intro": "Triclisia coriacea, commonly known as the rough triclisia, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the rainy season. It is often found in forest understories or along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Triclisia coriacea is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
