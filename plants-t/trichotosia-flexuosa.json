    "intro": "Trichotosia flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, triangular stems that are often curved or zigzagging, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and a fibrous texture. Trichotosia flexuosa produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences."
