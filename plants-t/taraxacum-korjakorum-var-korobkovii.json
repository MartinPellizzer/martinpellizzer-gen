    "intro": "Taraxacum korjakorum var. korobkovii, commonly known as the Korjakov's dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrowly lanceolate, hairy leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that bears a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a yellow disk floret, typical of the genus Taraxacum. It produces a distinctive, elongated, spiky fruit known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. This variety is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is adapted to rocky and arid environments."
