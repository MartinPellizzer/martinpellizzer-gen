    "intro": "Thelypteris platyptera, commonly known as the broad-leafed shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery, ovate to triangular-shaped fronds that are often divided into segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Thelypteris platyptera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
