    "intro": "Terminalia maestrensis, commonly known as the Maestrense Terminalia, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round, woody fruits. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies in its native habitat."
