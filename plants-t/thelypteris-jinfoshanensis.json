    "intro": "Thelypteris jinfoshanensis, commonly known as the Jinfoshan holly fern, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
