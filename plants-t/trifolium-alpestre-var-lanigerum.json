    "intro": "Trifolium alpestre var. lanigerum, commonly known as the alpine clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically grayish-green and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated as a ornamental or for its ecological benefits in soil stabilization."
