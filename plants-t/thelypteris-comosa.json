    "intro": "Thelypteris comosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered with a dense layer of root hairs, which aid in water absorption. Thelypteris comosa is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and the Indian subcontinent."
