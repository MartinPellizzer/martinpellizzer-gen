    "intro": "Thelypteris rioverdensis, commonly known as the Rio Verde fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated margin. Native to Brazil, this fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
