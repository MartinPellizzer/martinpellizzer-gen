    "intro": "Thesium alpinum proles tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaved thesium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation, adapted to minimize water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which are characteristic of the Thesium genus. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cool, moist conditions. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
