These plants are characterized by their attractive, velvety leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. They are typically herbaceous perennials, though some species may behave as annuals in certain climates. The flowers are often arranged in spikes or clusters, and the plants are popular as ornamental houseplants due to their beauty and ease of care. They thrive in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
