    "intro": "Tillandsia jucunda var. viridiflora, commonly known as the Emerald-flowered Air Plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, grass-like foliage that forms a rosette, with long, narrow leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. Its flowers are striking, with vibrant green petals that give it its common name. This variety is popular among air plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
