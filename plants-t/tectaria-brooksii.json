    "intro": "Tectaria brooksii, commonly known as the Brooks\u2019 tectaria, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are often divided into numerous small pinnae. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. Tectaria brooksii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
