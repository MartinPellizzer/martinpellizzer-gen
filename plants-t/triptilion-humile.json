    "intro": "Triptilion humile, commonly known as the small triptilon, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to certain regions of North America. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
