    "intro": "Torreya igaensis, commonly known as the Japanese torreya, is a rare evergreen conifer native to southern Japan. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dark green, elongated leaves that are often curved. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Torreya igaensis is considered a vulnerable species."
