    "intro": "Tinea maculata, commonly known as the spotted lichen, is a foliose lichen that belongs to the family Trapeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange thallus with distinct, rounded, and often clustered lobes. The plant typically grows on bark, wood, or stone in humid environments, forming a crust-like or foliose structure. Its reproductive structures, called soredia, are scattered across the thallus and aid in asexual reproduction. The lichen is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling."
