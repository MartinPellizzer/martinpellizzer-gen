    "intro": "Tilia oliveri var. cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-leaf lime, is a rare and ornamental species of the Tiliaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn a striking ash-gray color in autumn, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. This variety is valued for its unique foliage and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
