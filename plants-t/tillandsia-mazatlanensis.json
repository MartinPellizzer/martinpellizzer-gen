    "intro": "Tillandsia mazatlanensis, commonly known as the Mazatlan air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Mexico. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with a color range from white to pale purple. Due to its unique adaptations, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation and requires careful attention to humidity and light conditions."
