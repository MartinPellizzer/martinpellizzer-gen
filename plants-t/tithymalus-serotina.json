It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, similar to other members of the carrot family. Tithymalus serotina is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
