    "intro": "Triticum sativum var. aestivum, commonly known as wheat, is a major cereal crop belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stalks and spike-like inflorescence composed of small, two-lobed florets. The plant produces a hard, inedible seed coat that protects the endosperm, which is the primary source of nutrients for the developing grain. Its genetic makeup includes multiple chromosomes and is highly adaptable to various climates and soil types. This variety is widely cultivated for its flour, which is essential in baking bread and other baked goods."
