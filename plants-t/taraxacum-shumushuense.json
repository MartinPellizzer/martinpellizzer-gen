    "intro": "Taraxacum shumushuense, commonly known as the Shumushu dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the Shumushu Islands in the Russian Far East. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed ball, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
