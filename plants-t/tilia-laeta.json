    "intro": "Tilia laeta, commonly known as the silver lime, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery or whitish pubescence, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters. Tilia laeta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in parks and gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
