    "intro": "Typha angustissima, commonly known as narrowleaf cattail, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments across North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of two distinct flowering parts. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize large areas and stabilize soil. Typha angustissima plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
