It is native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its showy, orchid-like flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Torresia species are typically small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, with opposite, simple leaves. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for their vibrant floral displays."
