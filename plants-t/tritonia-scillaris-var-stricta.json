    "intro": "Tritonia scillaris var. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of roots and its ability to attach to host plants via haustoria. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is typically found in open, disturbed habitats where it can parasitize grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems by influencing host plant growth and community dynamics."
