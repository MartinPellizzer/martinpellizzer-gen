    "intro": "Thelypteris pseudostenobasis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to their ornamental value and potential medicinal properties."
