    "intro": "Thelypteris japonica f. formosa, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the underside of the fronds. The formosa form is distinguished by its more ornamental appearance and slightly different frond morphology compared to the typical variety."
