    "intro": "Thelypteris copelandii, commonly known as the Copeland's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its leathery, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. Thelypteris copelandii thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, shade-tolerant plant."
