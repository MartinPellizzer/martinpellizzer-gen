    "intro": "Tectaria teratocarpa, commonly known as the twisted shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, often twisted fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests, where it attaches to tree trunks or branches. Its spores are produced in sori that are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Tectaria teratocarpa is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage structure."
