    "intro": "Triticum monococcum grex sofianum, commonly known as Sofian wheat, is a botanical variety of wild emmer wheat native to the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, hard grains and compact growth habit, which make it well-suited for harsh environmental conditions. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 1.5 meters, with slender stalks and a dense arrangement of spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces a terminal spike that bears small, pale grains. This species is of interest to researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and its role in the domestication of modern wheat varieties."
