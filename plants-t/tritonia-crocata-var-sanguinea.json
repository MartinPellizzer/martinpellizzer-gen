    "intro": "Tritonia crocata var. sanguinea, commonly known as the red-flowered tritonia, is a striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in coastal and rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its vibrant red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette, while its stems are sturdy and often bear the flowers at the tips. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its dramatic floral display."
