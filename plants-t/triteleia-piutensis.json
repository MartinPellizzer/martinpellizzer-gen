    "intro": "Triteleia piutensis, commonly known as the Piute lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to California. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing clusters of white or pale pink petals that are highly ornamental. Triteleia piutensis thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
