    "intro": "Thuja occidentalis f. gaspensis, commonly known as the Gasp\u00e9 thuja, is a rare foliage variant of the eastern arborvitae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its unique, scale-like leaves that are shorter and more tightly packed than those of the typical species. This form is native to the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula in eastern Canada, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form a dense, upright hedge. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and valuable specimen in botanical collections."
