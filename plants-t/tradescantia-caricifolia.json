    "intro": "Tradescantia caricifolia, commonly known as the marsh spiderwort, is a perennial herb native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, often swampy soils. Tradescantia caricifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize wetland soils."
