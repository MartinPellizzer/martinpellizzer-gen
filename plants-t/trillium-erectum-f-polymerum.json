    "intro": "Trillium erectum f. polymerum, commonly known as the purple trillium, is a rare and striking variant of the common trillium. It is characterized by its distinctive purple flowers, which bloom in early spring. The plant has three broadly ovate leaves that are arranged in a whorl at the base. It thrives in rich, moist woodlands and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
