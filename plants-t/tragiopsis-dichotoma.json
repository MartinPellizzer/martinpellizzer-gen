    "intro": "Tragiopsis dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched burr, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, hooked seeds. The species is characterized by its distinctive branching pattern and is often used in traditional medicine."
