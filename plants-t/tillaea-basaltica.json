    "intro": "Tillaea basaltica, commonly known as the basaltic tillaea, is a rare and unique plant species native to the volcanic regions of the Canary Islands. It is a small, cushion-like plant that thrives in harsh, rocky environments, often growing on basaltic substrates. The plant has a compact growth habit with dense, gray-green foliage that is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low nutrient conditions. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters, and it reproduces through seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Tillaea basaltica is considered a vulnerable species."
