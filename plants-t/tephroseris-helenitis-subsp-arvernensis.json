    "intro": "Tephroseris helenitis subsp. arvernensis, commonly known as the Arvernian tephroseris, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern France. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive yellow-orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 1,000 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, forming dense spherical inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
