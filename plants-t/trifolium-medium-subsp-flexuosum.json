    "intro": "Trifolium medium subsp. flexuosum, commonly known as the creeping white clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically oval to lanceolate in shape and have a pale green color. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, which are a distinguishing feature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. This subspecies is known for its adaptability and is sometimes used in forage and soil stabilization."
