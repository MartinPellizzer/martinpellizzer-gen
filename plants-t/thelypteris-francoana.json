    "intro": "Thelypteris francoana, commonly known as the Franco's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides, where it thrives in high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Thelypteris francoana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
