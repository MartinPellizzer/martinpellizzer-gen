    "intro": "Tapeinidium firmulum, commonly known as the slender tapeinidium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators like bees and flies. The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity."
