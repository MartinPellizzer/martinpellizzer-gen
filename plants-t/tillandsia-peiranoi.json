    "intro": "Tillandsia peiranoi, commonly known as the Peir\u00e1n tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage is typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Tillandsia peiranoi is prized for its ornamental value and unique ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
