    "intro": "Tephroseris atropurpurea subsp. tomentosa, commonly known as the purple tephroseris, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy purple or pink flowers. The subspecies tomentosa is distinguished by its dense, woolly covering on the stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands or along riverbanks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
