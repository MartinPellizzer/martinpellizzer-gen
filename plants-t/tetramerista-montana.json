    "intro": "Tetramerista montana, commonly known as the mountain tetramerista, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a compact growth habit, with woody stems that form a rounded shape. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the bright yellow flowers. Tetramerista montana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
