    "intro": "Tristemma littorale, commonly known as coastal tristemma, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows near the shoreline, thriving in sandy or muddy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually opposite, elliptical in shape, and have a slightly rough texture. Tristemma littorale plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
