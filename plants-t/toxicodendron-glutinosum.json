    "intro": "Toxicodendron glutinosum, commonly known as the sticky rubber vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its climbing habit and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant's leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating that makes them slippery to the touch. It is also known for producing a sticky, resinous substance that can be harmful if contacted with the skin. This species is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value but requires careful handling due to its potentially irritating properties."
