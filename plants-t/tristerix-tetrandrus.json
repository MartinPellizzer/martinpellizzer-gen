    "intro": "Tristerix tetrandrus, commonly known as the Brazilian fern or the golden fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, feather-like fronds that are often bright green with a slight golden hue. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Tristerix tetrandrus is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
