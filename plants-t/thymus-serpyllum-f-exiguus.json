    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. exiguus, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical thymus species. The plant produces tiny, pink or white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its aromatic leaves are often used in culinary and medicinal applications."
