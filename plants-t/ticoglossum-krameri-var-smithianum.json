    "intro": "Ticoglossum krameri var. smithianum, commonly known as the Smith's beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the plantain family (Plantaginaceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant produces clusters of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
