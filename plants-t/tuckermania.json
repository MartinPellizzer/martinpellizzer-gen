It is characterized by its unique, lantern-shaped inflorescence that resembles a ghostly face, hence its common name. The plant is native to the eastern United States and thrives in woodland habitats. Tuckermania species are perennial herbs with slender, often hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers. Botanically, they are notable for their distinctive morphology and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
