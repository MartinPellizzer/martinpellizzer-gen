It features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in the late afternoon. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Trichodiadema pomeridianum is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil."
