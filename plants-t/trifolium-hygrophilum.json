    "intro": "Trifolium hygrophilum, commonly known as the water clover, is a species of legume native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of stems. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, streambanks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Trifolium hygrophilum plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
