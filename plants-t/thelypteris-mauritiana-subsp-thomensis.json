    "intro": "Thelypteris mauritiana subsp. thomensis, commonly known as the Tomense water fern, is a fern species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or near water bodies. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across suitable habitats. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that aids in its identification."
