    "intro": "Tessmannia korupensis, commonly known as the Korup tessmannia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the lowland rainforests of Cameroon. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and is often found in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss, Tessmannia korupensis is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for further study and protection."
