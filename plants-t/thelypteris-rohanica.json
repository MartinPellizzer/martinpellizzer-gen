    "intro": "Thelypteris rohanica, commonly known as the Rohan's shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. Thelypteris rohanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
