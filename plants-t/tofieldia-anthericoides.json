It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of streams. Tofieldia anthericoides is typically perennial and has a clumping growth habit, making it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
