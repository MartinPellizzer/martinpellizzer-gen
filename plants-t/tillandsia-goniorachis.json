    "intro": "Tillandsia goniorachis, commonly known as the silver-leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences that are often violet or purple in color. It is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth."
