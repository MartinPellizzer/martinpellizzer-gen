    "intro": "Tillandsia krukoffiana var. piepenbringii, commonly known as the Krukoff's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking orange or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding a vibrant contrast to its foliage. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
