    "intro": "Thelypteris micula, commonly known as the rock brake fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in rocky, shaded environments, often on limestone or sandstone substrates. The plant has slender, arching fronds with a dark green, leathery texture and serrated margins. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris micula is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
