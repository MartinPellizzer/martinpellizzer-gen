    "intro": "Thymus alfredae, commonly known as Alfred's thyme, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial with aromatic, tiny, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
