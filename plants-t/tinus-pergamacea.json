    "intro": "Tinus pergamacea, commonly known as the parchment lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Trapeliaceae. It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form, which adheres tightly to rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale yellow to white, with a smooth and waxy appearance. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found on limestone or sandstone substrates. This lichen is known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions due to its slow growth and resistance to desiccation."
