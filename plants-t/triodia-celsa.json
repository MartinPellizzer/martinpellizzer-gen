    "intro": "Triodia celsa, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and sharp, spiky leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant forms tussocks and is often found in sandy or rocky soils, contributing to soil stabilization. Triodia celsa is well adapted to drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively."
