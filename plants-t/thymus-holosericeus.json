    "intro": "Thymus holosericeus, commonly known as the woolly thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Thymus holosericeus is also valued for its aromatic leaves, which can be used in culinary and medicinal applications."
