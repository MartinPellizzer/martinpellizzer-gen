    "intro": "Tillandsia gentryana, commonly known as the Gentry's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
