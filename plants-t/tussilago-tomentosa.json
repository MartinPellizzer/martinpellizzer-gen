    "intro": "Tussilago tomentosa, commonly known as fuzzy lungwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs that give it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. Tussilago tomentosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
