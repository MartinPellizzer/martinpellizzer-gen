    "intro": "Terminalia biangulata, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elongated leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its aromatic wood, it has been historically valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
