    "intro": "Taraxacum macroceratodon, commonly known as the giant dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its large, yellow composite flower heads and distinctive, hairy leaves. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It produces a long, slender stem with a rosette of leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height. The seeds are dispersed by the wind via a parachute-like structure, typical of the genus Taraxacum."
