    "intro": "Tillandsia triticea var. ustulata, commonly known as the grassy air plant, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms a rosette structure, allowing it to efficiently collect moisture from the air. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a waxy coating that aids in water retention. This variety is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements in indoor environments."
