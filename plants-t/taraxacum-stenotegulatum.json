    "intro": "Taraxacum stenotegulatum, commonly known as the narrow-capped dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated stem that terminates in a bright yellow flower head. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its flowers produce wind-dispersed seeds, which are enclosed in a fluffy, white pappus. The species is notable for its small, compact structure and its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
