    "intro": "Tragacantha purshii, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert plains. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are succulent and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Tragacantha purshii is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
