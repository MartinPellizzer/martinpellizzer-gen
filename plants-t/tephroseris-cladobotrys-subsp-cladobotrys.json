    "intro": "Tephroseris cladobotrys subsp. cladobotrys, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, greenish-blue leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a single terminal head, which bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Due to its succulent leaves and drought tolerance, it is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
