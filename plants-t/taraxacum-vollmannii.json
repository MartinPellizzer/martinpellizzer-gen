It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disc flowers, which produce yellow petals and tubular florets, respectively. It is native to North America and thrives in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common and resilient weed."
