    "intro": "Tragia cuneata, commonly known as the narrowleaf tragia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Tragia cuneata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dry fields due to its adaptability to poor soil conditions. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural areas."
