    "intro": "Tillandsia inflata, commonly known as the inflated air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant's most distinctive feature is its inflated, balloon-like leaves that store water and nutrients. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Tillandsia inflata is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
