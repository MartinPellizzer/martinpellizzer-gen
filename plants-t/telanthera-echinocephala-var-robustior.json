    "intro": "Telanthera echinocephala var. robustior, commonly known as the robust thornapple, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its branched stems and spiny leaves, which provide a protective mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are often followed by spherical, spiny fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
