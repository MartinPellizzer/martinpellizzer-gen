    "intro": "Tillandsia pohliana, commonly known as the Pohl's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant, showy flowers that can range in color from white to pink and purple. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
