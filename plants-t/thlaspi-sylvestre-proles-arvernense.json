    "intro": "Thlaspi sylvestre proles arvernense, commonly known as the Arvernian rock cabbages, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, hairy leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes. The plant is native to mountainous regions of Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and Alps, where it thrives in rocky and calcareous soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and on limestone outcrops, adapting to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
