    "intro": "Tragia pedicillaris, commonly known as the hairy devil's backbone, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, characterized by its woody stems and dense, often thorny branches. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, elongated, spiny fruits. Tragia pedicillaris is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with mechanisms to store water and reduce transpiration. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
