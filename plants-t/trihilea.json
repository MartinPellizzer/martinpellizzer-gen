    "intro": "Trihilea, commonly known as the mountain daisy, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that typically feature yellow centers and white or pale blue petals. These plants are native to regions of southern Africa, particularly in the mountainous areas of Namibia and South Africa. Trihilea species are often found in rocky or gravelly soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid climates. They play an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in their native habitats."
