    "intro": "Triticum cereale var. turgidum, commonly known as durum wheat, is a variant of wheat characterized by its high gluten content and hard, amber-colored grains. It is primarily cultivated for its semolina, which is used to make pasta and couscous. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stems and spikelets that bear small, awned grains. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. This variety is known for its resilience to drought and its ability to produce high yields under suitable conditions."
