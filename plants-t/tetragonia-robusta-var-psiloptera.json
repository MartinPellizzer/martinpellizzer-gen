It is characterized by its succulent, lobed leaves that are often coated with a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. This variety is valued for its nutritional content and is sometimes cultivated as a leafy green vegetable."
