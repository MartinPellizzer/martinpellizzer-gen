    "intro": "Trifolium oreganum var. multiovulatum, commonly known as Oregon mountain clover, is a variant of the common clover species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open meadows and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
