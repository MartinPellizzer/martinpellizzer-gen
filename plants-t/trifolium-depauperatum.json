    "intro": "Trifolium depauperatum, commonly known as the poor man's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It thrives in poor soils and is often found in dry, rocky, or disturbed areas. Trifolium depauperatum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
