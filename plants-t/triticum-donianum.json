    "intro": "Triticum donianum, commonly known as Don's wheat, is a wild relative of cultivated wheat species. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in meadows and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets. Its genome contains valuable genetic diversity that can be used in breeding programs to improve agricultural wheat varieties. Triticum donianum is of interest to researchers due to its potential for enhancing disease resistance and stress tolerance in wheat crops."
