    "intro": "Telmatoblechnum serrulatum, commonly known as the Andean water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It thrives in cold, nutrient-rich waters and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant has a unique ability to survive in low-light conditions, making it well-adapted to its mountainous habitat. Its reproductive structures are typically found on the undersides of its leaves, and it plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its environment. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
