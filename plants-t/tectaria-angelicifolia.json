It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its large, intricate fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry roots that help anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically bi-lobed and have a velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Tectaria angelicifolia thrives in humid climates and is often found in forest understories where it receives dappled sunlight."
