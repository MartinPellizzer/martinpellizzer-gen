    "intro": "Tillandsia arnoldiana, commonly known as the Arnold's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers. It is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
