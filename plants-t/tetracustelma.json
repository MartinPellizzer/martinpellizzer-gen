    "intro": "Tetracustelma, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it can become an invasive species in certain areas."
