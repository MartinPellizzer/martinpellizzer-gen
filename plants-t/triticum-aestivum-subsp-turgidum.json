    "intro": "Triticum aestivum subsp. turgidum, commonly known as durum wheat, is a subspecies of wheat native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hard, amber-colored grains and high gluten content, which makes it ideal for pasta and semolina production. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike with several spikelets, each containing two to three florets. The botanical features of this subspecies contribute to its adaptability and agricultural importance."
