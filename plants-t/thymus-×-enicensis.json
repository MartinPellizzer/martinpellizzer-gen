    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 enicensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small pink or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and hardy nature make it suitable for coastal and Mediterranean climates. Thymus \u00d7 enicensis is also valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, similar to other thyme species."
