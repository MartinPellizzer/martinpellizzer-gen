    "intro": "Trifolium montanum rubens, commonly known as the red mountain clover, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three heart-shaped leaflets, and its small, clustered pink to red flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
