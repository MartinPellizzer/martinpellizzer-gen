    "intro": "Tetranthus ruderalis, commonly known as the common tetranthus, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is known for its rapid colonization of such habitats. Its leaves are usually alternate, lanceolate, and often covered in fine hairs. Tetranthus ruderalis produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, contributing to its role in pollinator habitats."
