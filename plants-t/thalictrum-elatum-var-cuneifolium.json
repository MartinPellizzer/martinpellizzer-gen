    "intro": "Thalictrum elatum var. cuneifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically narrow and elongated, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
