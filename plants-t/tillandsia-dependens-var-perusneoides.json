    "intro": "Tillandsia dependens var. perusneoides, commonly known as the Peruvian air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pink, adding ornamental value. This variety is popular among air plant enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
