    "intro": "Tapeinosperma pancheri, commonly known as the Pancheri sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elliptical, woody fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture with a glossy appearance. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
