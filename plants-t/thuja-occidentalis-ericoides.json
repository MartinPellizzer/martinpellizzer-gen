    "intro": "Thuja occidentalis ericoides, commonly known as the creeping thuja or bog thuja, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like foliage that forms a mat or low mound, typically reaching heights of less than 30 centimeters. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and along streambanks. Its small, dark green leaves are arranged in crossed pairs, and it produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its ornamental appeal in shaded, wetland gardens."
