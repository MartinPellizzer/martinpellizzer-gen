    "intro": "Tillandsia arequitae, commonly known as the Arequipa air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean highlands of Peru. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, fibrous roots that help it anchor to its host and absorb moisture from the air. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a layer of trichomes, which aid in water retention. Tillandsia arequitae is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, humid conditions with ample indirect light."
