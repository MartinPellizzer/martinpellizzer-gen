    "intro": "Tsuga canadensis var. alba-spica, commonly known as the white-spike hemlock, is a variant of the eastern hemlock. It is characterized by its distinctive white, spike-like cones that contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant is a coniferous evergreen, native to eastern North America. Its needles are typically longer and more slender than those of the typical hemlock. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique cone structure and foliage."
