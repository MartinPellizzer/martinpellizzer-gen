    "intro": "Thismia winkleri, commonly known as the Winkler's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the family Thismiaceae and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and chlorophyll, making it a unique photosynthetic adaptation. The plant produces small, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It relies on specific symbiotic fungi for nutrient uptake, as it cannot perform photosynthesis independently. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Thismia winkleri is considered a vulnerable species."
