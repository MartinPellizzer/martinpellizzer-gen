    "intro": "Trichophyllum praticola, commonly known as the common haircap moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant has dark green, wiry stems with leaves that are sharply pointed and arranged in two rows. Its spore-producing structures, called capsules, are borne on short, stalked shoots at the tips of the stems. Trichophyllum praticola is often found in temperate regions, particularly in woodlands and along stream banks."
