    "intro": "Triolena hygrophila, commonly known as the water triolena, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in inflorescences at the tips of the stems. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist or waterlogged soils. Triolena hygrophila is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
