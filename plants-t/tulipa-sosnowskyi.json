    "intro": "Tulipa sosnowskyi, commonly known as the Siberian tulip, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a distinctive purple or red stripe down the throat. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears one to three flowers, which bloom in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive. Tulipa sosnowskyi is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
