    "intro": "Trevia nudiflora, commonly known as the naked-flower trevia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its simple, often clustered inflorescences that lack bracts, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are usually alternate and elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Trevia nudiflora is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks."
