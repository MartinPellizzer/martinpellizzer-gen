    "intro": "Tsuga calcarea, commonly known as the white spruce, is a coniferous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including calcareous (limestone-rich) soils. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, and its needles are typically dark green with a smooth surface. Tsuga calcarea plays an important role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. It is also valued for its timber and has been used by indigenous peoples for centuries."
