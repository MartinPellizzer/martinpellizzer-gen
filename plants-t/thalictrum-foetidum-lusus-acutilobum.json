    "intro": "Thalictrum foetidum lusus acutilobum, commonly known as the sharp-lobed meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and subtle floral display."
