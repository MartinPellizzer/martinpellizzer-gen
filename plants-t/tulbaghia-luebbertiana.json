    "intro": "Tulbaghia luebbertiana, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a perennial bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features strap-shaped, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white or pinkish flowers in spring. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is drought-tolerant once established. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its bulbs are toxic if ingested, so care should be taken when handling it."
