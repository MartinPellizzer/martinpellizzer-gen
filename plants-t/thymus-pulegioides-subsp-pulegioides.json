    "intro": "Thymus pulegioides subsp. pulegioides, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, aromatic leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover. Its hardy nature and ability to spread vegetatively contribute to its widespread use in horticulture."
