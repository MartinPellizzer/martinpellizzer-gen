    "intro": "Trisetum cernuum var. canescens, commonly known as the silver-haired wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it its common name, and it typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and pond edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in wetland environments. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions."
