    "intro": "Tontelea crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved tontelea, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenia plants. The plant is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in its native habitat. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the wet season. Tontelea crassifolia is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
