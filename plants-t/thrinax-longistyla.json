    "intro": "Thrinax longistyla, commonly known as the long-styled palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Cuba and the Bahamas. This palm is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a drupe that turns from green to red as it matures. Thrinax longistyla is well adapted to coastal and sandy environments, making it a resilient species in tropical regions."
