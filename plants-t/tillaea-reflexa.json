    "intro": "Tillaea reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed tillia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense clusters of small, leathery, blue-green leaves. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, red berries. Tillaea reflexa thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops and is valued for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
