    "intro": "Trigonochilum dalessandroi, commonly known as the Dalessandro's orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, triangular-shaped sepals and petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small and delicate, with a range of colors from white to pale pink, and it blooms during the warmer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
