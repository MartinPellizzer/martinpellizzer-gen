    "intro": "Trifolium longipes var. reflexum, commonly known as the reflexed clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets that are often reflexed, or curled backward, giving it its specific variety name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used for soil stabilization."
