    "intro": "Trifolium gibbosum, commonly known as the cushion clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, contributing to its ornamental value. Trifolium gibbosum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky habitats. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
