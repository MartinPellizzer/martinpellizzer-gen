It is characterized by its distinctive kidney-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. It has a succulent stem and leaves, which help store water. Trichiogramme reniformis is often found in rocky soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
