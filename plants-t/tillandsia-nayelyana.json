    "intro": "Tillandsia nayelyana, commonly known as the N\u00e1yely's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, narrow leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Tillandsia nayelyana is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright, indirect light and regular misting to thrive."
