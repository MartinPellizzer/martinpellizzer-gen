    "intro": "Tragacantha affghana, commonly known as Afghan tragacanth, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its most notable feature is the production of a gelatinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in rocky soils with limited water availability."
