    "intro": "Thelypteris mapiriensis, commonly known as the Mapiri fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures on the underside. Thelypteris mapiriensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats."
