It features a compact, low-growing shrub with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its rocky habitat. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, thriving in well-drained soils. This variety is particularly noted for its resilience and ability to survive in harsh, high-altitude environments."
