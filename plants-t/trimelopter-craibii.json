    "intro": "Trimelopter craibii, commonly known as the Craib's trimelopter, is a rare and endemic fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds with a distinctive, slender structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous forest areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trimelopter craibii is considered a botanically significant but critically endangered species."
