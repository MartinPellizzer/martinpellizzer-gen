    "intro": "Taraxacum mexicanum, commonly known as Mexican dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in early spring, followed by the characteristic seed dispersal via the wind. The species is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments."
