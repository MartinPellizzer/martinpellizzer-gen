    "intro": "Telephium repens, commonly known as sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Telephium repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden settings for its delicate appearance."
