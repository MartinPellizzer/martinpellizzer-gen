    "intro": "Trichopilia turialbae, commonly known as the Turi\u00e1lba's trichopilia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. Its flowers, which are typically small and clustered, bloom in shades of white and pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
