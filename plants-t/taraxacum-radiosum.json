    "intro": "Taraxacum radiosum, commonly known as the lesser dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. It produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed with a white, pappus that aids in its spread. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is widespread across temperate regions."
