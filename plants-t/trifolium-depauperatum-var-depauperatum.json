    "intro": "Trifolium depauperatum var. depauperatum, commonly known as the poor man's clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three small, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
