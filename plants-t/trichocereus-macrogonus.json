    "intro": "Trichocereus macrogonus, commonly known as the \"Moon cactus\" or \"Pachypodium,\" is a cacti species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, segmented stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its unique appearance, with a rounded, bottle-like shape, makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening. However, it is important to note that it is often grafted onto other cacti species for aesthetic reasons, as it does not root easily on its own."
