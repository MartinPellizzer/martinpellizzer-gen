    "intro": "Tephrosia nubica subsp. arabica, commonly known as the Arabian tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, characterized by its small, pinnate leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and forage for wildlife. Additionally, it has been used traditionally in some regions for medicinal purposes."
