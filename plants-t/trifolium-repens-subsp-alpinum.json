It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a white or pale green coloration. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
