It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces compact grains that are typically pale yellow in color. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions. This variety is of interest for its potential in breeding programs aimed at improving wheat tolerance to harsh climates."
