    "intro": "Triticum sativum var. pyramidale, commonly known as the pyramid wheat, is a variety of wheat characterized by its distinctive tall, slender spikes. It is a cereal grain that belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is primarily cultivated for its edible seeds. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with long, narrow leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical features include hollow stems, parallel-veined leaves, and small, two-lobed florets arranged in a compact spike. This variety is often used in agricultural research due to its unique morphology and potential for breeding programs."
