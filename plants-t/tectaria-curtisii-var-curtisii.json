    "intro": "Tectaria curtisii var. curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a leathery texture and a distinctive arrangement of sori. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
