It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the sediment in its aquatic environment. Tursitis elatine is an important component of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
