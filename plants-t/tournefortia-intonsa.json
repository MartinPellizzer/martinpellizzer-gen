    "intro": "Tournefortia intonsa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tournefortia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, including countries like Kenya and Tanzania, and is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It is generally drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its spread in its natural habitat."
