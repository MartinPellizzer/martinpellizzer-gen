    "intro": "Taraxacum togakushiense, commonly known as the Togakushi dandelion, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in Japan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and heart-shaped basal leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. It has small, rough-textured leaves and produces a distinctive, fluffy seed head that aids in wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
