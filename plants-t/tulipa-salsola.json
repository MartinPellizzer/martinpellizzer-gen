    "intro": "Tulipa salsola, commonly known as desert tulip, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant has a short, sturdy stem and produces basal leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and are adapted to withstand harsh desert conditions. Tulipa salsola is valued for its ornamental beauty and resilience in extreme environments."
