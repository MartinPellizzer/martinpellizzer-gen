    "intro": "Tetraena waterlotii, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that access groundwater. Its unique morphology and resilience make it an important species in desert ecosystems."
