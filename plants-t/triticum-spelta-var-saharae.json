    "intro": "Triticum spelta var. saharae, commonly known as desert spelt, is a rare and ancient wheat variety native to arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its drought-resistant traits and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant produces small, hardy grains that are rich in nutrients and proteins. It has a shorter growth cycle compared to common wheat, making it suitable for cultivation in semi-arid climates. Due to its unique genetic makeup, it is of interest for breeding programs aimed at developing climate-resilient crops."
