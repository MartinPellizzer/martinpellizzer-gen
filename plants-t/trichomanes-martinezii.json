    "intro": "Trichomanes martinezii, commonly known as the Martinez's spikemoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Huperordales. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with upright, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. Trichomanes martinezii is characterized by its unique sporangia, which are clustered in small, stalked structures called strobila. This plant plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
