    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum subsp. tricoccum, commonly known as einkorn wheat, is a wild wheat species native to the Fertile Crescent. It is a diploid species with a genome size of approximately 1.5 gigabases, making it one of the smallest cereal genomes. The plant has slender, upright stems with long, narrow leaves and produces spikelets that bear small, glabrous grains. Its botanical features include a compact inflorescence and a unique glume structure that distinguishes it from other wheat species. Einkorn wheat is valued for its high protein content and ancient grain qualities, contributing to its significance in both agricultural and archaeological studies."
