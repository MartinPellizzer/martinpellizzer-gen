    "intro": "Thymus nummularius, commonly known as silver thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces tiny, pale pink to lavender flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its aromatic leaves are often used in cooking and traditional medicine."
