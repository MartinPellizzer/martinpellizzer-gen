    "intro": "Tectaria papuana, commonly known as the Papuan tectaria, is a fern native to the tropical regions of Papua and nearby islands. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a rough, scaly texture. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often on rocky or forested substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Tectaria papuana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
