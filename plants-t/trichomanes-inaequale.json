    "intro": "Trichomanes inaequale, commonly known as the unequal maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-bearing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes inaequale is notable for its unique morphology and is often used in horticultural collections due to its ornamental value."
