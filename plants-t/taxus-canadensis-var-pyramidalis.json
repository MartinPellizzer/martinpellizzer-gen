    "intro": "Taxus canadensis var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal yew, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to eastern North America. It features dense, scale-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in tight, pyramidal clusters, giving it a distinctive, conical shape. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing the potent toxin taxine. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its neat appearance and year-round foliage. This variety is particularly valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate urban conditions."
