    "intro": "Trifolium medium var. strictum, commonly known as narrow-leaf clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale purple, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is valued as a forage crop and in ecological restoration projects."
