    "intro": "Taraxacum aequilibratum, commonly known as the balanced dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a long, hollow stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The flower produces a spherical seed head, known as a pappus, which is adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. This plant is often considered a weed but has ecological and historical significance."
