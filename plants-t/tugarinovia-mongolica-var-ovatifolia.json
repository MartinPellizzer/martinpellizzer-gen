    "intro": "Tugarinovia mongolica var. ovatifolia, commonly known as the Mongolian ovate-leaved tugarinovia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the grasslands of Mongolia. It is characterized by its ovate-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
