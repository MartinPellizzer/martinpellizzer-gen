    "intro": "Thalictrum podocarpum, commonly known as the nodding meadow-rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream sides. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces follicles that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Thalictrum podocarpum is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and delicate appearance."
