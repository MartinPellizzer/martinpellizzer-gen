These plants are characterized by their hollow, jointed stems and are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Thamnocalamus species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and are also valued for their ecological roles in soil stabilization.

Botanically, they are distinguished by their leaf morphology and inflorescence structures, which vary among species."
