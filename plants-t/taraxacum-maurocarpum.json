    "intro": "Taraxacum maurocarpum, commonly known as the black-root dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a bright yellow composite flower that develops into a spiky, wind-dispersed seed head. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant's dark, thick roots are a distinguishing feature, contributing to its common name."
