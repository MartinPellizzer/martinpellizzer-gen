    "intro": "Teclea welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia tree, is a unique succulent plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola. It is characterized by its two large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length and remain functional for decades. The plant has a deep taproot system that allows it to access water from deep underground, enabling it to survive in arid environments. Teclea welwitschii produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, cone-like structures containing its seeds. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a living fossil and is protected in its natural habitat."
