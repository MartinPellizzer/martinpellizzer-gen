    "intro": "Taraxacum dilutiroseum, commonly known as the pale yellow dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale, fuzzy leaves and a hollow, ridged stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides. Its flowers produce wind-dispersed seeds, which are enclosed in a distinctive parachute-like structure. This species is notable for its subtle coloration and its role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
