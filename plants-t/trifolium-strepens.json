    "intro": "Trifolium strepens, commonly known as the creeping clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along stream banks. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, and it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Trifolium strepens is also valued for its role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients."
