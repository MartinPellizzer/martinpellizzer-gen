    "intro": "Tithymalus kozlovii, commonly known as the Kozlov's tithymalus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in temperate to alpine climates. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Tithymalus kozlovii is considered a rare and endangered species."
