    "intro": "Taraxacum officinale proles palustre, commonly known as the marsh dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces a hollow, leafless stem that bears a single yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
