It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas or along the edges of forests. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and horticultural applications."
