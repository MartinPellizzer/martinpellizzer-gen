    "intro": "Teucrium supinum, commonly known as creeping germander, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Teucrium supinum is often found in rocky or dry soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties."
