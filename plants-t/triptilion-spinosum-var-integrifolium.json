    "intro": "Triptilion spinosum var. integrifolium, commonly known as the smoothleaf spiny tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It features lance-shaped leaves that are entire, meaning they have no teeth or notches along the edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in compact clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
