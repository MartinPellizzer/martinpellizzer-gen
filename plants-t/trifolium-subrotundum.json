    "intro": "Trifolium subrotundum, commonly known as the rounded clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Trifolium subrotundum is a perennial herb that plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
