    "intro": "Terminalia simulans, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that turn bright yellow in autumn. The tree produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and used in traditional medicine."
