It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like projections on its seed pods. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of long, curved seed pods. Its roots are known for their ability to exude a sticky, gum-like substance, which has been used historically in various medicinal and industrial applications. The botanical features of Tragacantha cornuta make it an interesting subject for both ecological and pharmacological study."
