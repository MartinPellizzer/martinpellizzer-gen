    "intro": "Tillandsia bandensis, commonly known as the Bandera air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has dense, gray-green foliage that is adapted to trap moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and white or pale pink, emerging from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia bandensis is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
