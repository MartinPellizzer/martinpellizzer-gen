    "intro": "Triosteum perfoliatum var. glaucescens, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, branching stems that often have a bluish-gray hue, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens."
