    "intro": "Trigonachras obliqua, commonly known as the narrowleaf false nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptic to lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often borne on slender stalks. Its stems are square in cross-section, a common trait among plants in the mint family. Trigonachras obliqua thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
