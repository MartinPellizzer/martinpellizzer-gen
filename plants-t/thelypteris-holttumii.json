    "intro": "Thelypteris holttumii, commonly known as the Holttum's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Thelypteris holttumii is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
