    "intro": "Tuberaria globulariifolia var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf globular lichen, is a rare and delicate lichen species characterized by its compact, globular growth form. It typically forms dense, rounded colonies on rock surfaces, especially in humid and shaded environments. The plant's thallus is crust-like, with a smooth, often glossy surface that can vary in color from pale yellow to orange. It is primarily found in temperate regions, where it thrives in moist, shaded microhabitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health and is often used in ecological studies."
