    "intro": "Tillandsia subandina, commonly known as the Andean air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes Mountains. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically during the cooler months. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
