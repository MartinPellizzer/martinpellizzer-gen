    "intro": "Torreya nucifera var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate Chinese torreya, is a variant of the Chinese torreya, characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit. It is a member of the Taxaceae family, known for its coniferous characteristics. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are often dispersed by birds. This variant is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments."
