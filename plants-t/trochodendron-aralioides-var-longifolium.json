    "intro": "Trochodendron aralioides var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved trochodendron, is a rare evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves that are elongated and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive, winged fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
