    "intro": "Trifolium spinulosum var. triste, commonly known as the weeping clover, is a rare and delicate species of the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, drooping stems and small, trifoliate leaves with finely serrated edges. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
