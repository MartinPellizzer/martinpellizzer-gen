    "intro": "Tillandsia santiagoensis, commonly known as the Santiago air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette structure, which helps it collect moisture from the air. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Tillandsia santiagoensis is well adapted to humid, high-altitude environments and requires bright, indirect light to thrive."
