It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. This plant has a complex thalloid structure with a central axis and lateral branches. It reproduces through spores, which are released from small, cup-like structures called sporangia. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Trichomanes inopinatum is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
