    "intro": "Tessaria ambigua var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower tessaria, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, compound leaves that are typically finely divided. The plant produces a single, umbel-like inflorescence at the tip of each branch, consisting of small white or greenish-white flowers. It is native to certain regions of South America and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists studying plant morphology and adaptation."
