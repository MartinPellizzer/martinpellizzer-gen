    "intro": "Taraxacum frisicum, commonly known as the Frisian dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the Netherlands and parts of northern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed with a white pappus, aiding in its propagation across open areas. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and coastal regions. Taraxacum frisicum is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
