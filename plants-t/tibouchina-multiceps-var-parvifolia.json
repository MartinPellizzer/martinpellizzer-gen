    "intro": "Tibouchina multiceps var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved tibouchina, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are smaller than those of the typical Tibouchina multiceps. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to almost white. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a decorative plant in tropical landscapes."
