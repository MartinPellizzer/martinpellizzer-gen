    "intro": "Thalictrum hybridum, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. Thalictrum hybridum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. It is valued in gardens for its delicate appearance and ecological benefits to pollinators."
