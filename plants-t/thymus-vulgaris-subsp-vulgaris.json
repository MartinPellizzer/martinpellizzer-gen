    "intro": "Thymus vulgaris subsp. vulgaris, commonly known as thyme, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant leaves and pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its aromatic properties are due to the presence of essential oils, including thymol and carvacrol. Thyme is widely used in culinary and medicinal applications for its antimicrobial and antioxidant benefits."
