It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris mingchegensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
