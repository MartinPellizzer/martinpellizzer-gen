    "intro": "Tarenna pavettoides subsp. gillmanii, commonly known as Gillman's tarenna, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
