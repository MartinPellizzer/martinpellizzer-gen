It belongs to the family Pinaceae and is characterized by its needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally along the branches. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its hardiness and ornamental qualities. This variety is distinct from other Tsuga species due to its unique leaf shape and growth habits."
