    "intro": "Thelypteris fideleae, commonly known as the faithful maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Thelypteris fideleae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, fern-like foliage."
