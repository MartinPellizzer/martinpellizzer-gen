    "intro": "Trisetum fuscum, commonly known as the black-haired wood grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered in dark, hairy structures, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. The inflorescence consists of a single, dense spikelet that is often concealed by the foliage, making it less conspicuous than other grasses."
