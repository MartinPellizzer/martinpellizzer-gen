    "intro": "Taraxacum cuspidatum, commonly known as the prairie dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow, composite flower head. The plant produces a long, hollow stem with a distinctive, spiky pappus that aids in seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Taraxacum cuspidatum is adapted to full sun and is often found in regions with temperate climates."
