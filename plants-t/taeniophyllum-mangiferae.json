    "intro": "Taeniophyllum mangiferae, commonly known as the mango orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a complex structure typical of orchids. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of air humidity and indirect light. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
