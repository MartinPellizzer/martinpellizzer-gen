    "intro": "Tripteris clandestina, commonly known as the hidden triple-wing fern, is a rare and elusive species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Tripteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds with a unique tripartite structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in the canopy of ancient forests. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are pollinated by wind, and it produces spores rather than seeds for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tripteris clandestina is considered a vulnerable species."
