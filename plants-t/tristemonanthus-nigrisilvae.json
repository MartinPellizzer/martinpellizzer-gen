    "intro": "Tristemonanthus nigrisilvae, commonly known as the black forest nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the dense, humid forests of West Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its dark green, broad leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically dark purple or black when mature. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in undergrowth layers of tropical rainforests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a lesser-known but ecologically significant species within its native range."
