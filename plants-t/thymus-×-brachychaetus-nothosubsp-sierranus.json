    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 brachychaetus nothosubsp. sierranus, commonly known as Sierra thyme, is a hybrid plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its botanical features include glandular hairs on the leaves, which contribute to its distinct scent. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its hybrid origin and limited distribution."
