    "intro": "Tripsacum myurus, commonly known as the wild maize or false corn, is a perennial grass native to South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, with small, two-lobed flowers. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed or semi-arid environments. Tripsacum myurus has historical significance in indigenous agriculture and is sometimes used in modern horticulture for its ornamental value."
