It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and vibrant red or purple flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae and is often found in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and wetlands. Its roots are fibrous and can spread extensively, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural settings. Talinum portulacifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal but can be invasive in certain environments."
