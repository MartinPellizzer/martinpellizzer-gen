    "intro": "Triticum urartu var. nigrum, commonly known as black rye, is a wild species of wheat native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its dark, glabrous grains and compact, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky or semi-arid environments and has a short growth cycle. Its genetic makeup is of interest to researchers due to its potential contributions to modern wheat breeding programs. This variety is also valued for its use in traditional and artisanal food products."
