    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 carolipaui, commonly known as the hybrid thyme, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Thymus serpyllum (wild thyme) and Thymus vulgaris (common thyme), resulting in a plant with distinctive aromatic foliage. The leaves are small, oval, and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are typically pink or lavender, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is widely cultivated in gardens and herbal practices."
