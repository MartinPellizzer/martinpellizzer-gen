    "intro": "Taraxacum scaturiginosum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and produces bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often becoming invasive in some areas. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The seeds are dispersed by wind, with distinctive pappus structures that aid in their spread."
