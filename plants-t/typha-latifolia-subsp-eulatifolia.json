    "intro": "Typha latifolia subsp. eulatifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf cattail, is a wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves and a dense, cylindrical flower spike that produces fluffy seeds. This subspecies thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, lake edges, and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense stands that stabilize shorelines. The plant plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
