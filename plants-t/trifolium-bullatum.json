    "intro": "Trifolium bullatum, commonly known as the bull's clover, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Trifolium bullatum is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It is also a food source for various pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
