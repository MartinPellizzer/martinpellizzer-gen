    "intro": "Tetraria capitata, commonly known as the clustered bladderworts, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of bladders used for trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often arranged in a dense cluster at the top of the plant. Tetraria capitata is a carnivorous plant that relies on its specialized structures to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments."
