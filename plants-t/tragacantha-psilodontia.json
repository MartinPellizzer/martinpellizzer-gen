    "intro": "Tragacantha psilodontia, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. The plant is characterized by its woody structure, compound leaves, and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It produces a gum resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access underground water sources."
