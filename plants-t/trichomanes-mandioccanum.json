    "intro": "Trichomanes mandioccanum, commonly known as the Brazilian maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, pale green fronds that resemble those of the common maidenhair fern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Due to habitat loss, Trichomanes mandioccanum is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
