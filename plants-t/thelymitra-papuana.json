    "intro": "Thelymitra papuana, commonly known as the Papuan sun orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of New Guinea and nearby islands. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrate. Thelymitra papuana is often found growing on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments."
