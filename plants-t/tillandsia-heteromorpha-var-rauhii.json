It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water. Its flowers are typically purple or violet, adding ornamental value. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity."
