    "intro": "Taraxacum gesticulans, commonly known as the waving dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy white seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows, thriving in well-drained soils. It has a rosette of basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stem is usually short and upright. The species is known for its distinctive, swaying movement of the flower head, which gives it its common name."
