    "intro": "Trichoglottis sitihasmahae, commonly known as the Sitihasmahae orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, aerial roots and compact, pseudobulbous structure. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive yellow lip, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
