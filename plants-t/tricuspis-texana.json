    "intro": "Tricuspis texana, commonly known as the Texas tricuspis, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Texas. It is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Its botanical features include hairy stems and showy, pinkish-white petals that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
