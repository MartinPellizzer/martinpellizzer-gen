    "intro": "Tacca oceanica, commonly known as the \"bat plant\" or \"tongue of the night,\" is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, dark purple, waxy leaves that resemble the shape of a bat's wings. The plant produces strikingly ornamental flowers that are often described as resembling a human face or a tongue, with a central red or orange bloom surrounded by white petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Tacca oceanica is often cultivated for its unique and dramatic appearance in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
