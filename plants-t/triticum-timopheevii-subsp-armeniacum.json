    "intro": "Triticum timopheevii subsp. armeniacum, commonly known as Armenian wild wheat, is a wild grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its slender, spike-like inflorescence and small, glabrous grains. This subspecies is closely related to domesticated wheat and is often studied for its potential in genetic research and crop improvement. It thrives in temperate climates and is typically found in rocky or semi-arid habitats. The plant has a long growing season and is adapted to low-nutrient soils."
