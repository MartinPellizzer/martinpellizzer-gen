    "intro": "Tovaria wardii, commonly known as the Ward's tovaria, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and fragrant, white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed, which is typically dispersed by animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tovaria wardii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
