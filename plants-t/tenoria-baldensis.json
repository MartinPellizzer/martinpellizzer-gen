It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its erect stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
