    "intro": "Trifolium subterraneum subsp. yanninicum, commonly known as the Greek clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in soil stabilization. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
