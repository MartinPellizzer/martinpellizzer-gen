    "intro": "Tragacantha rigidula, commonly known as the rigid thorned tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a gum resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a thickening agent. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Tragacantha rigidula is adapted to dry climates and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats."
