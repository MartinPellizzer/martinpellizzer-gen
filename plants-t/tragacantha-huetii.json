    "intro": "Tragacantha huetii, commonly known as the Huet's tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces a valuable gum, similar to tragacanth, which has been used historically in medicine and as a food additive. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
