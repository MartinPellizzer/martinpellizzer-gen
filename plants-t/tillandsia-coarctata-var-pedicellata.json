    "intro": "Tillandsia coarctata var. pedicellata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, and it produces small, white or pale green flowers. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
