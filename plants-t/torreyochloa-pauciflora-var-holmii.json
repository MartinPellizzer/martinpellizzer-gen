    "intro": "Torreyochloa pauciflora var. holmii, commonly known as the Holm's sparseflower grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered with a layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is noted for its low growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
