    "intro": "Taeniophyllum exuperei, commonly known as the velvet twayblade, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and slender, erect stems that bear small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
