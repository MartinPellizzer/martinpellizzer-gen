    "intro": "Taraxacum calamistratum, commonly known as the scurf-pappus dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive pappus, a crown of bristles that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. The species is noted for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
