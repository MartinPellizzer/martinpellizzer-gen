    "intro": "Triticum repens arundinaceum, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread extensively across moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often used in traditional herbal medicine. It is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in agricultural and ecological settings. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
