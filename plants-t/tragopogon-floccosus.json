    "intro": "Tragopogon floccosus, commonly known as the downy thistle, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage and a composite flower head that matures into a fluffy seed head. Native to the western United States, it thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into white, feathery seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Tragopogon floccosus is often considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil."
