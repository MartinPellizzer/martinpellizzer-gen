    "intro": "Taraxacum rupicola, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers produce small, wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. The species is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
