    "intro": "Theriophonum minutum, commonly known as the dwarf ghostplant, is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant found in wetlands and marshy areas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and tiny, greenish flowers. The plant is often found growing in shallow water or on the edges of ponds, where it can receive sufficient sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and often submerged, while its flowers are borne in small, clustered umbels. Theriophonum minutum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
