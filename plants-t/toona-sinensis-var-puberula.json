    "intro": "Toona sinensis var. puberula, commonly known as the Chinese silk floss tree, is a variant of the Toona sinensis species native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by distinctive, fluffy, white seed pods that resemble silk floss, giving it its common name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of fiber. The leaves and seeds have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
