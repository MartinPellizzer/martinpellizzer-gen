    "intro": "Tulipa brachyanthera, commonly known as the Turk's cap lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to Turkey and the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing showy, single flowers that are often adorned with a distinctive red or purple spot at the base. Tulipa brachyanthera is well-suited for rock gardens and well-drained soils, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance and hardiness."
