    "intro": "Tithonia longiradiata, commonly known as the Mexican sunflower, is a tropical shrub native to Central America and parts of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow-orange flowers with prominent red centers, which bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges and is often used as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant appearance. It is also valued in agriculture as a green manure crop because of its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Tithonia longiradiata thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it adaptable to various tropical and subtropical climates."
