    "intro": "Triticum durum var. cauhordeiforme, commonly known as durum wheat with a cauhordeiforme variant, is a botanical variant of durum wheat characterized by its unique morphological features. This variety exhibits a distinctive seed shape and structure, which can influence its agronomic performance and end-use properties. It belongs to the Poaceae family, sharing the typical grass plant characteristics such as hollow stems and parallel-veined leaves. The cauhordeiforme variant is notable for its specific growth habits and may possess traits of interest for breeding programs. Its botanical study contributes to understanding genetic diversity within wheat species."
