    "intro": "Thottea terengganuensis, commonly known as the Terengganu thottea, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal areas of Terengganu, Malaysia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its distinctive inflorescence, which consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant thrives in wet, saline environments, often found in mangrove swamps and tidal flats. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to withstand the humid and salty conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
