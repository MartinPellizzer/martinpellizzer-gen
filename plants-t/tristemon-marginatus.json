    "intro": "Tristemon marginatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed tristemon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters, with slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that have a distinctive pale green margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, often with a slight reddish tinge. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Tristemon marginatus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
