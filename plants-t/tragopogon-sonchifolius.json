    "intro": "Tragopogon sonchifolius, commonly known as the common goadweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and bright yellow flowers that resemble dandelions. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and a distinctive central vein. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily in disturbed soils. Tragopogon sonchifolius is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas where it thrives in full sun."
