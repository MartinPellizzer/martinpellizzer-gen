It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach several meters in height. The plant produces striking yellow to orange spines, which give it its common name. Its flowers are typically large, showy, and bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. This cactus is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
