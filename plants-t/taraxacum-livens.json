    "intro": "Taraxacum livens, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces a single, hollow, hairless stem that rises from the center of the rosette. Its flowers are yellow and form a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Taraxacum livens is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils."
