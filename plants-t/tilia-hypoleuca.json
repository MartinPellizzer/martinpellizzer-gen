    "intro": "Tilia hypoleuca, commonly known as the white-treed maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often pale green beneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruits are samaras, which are winged seeds that aid in wind dispersal. The bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often found in moist, wooded areas."
