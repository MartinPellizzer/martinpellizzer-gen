    "intro": "Thelypteris urdanetensis, commonly known as the UrdaNet fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the mountainous regions of northern South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris urdanetensis thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky outcrops. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
