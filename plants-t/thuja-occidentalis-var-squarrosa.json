    "intro": "Thuja occidentalis var. squarrosa, commonly known as the American arborvitae or northern white cedar, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and scale-like foliage that turns a bluish-green in winter. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. Its leaves are arranged in flat, crossed whorls, giving the tree a distinctive appearance. This variety is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
