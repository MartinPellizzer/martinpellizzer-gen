    "intro": "Tephrocactus malyanus, commonly known as the Malyan's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically ribbed and covered in white or grayish spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Tephrocactus malyanus is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its structure and growth habits make it a unique example of desert flora with specialized features for water conservation."
