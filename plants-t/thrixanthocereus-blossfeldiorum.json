    "intro": "Thrixanthocereus blossfeldiorum, commonly known as the Blossfeld's night bloomer, is a cactus species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in white to grayish spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, opening at night and lasting only a single day. These flowers are pollinated primarily by moths and bats, which are attracted to the plant's strong fragrance. Thrixanthocereus blossfeldiorum is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for desert gardens."
