    "intro": "Trichipteris kuhnii, commonly known as the Kuhn's fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect light. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichipteris kuhnii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
