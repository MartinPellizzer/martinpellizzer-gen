    "intro": "Telis kotschyi, commonly known as the Kotschyi's telis, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in dry, harsh environments. Its leaves are finely divided and often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Telis kotschyi is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
