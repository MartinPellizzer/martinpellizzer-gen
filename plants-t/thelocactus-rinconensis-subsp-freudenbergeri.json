    "intro": "Thelocactus rinconensis subsp. freudenbergeri, commonly known as the Freudenberger's thorned cactus, is a rare and compact cactus native to the Mexican state of Oaxaca. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in sharp, spiny areoles. The plant produces clusters of white, tubular flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
