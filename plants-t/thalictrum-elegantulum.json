    "intro": "Thalictrum elegantulum, commonly known as the slender meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features finely divided, feathery leaves that create a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early to mid-summer, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and is often found in wetlands or along stream edges. Thalictrum elegantulum is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits to pollinators."
