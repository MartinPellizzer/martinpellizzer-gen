    "intro": "Tomentaurum niveum, commonly known as the snow-tufted plant, is a unique species characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering on its stems and leaves. This plant is native to high-altitude regions and thrives in cold, arid environments. Its foliage is typically grayish-white due to the presence of fine, soft hairs that help insulate it from extreme temperatures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. Due to its specialized adaptations, Tomentaurum niveum is often found in rocky or alpine habitats where few other plants can survive."
