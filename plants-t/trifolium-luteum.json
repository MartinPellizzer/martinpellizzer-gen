    "intro": "Trifolium luteum, commonly known as yellow clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small yellow flowers that bloom in spikes. Native to Europe, it thrives in meadows and grasslands, often growing in sunny, well-drained soils. The plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and fixes nitrogen, enriching the soil. It is also a valuable source of nectar for bees and other pollinators."
