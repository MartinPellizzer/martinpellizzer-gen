It belongs to the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is found in dry, inland regions of its native habitat. Its unique morphology allows it to conserve water efficiently in harsh conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
