It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, and it produces a fragrant bloom during the spring and early summer.
