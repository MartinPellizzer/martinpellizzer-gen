    "intro": "Tetraplasandra waianensis var. palehuana, commonly known as the palehuana hibiscus, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the tropical rainforests of Hawaii. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically pink or white in color. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture, and it produces fruit that contains numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical treasure."
