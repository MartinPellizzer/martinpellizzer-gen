    "intro": "Triticum urartu var. albonigricans, commonly known as the black wheat or albo-nigricans wheat, is a wild relative of modern wheat species. It is characterized by its dark-colored grains and is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and western Asia. This variety exhibits a range of morphological features, including semi-dormant or non-dormant seeds, which influence its germination behavior. It is often studied for its genetic diversity and potential contributions to wheat improvement programs. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and has a short growing season."
