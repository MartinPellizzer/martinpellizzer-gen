    "intro": "Tillandsia atrococcinea, commonly known as the blood-red air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its striking red or orange bracts are often mistaken for flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant lacks traditional roots and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to maintain its health."
