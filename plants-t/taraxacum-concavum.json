    "intro": "Taraxacum concavum, commonly known as the hollow dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a waxy coating. The plant produces a hollow, thin-stemmed flower stalk that bears a single, composite flower head composed of many small, yellow, rayless florets. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like structure called a pappus. This species is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, and it is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
