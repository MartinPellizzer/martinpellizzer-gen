    "intro": "Tillandsia intumescens var. intumescens, commonly known as the wooly tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, fuzzy trichomes, which help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
