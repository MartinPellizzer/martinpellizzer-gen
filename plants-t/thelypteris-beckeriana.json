    "intro": "Thelypteris beckeriana, commonly known as the Becker's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris beckeriana thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its distinctive appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
