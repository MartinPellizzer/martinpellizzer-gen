    "intro": "Trichocereus tarijensis, commonly known as the Tarije\u00f1a cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of Bolivia and Peru. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, green stem and spiny areoles. The plant produces large, white or pale pink flowers that bloom at night, a trait common among many cacti in the night-blooming group. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Trichocereus tarijensis is also known for its potential psychoactive properties due to the presence of mescaline."
