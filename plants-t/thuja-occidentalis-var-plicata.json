    "intro": "Thuja occidentalis var. plicata, commonly known as the western red cedar, is a variant of the eastern arborvitae. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, giving it a dense, almost feathery appearance. The plant is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green cones, which are typically wind-pollinated. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resistance to pests and diseases."
