    "intro": "Tragacantha devia, commonly known as the desert tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Tragacantha devia is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots and a capacity to store water in its tissues. Its sap has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural gum."
