    "intro": "Tanacetum willkommii, commonly known as German tansy, is a perennial herb native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and yellow button-like flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Its aromatic foliage and flowers attract beneficial insects, making it a valuable addition to pollinator gardens. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
