    "intro": "Trophaeum marmoratum, commonly known as the marble lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, mottled leaves that resemble marble patterns, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers. Trophaeum marmoratum is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
