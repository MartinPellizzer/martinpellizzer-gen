    "intro": "Taraxacum tenue, commonly known as the slender dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a hollow, hairless stem. The plant produces a single, yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy pappus for wind dispersal of its seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. Taraxacum tenue is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in various environmental conditions."
