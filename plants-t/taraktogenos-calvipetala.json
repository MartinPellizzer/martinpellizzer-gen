    "intro": "Taraktogenos calvipetala, commonly known as the woolly-flowered taraktogenos, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive, woolly appearance, with hairy leaves and stems that give it a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated by gardeners interested in native or drought-tolerant plants."
