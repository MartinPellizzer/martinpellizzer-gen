    "intro": "Triticum nardus var. pubescens, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild wheat species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in dry, disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. It is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in areas with poor soil conditions. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
