    "intro": "Tecophilaea cyanocrocus f. typica, commonly known as the blue crocus bellflower, is a species native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from November to December. The plant is a perennial herb with a compact growth habit, featuring succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its arid environment. Its flowers are tubular and often hang downward, forming clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
