    "intro": "Taraxacum obovatifrons, commonly known as the broad-fronded dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces a single, upright flowering stem topped with a spherical cluster of yellow flowers, which later develop into the familiar parachute-like seed heads. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. This species is often found in meadows, roadsides, and garden beds, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and supports pollinators."
