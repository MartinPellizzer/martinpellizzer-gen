    "intro": "Timonius cuneatus, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Timonius cuneatus is valued for its resilience and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous terrain."
