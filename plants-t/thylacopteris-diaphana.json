    "intro": "Thylacopteris diaphana, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often translucent or semi-transparent, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are typically located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Thylacopteris diaphana is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
