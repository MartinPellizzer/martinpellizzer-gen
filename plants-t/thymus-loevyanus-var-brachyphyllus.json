It features dense, compact foliage with small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in spring, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties, similar to other thyme species."
