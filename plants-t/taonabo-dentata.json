    "intro": "Taonabo dentata, commonly known as the toothed leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its fronds that have a serrated or toothed margin, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
