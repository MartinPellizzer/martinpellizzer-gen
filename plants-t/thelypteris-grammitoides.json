    "intro": "Thelypteris grammitoides, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to rocky substrates. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a slender, arching appearance that contributes to its ornamental value."
