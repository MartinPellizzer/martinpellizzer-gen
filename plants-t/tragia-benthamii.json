    "intro": "Tragia benthamii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tragia, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species characterized by its slender stems and small, often hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Tragia benthamii is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with mechanisms to reduce water loss and tolerate extreme temperatures. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed or sandy soils."
