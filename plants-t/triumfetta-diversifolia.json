    "intro": "Triumfetta diversifolia, commonly known as the variable triumfetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, and it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its seeds are encased in a fleshy, hairy capsule that disperses easily by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
