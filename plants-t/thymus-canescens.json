    "intro": "Thymus canescens, commonly known as eastern thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, grey-green leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or gravelly habitats. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its use in culinary and medicinal applications. Thymus canescens is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
