    "intro": "Tetraberlinia polyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leafed tetraberlinia, is a rare and little-known plant species native to specific regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
