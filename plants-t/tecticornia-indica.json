    "intro": "Tecticornia indica, commonly known as the Indian glassworts, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Amaranthaceae. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline or coastal environments, often found in sandy soils along shorelines. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid conditions. Its small, greenish flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Tecticornia indica is adapted to withstand high salinity and can be used in ecological restoration projects in coastal areas."
