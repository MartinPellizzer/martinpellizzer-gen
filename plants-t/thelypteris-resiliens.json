    "intro": "Thelypteris resiliens, commonly known as the resilient shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are robust, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Thelypteris resiliens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
