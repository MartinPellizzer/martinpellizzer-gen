    "intro": "Tipularia odorata, commonly known as the sweet-scented orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its roots are often covered in a dense, white mycorrhizal sheath. The flowers emit a sweet, spicy fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths."
