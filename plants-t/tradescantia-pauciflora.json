    "intro": "Tradescantia pauciflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, linear leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Tradescantia pauciflora is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate waterlogged conditions."
