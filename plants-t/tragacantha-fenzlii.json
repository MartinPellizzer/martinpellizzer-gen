    "intro": "Tragacantha fenzlii, commonly known as the Fenzli tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, inflated pods containing seeds. It is valued for its resinous sap, which has been traditionally used in medicinal and industrial applications. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often found in rocky or sandy soils in its natural habitat."
