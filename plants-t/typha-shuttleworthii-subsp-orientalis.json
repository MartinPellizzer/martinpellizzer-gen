    "intro": "Typha shuttleworthii subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental cattail, is a wetland plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flowering spike that emerges from a thick, mat-like base of narrow leaves. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, lakes, and along riverbanks. Its flowers produce fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
