    "intro": "Tripleurospermum uniglandulosum, commonly known as the single-gland dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and a single, prominent gland on each leaf. The plant produces a single, tall stem with a spherical seed head that disperses seeds via the wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The species is notable for its medicinal uses and its role in supporting pollinators."
