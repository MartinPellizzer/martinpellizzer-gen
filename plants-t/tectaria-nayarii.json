    "intro": "Tectaria nayarii, commonly known as the Yucatan shield fern, is a species of fern native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are leathery and have a rough texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Tectaria nayarii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
