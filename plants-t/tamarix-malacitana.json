    "intro": "Tamarix malacitana, commonly known as the Malagasy tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Tamaricaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces pink or red flowers in spikes, which bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought and poor soil conditions. Tamarix malacitana is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in sandy or coastal areas."
