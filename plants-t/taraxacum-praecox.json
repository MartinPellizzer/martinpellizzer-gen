    "intro": "Taraxacum praecox, commonly known as the early dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a composite flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a dense cluster of disk florets, which develop into the familiar parachute-like seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed soils. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects."
