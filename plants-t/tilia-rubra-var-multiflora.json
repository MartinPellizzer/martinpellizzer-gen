    "intro": "Tilia rubra var. multiflora, commonly known as the red-leaf linden, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn reddish in the fall, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are highly attractive to pollinators. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often developing shallow fissures with age. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
