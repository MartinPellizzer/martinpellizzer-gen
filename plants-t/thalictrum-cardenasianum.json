It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, such as forest understories or stream sides. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain numerous seeds. Thalictrum cardenasianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native ecosystem."
