    "intro": "Thelypteris petelotii, commonly known as the Mexican water fern, is a species of fern native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with small, ovate pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread through the undergrowth. Thelypteris petelotii plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
