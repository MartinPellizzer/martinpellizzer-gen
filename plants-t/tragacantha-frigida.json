    "intro": "Tragacantha frigida, commonly known as the coldtragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. The plant produces yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by distinctive seed pods. Its roots are known to exude a sticky resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine. Tragacantha frigida thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters."
