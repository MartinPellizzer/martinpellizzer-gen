It is a perennial herb with slender, branching stems and small, tubular flowers that are typically red or pink in color. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
