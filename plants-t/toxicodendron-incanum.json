    "intro": "Toxicodendron incanum, commonly known as the sandalwood tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family. It is native to parts of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and smooth, pale bark. The plant is known for its aromatic wood, which has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of incense. However, it can cause skin irritation in some individuals due to the presence of urushiol, a compound found in many members of its family. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
