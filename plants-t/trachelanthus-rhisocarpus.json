    "intro": "Trachelanthus rhisocarpus, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions through its ability to store water in its fleshy leaves and stems. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Trachelanthus rhisocarpus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife."
