    "intro": "Thymus munbyanus, commonly known as Munby's thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats of small, grey-green leaves and produces pink or purple flowers in the spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in limestone habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
