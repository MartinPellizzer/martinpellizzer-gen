    "intro": "Thalictrum filamentosum var. sikokianum, commonly known as the Sikokian meadow rue, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse its seeds. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
