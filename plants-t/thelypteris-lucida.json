    "intro": "Thelypteris lucida, commonly known as the shining shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving them a shiny appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of foliage. Thelypteris lucida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its aesthetic qualities."
