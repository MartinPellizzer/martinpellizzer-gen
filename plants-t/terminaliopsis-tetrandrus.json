    "intro": "Terminaliopsis tetrandrus, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mound-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, often with a contrasting throat. Its leaves are velvety and heart-shaped, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Terminaliopsis tetrandrus thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
