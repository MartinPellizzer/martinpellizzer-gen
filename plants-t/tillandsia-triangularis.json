    "intro": "Tillandsia triangularis, commonly known as the triangle tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup to collect water. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Tillandsia triangularis is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
