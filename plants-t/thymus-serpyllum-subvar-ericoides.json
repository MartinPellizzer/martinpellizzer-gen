    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum subvar. ericoides, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically gray-green in color and emit a strong thyme scent when crushed. The plant produces pink or white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it both a useful ground cover and a valuable addition to herbal gardens."
