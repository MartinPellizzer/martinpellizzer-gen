    "intro": "Triticum sativum subsp. turgidum, commonly known as durum wheat, is a subspecies of wheat native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hard, tough grains that are high in protein and gluten content. This plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has a compact, semi-dwarf growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and its spikes are usually shorter than those of common wheat. The plant produces small, spikelet-like flowers that develop into tough, inedible grains."
