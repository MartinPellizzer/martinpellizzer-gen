It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, purple or pinkish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. This species is valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage crop for livestock."
