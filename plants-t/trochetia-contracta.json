    "intro": "Trochetia contracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant has small, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters, and bloom in early spring. Trochetia contracta is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with limited rainfall."
