    "intro": "Toxicodendron retusum, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are arranged in pairs along the stems, and its clusters of small, yellowish flowers that develop into red, fuzzy fruits. The plant contains urushiol, a potent allergen that causes skin irritation and itching in many individuals. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
