It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
