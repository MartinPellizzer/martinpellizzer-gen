    "intro": "Trimorpha alpina, commonly known as the alpine trimorpha, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a compact growth habit, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous regions. Due to its specialized habitat, Trimorpha alpina is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
