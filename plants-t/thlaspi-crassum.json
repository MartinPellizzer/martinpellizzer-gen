    "intro": "Thlaspi crassum, commonly known as broad-leaved cress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and marshy areas. It produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Thlaspi crassum is a hardy perennial that is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
