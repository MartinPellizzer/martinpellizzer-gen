    "intro": "Tectaria irrigua, commonly known as the water tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Tectaria irrigua is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
