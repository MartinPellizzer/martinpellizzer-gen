    "intro": "Tragacantha fendleri, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and heart-shaped, hairy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its latex-rich sap has been used historically for its medicinal properties and as a natural gum. Tragacantha fendleri plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in desert ecosystems."
