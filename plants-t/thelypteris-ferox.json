    "intro": "Thelypteris ferox, commonly known as the feral holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Thelypteris ferox thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near streams."
