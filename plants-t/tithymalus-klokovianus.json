    "intro": "Tithymalus klokovianus, commonly known as the Klokov's tithymalus, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering plant native to specific regions of Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and flies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Tithymalus klokovianus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
