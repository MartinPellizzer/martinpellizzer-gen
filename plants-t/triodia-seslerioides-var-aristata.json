    "intro": "Triodia seslerioides var. aristata, commonly known as the coastal spinifex grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It features wiry, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or coastal heathlands. Its dense growth habit makes it an important component of stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
