    "intro": "Tillaea prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate tillaea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible or medicinal properties. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its small, clustered flowers are typically pink or purple, appearing in late spring to early summer. Tillaea prostrata is adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
