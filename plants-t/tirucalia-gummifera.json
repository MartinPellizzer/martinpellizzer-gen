It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and long, slender leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody, gummy capsules containing seeds. It is valued for its latex, which has been used traditionally in various medicinal and industrial applications. The tree thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks."
