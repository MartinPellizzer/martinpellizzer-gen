    "intro": "Taraxacum polycercum, commonly known as the clustered dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, tall flowering stem that produces a cluster of small, yellow composite flowers. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. After flowering, it produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. This species is also noted for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies."
