It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive and ecologically valuable plant in native plant landscapes."
