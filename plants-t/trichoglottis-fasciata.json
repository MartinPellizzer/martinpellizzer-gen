    "intro": "Trichoglottis fasciata, commonly known as the banded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive dark green, strap-like leaves and its striking, pale yellow to white flowers with dark purple or brown markings. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and help store water, enabling it to survive in its tropical habitat. Trichoglottis fasciata is a popular species among orchid enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
