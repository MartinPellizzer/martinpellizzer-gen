    "intro": "Thea sinensis var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy tea plant, is a variant of the Camellia sinensis species. It is characterized by its hairy leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance compared to other tea plants. This variety is native to China and is often cultivated for its unique foliage rather than for tea production. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to several meters. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in horticulture and botanical research."
