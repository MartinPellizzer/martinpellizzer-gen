It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant is often found in humid, shaded environments within lowland forests. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not widely cultivated. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its native range."
