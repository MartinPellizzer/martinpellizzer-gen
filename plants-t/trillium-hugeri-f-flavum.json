    "intro": "Trillium hugeri f. flavum, commonly known as the yellow trillium, is a rare and striking perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its three broad, waxy leaves and a single, showy yellow flower that blooms in early spring. The plant typically grows in rich, moist woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, and it produces red or orange berries that are dispersed by birds. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas."
