    "intro": "Tessmannia anomala, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in winter, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Tessmannia anomala is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional Aboriginal crafts."
