    "intro": "Taraxacum pindicola, commonly known as the Pindus dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Greece and Albania. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and a distinctive hollow stem. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which is typical of the genus Taraxacum. It thrives in rocky and calcareous soils, often growing in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
