    "intro": "Thuja occidentalis f. lutea, commonly known as the golden spruce, is a rare and striking variant of the eastern white cedar. This form is characterized by its vibrant golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts sharply with the typical green of the standard species. The leaves are smaller and more densely packed, giving the plant a unique, ornamental appearance. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value and hardy nature. However, it is less common in the wild due to its specific environmental requirements."
