    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 rupicola, commonly known as the hybrid thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and aromatic, small gray-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in gardens for both its fragrance and visual appeal."
