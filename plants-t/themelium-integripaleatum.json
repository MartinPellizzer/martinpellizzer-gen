    "intro": "Themelium integripaleatum, commonly known as the smooth-pale leaf fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 15 to 30 centimeters in length. The plant features a creeping rhizome that produces multiple fronds, which are usually bright green and have a smooth, unbroken surface. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
