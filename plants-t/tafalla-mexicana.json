    "intro": "Tafalla mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican tafalla, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Tafalla mexicana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
