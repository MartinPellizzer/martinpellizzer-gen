    "intro": "Thelypteris firmula, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored dust. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with fertile sori arranged in two rows along the margins of the pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Thelypteris firmula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
