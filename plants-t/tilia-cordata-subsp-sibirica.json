    "intro": "Tilia cordata subsp. sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, grey bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are ovate to heart-shaped, with a serrated margin and a pale underside, and they turn yellow in autumn. It produces small, fragrant yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal, shade-providing canopy, and historical use in traditional medicine."
