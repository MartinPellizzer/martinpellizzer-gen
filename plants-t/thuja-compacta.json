    "intro": "Thuja compacta, commonly known as the Japanese thuja or golden thread, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to Japan. It features a compact, columnar shape with dense, scale-like foliage that is typically a bright yellow-green color. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in flattened sprays, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. It produces tiny, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, adding seasonal interest. Thuja compacta is often used in landscaping for its ability to thrive in shaded areas and its resistance to pests and diseases."
