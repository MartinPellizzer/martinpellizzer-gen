It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces a gum-like substance known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it a hardy perennial in suitable climates. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological and horticultural study."
