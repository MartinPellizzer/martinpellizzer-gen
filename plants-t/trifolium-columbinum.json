    "intro": "Trifolium columbinum, commonly known as the purple clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in early spring. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Trifolium columbinum is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
