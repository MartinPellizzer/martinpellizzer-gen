It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens."
