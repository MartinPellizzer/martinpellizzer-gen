    "intro": "Trochera avenacea, commonly known as the slender spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and unique floral structures. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, preferring moist, acidic soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in cyathia, which are modified leaf-like structures. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in its wetland habitat."
