It features clusters of small, fragrant white or yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red, fuzzy fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly serrated edge. While not highly toxic, it can cause mild skin irritation in some individuals."
