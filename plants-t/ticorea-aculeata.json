    "intro": "Ticorea aculeata, commonly known as the spiny beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and bract-covered stems. The plant features small, yellow to white flowers arranged in clusters, and its stems are often covered with stiff, spiny hairs. Ticorea aculeata is typically found in moist, disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and wetlands. It serves as a host plant for certain Lepidoptera species and is sometimes considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habits."
