    "intro": "Tanacetum tomentellum, commonly known as the woolly tansy, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence covering its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
