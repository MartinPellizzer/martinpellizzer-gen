    "intro": "Trixis hexantha, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has silvery-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its fibrous root system allows it to survive in sandy soils with minimal water. Trixis hexantha plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
