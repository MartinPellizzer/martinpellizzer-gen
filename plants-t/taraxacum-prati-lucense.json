    "intro": "Taraxacum prati-lucense, commonly known as the meadow dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which are typical of the Compositae family. It produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus, which aids in its propagation. This plant is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
