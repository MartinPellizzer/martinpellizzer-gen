    "intro": "Turritis lasiophylla, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Turritis lasiophylla is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain areas."
