    "intro": "Taraxacum taraxacum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which develop into the familiar white, fluffy seed heads. The plant is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings. It has a taproot system and is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
