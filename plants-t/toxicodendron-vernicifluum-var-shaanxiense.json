    "intro": "Toxicodendron vernicifluum var. shaanxiense, commonly known as the Shaanxi lacquer tree, is a variant of the Chinese lacquer tree native to central China. It is characterized by its smooth, glossy leaves and the ability to produce a thick, toxic sap used in traditional lacquerware production. The plant belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is known for its allergenic properties due to the urushiol compound present in its sap. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its toxic nature, handling the plant requires caution to avoid skin irritation and allergic reactions."
