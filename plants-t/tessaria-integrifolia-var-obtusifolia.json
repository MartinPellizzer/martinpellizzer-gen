    "intro": "Tessaria integrifolia var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved tessaria, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height, bearing lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in loose panicles, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically entire, though the variety obtusifolia has rounded leaf tips, distinguishing it from other varieties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats."
