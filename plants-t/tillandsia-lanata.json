    "intro": "Tillandsia lanata, commonly known as the woolly air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white trichomes that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often attaching itself to trees in humid environments. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, arranged in a rosette pattern to collect moisture and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia lanata is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
