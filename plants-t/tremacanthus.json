    "intro": "Tremacanthus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and broad, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers are typically pink or red and bloom in the summer. Tremacanthus is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species."
