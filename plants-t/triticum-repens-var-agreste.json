    "intro": "Triticum repens var. agreste, commonly known as creeping wheat, is a grass species characterized by its prostrate growth habit and slender, jointed stems. It produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences with awned lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family. The plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. This variety is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid spread and resilience."
