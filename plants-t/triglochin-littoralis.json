    "intro": "Triglochin littoralis, commonly known as salt marsh grass or sea grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, often found in estuaries and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its small, greenish flowers appear in clusters and are adapted to wind pollination. Triglochin littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
