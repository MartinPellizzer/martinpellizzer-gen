    "intro": "Thalia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf thalia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in summer and attract various pollinators. Thalia angustifolia plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
