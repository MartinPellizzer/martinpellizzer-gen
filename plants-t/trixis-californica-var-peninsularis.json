    "intro": "Trixis californica var. peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular trixis, is a perennial herb native to coastal areas of southern California. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal scrub and dunes. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
