    "intro": "Tillandsia buchtienii, commonly known as the Buchtien's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, fibrous roots and rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. These trichomes help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
