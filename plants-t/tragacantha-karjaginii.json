    "intro": "Tragacantha karjaginii, commonly known as the Karjagin tragakang, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stem and bipinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
