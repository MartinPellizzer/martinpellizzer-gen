    "intro": "Tillandsia macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that can be white, pink, or purple, adding ornamental value. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is popular as a decorative plant in both indoor and outdoor settings."
