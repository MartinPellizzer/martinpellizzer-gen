    "intro": "Trichilia australis, commonly known as the Australian tallowwood, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its wood is heavy, durable, and highly valued for construction and furniture-making. Trichilia australis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
