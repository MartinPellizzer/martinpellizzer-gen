    "intro": "Thelypteris sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish or blackish hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves."
