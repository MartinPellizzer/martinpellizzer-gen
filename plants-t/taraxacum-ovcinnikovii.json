    "intro": "Taraxacum ovcinnikovii, commonly known as the Ovcinnikov's dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, typical of the Compositae family. It produces a distinctive seed head with pappus-equipped seeds that are easily dispersed by wind. This species is native to specific regions in Central Asia and is often found in dry, rocky or sandy soils."
