    "intro": "Trifolium gemellum var. pedunculatum, commonly known as the slender clover, is a flowering plant species belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. This variety is native to parts of Europe and Asia and thrives in temperate climates. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in traditional herbal medicine."
