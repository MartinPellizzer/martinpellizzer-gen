    "intro": "Trifolium cylindricum, commonly known as the cylindrical clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in grassy areas and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Trifolium cylindricum is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it an important plant for soil enrichment."
