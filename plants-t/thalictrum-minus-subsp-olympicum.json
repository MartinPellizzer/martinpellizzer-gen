    "intro": "Thalictrum minus subsp. olympicum, commonly known as the Olympic meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern around the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, often drooping peduncles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
