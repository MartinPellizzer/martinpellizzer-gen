    "intro": "Thelypteris paleata, commonly known as the pale fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green to pale yellow in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across the soil surface. Thelypteris paleata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
