    "intro": "Tieghemopanax dioicus, commonly known as the diocious arrowleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically bisexual but can be unisexual in some cases. It is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
