    "intro": "Triticum durum var. nosatovskii, commonly known as a wild wheat species, is a grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hardy, drought-resistant nature and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its seeds are encased in tough hulls, which make them difficult to process but well-suited for traditional milling methods. This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to harsh environments."
