    "intro": "Thalictrum kamtschaticum, commonly known as the Kamtschaticum meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe and Western Siberia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with a slender stem and a preference for moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and subtle floral display."
