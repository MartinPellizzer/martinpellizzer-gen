It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are hairy and often have a bluish-green hue. Its bright yellow flower heads consist of numerous small florets that mature into fluffy white seeds with parachute-like structures. It thrives in moist, open habitats and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils."
