    "intro": "Trientalis borealis f. tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender starflower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in open, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in tundra or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized plant."
