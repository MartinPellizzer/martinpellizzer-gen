    "intro": "Tachigali urbaniana, commonly known as the Brazilian tachigali, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the branches. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody pods containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
