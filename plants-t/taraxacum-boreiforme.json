    "intro": "Taraxacum boreiforme, commonly known as the Arctic dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that are adapted to cold climates. The plant produces a single, hollow, yellow flower stem that bears a composite flower head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its flowers are followed by a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head, or pappus, which aids in its propagation in open, barren environments. Taraxacum boreiforme is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited to survive in harsh, high-latitude conditions."
