    "intro": "Thelypteris motleyana, commonly known as Motley's sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous strobiliferous sporangia on the undersides of the fronds. Thelypteris motleyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
