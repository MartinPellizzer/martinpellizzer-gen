It thrives in saline or brackish wetlands, showcasing its adaptability to harsh, waterlogged environments. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are succulent and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Turritis salsuginosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting biodiversity in tidal zones."
