    "intro": "Taraxacum praelongum, commonly known as the long-stemmed dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, showy yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, spherical seed head composed of numerous tiny seeds attached to parachute-like structures, facilitating wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and garden beds. Taraxacum praelongum is adapted to temperate climates and is known for its resilience and ability to colonize various habitats."
