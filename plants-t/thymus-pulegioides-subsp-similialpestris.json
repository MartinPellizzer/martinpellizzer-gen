    "intro": "Thymus pulegioides subsp. similialpestris, commonly known as alpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features aromatic, gray-green leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh alpine environment. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. This subspecies is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
