It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a gum resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a thickening agent. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture. Tragacantha longiramosa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments."
