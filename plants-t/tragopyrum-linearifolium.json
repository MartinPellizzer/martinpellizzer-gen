    "intro": "Tragopyrum linearifolium, commonly known as the slender wild millet, is a herbaceous annual plant native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Tragopyrum linearifolium is primarily valued for its role in ecological systems rather than for agricultural or ornamental purposes."
