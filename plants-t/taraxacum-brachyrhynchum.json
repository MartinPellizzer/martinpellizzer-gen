    "intro": "Taraxacum brachyrhynchum, commonly known as the short-styled dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a single, yellow flower head that develops into a white, spherical pappus for wind dispersal. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It produces a milky sap that contains latex, which is typical of the genus Taraxacum. This species is similar to other dandelions but can be distinguished by its shorter style and narrower leaves."
