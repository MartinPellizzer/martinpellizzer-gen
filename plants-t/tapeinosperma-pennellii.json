It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous structure and often nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody pod, typical of many legumes.
