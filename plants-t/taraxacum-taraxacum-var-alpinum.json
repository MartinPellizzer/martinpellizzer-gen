    "intro": "Taraxacum taraxacum var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes. It has a robust root system that allows it to survive in harsh, cold environments. The species is notable for its ability to bloom early in the growing season, making it an important early indicator plant in alpine ecosystems."
