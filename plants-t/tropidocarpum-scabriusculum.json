It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many species with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and specialized species."
