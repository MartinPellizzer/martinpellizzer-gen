    "intro": "Trigonobalanus excelsa, commonly known as the giant ironwood tree, is a tall, evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed, which is encased in a hard, woody shell. It is well adapted to coastal and swampy habitats, often forming dense stands in mangrove ecosystems. Due to its durable wood and ecological importance, it plays a significant role in both local biodiversity and traditional uses."
