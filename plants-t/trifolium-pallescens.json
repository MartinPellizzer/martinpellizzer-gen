    "intro": "Trifolium pallescens, commonly known as the pale clover, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. Trifolium pallescens is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
