    "intro": "Trifolium brachypus, commonly known as the short-stemmed clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant features trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or white. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Trifolium brachypus is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for agricultural and ecological systems."
