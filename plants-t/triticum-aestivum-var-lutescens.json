    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. lutescens, commonly known as golden wheat, is a variant of wheat characterized by its distinctive golden hue in the grains. This variety is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than high yield, often used in ornamental gardening and specialty food products. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stalks and awned glumes. Its botanical features include a complex inflorescence with spikelets and florets that mature into golden grains. The variety is also valued for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in temperate climates."
