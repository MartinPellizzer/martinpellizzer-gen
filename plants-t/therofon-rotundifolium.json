    "intro": "Therofon rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leafed therofon, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive round, broad leaves. It belongs to the family Therofonaceae and is native to the arid regions of southern Africa. The plant exhibits a low-growing, succulent structure, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying shades of yellow and orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Therofon rotundifolium is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
