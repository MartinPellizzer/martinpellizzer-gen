It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically gray-green in color, and it produces clusters of tiny white flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit and aromatic foliage, which contains essential oils responsible for its distinctive scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Thymus leucadicus is also valued for its medicinal properties and historical use in herbal remedies."
