It is a perennial shrub characterized by its glandular-pubescent stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its tuberous roots are an adaptation for storing nutrients and water, aiding survival in dry environments. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils."
