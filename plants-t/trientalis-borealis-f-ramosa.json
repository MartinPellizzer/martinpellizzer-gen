    "intro": "Trientalis borealis f. ramosa, commonly known as the branching starflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clustered foliage. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are often accompanied by hairy stems and leaves. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in open woods or along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable component of boreal and subarctic ecosystems."
