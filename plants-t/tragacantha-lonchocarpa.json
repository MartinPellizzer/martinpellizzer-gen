    "intro": "Tragacantha lonchocarpa, commonly known as the Persian gum or Aleppo gum, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces distinctive yellow flowers and is known for its valuable resin, which has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are trifoliate, and the fruit is a legume that splits open to release seeds. The plant's ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of its native ecosystems."
