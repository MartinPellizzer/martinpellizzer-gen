It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is divided into three distinct lobes. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats."
