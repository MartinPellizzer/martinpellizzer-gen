    "intro": "Tereietra, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and stems adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Tereietra is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its resilience and beauty."
