    "intro": "Tectaria milnei, commonly known as the Milne's tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bioluminescent, a feature that distinguishes it from many other fern species. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are released in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the undersides of its leaves. Tectaria milnei plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
