    "intro": "Typha changbaiensis, commonly known as the Changbai reed, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Changbai Mountains in China. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense stands. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in wetland environments and is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered an important species for ecological studies and conservation efforts."
