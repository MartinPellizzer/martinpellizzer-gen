    "intro": "Trachypetalum longirostre, commonly known as the long-beaked trachypetalum, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its unique floral morphology. The plant exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are notable for their elongated, tubular corolla, which is adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
