    "intro": "Theresia tulipilfoia, commonly known as the pink-flowered fern, is a unique plant characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features small, clustered pink flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical greenhouses."
