    "intro": "Tetracme recurvata, commonly known as the zigzag tetracme, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or white, and it has trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets. Tetracme recurvata is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in partial shade, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land management."
