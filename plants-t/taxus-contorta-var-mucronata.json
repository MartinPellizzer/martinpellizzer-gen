    "intro": "Taxus contorta var. mucronata, commonly known as the Pacific yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, twisted branches and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally along the stems. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife species. Its bark and branches contain taxine alkaloids, which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its unique appearance."
