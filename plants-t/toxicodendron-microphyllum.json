    "intro": "Toxicodendron microphyllum, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown stems that resemble antlers, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are compound, with elongated leaflets that turn bright red in the fall. However, it contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation in humans."
