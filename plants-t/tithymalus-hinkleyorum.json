    "intro": "Tithymalus hinkleyorum, commonly known as Hinkley's tithymalus, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific alpine environments. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant has a compact growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it survive in cold, high-altitude conditions. It is typically found in rocky soils and requires well-drained, nutrient-poor habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological needs, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
