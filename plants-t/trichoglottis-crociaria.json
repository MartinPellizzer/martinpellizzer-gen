    "intro": "Trichoglottis crociaria, commonly known as the crocus orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually yellow or greenish-yellow in color, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil, while its leaves are strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette. Trichoglottis crociaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
