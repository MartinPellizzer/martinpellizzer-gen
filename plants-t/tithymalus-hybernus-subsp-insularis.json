    "intro": "Tithymalus hybernus subsp. insularis, commonly known as the Isle of Man tithymalus, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on the Isle of Man. It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in coastal or near-coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect its fragile ecosystem and ensure its survival."
