    "intro": "Tulipa australis subsp. gallica, commonly known as the Gallic tulip, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a parent species in the development of many modern tulip cultivars."
