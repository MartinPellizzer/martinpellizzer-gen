    "intro": "Turbinicarpus saueri subsp. knuthianus, commonly known as the Knuth's turbinicarpus, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a globular stem with a ribbed structure and is covered in dense, white to yellowish spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
