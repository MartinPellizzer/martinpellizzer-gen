    "intro": "Taraxacum acutulum, commonly known as the lesser dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a parachute-like structure called a pappus. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, roadsides, and meadows. Botanically, it is a member of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties."
