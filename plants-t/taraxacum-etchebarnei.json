It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other composite flowers. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a crown of white, fluffy seeds. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often found in open, sunny habitats at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
