    "intro": "Trimezia spathata subsp. spathata, commonly known as the Hawaiian mountain ginger, is a perennial herb native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to its appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in shaded to partially shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
