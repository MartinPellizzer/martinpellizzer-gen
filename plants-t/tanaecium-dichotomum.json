    "intro": "Tanaecium dichotomum, commonly known as the dichotomous tanaecium, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem with branching that occurs at the nodes, giving it a distinctive dichotomous growth pattern. Tanaecium dichotomum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
