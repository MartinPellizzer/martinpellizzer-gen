    "intro": "Tephrosia brummittii, commonly known as the purple tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found in dry, open habitats and can thrive in poor soil conditions due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Tephrosia brummittii is also noted for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
