    "intro": "Tillandsia fasciculata var. convexispica, commonly known as the convex-spiked air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. Its inflorescence produces small, colorful flowers that range from white to red, depending on the variety. This air plant thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
