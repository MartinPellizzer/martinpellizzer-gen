    "intro": "Trichocereus orurensis, commonly known as the Bolivian torch cactus, is a species native to the Andes mountains of Bolivia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its spineless stems and thick, fleshy texture allow it to store water efficiently in its arid environment. Trichocereus orurensis is often cultivated for its striking appearance and is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
