    "intro": "Thelypteris gracilescens, commonly known as the slender holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. Thelypteris gracilescens thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the forest floor."
