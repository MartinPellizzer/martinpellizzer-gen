    "intro": "Taraxacum samuelssonii, commonly known as Samuelsson's dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in grassland and rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. Its yellow flower head consists of numerous ray florets that open in the daytime and close at night. Samuelsson's dandelion is adapted to dry conditions and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
