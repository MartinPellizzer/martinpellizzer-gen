    "intro": "Tidestromia tenella, commonly known as the narrowleaf tidestromia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a herbaceous annual that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Tidestromia tenella is adapted to salt spray and can withstand mild coastal winds, making it a characteristic species of maritime environments."
