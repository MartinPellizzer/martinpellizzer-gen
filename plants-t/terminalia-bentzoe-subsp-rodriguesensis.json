    "intro": "Terminalia bentzoe subsp. rodriguesensis, commonly known as Rodrigues ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its thick, dark bark and dense, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in traditional construction and as a source of tannins. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered threatened in its natural range."
