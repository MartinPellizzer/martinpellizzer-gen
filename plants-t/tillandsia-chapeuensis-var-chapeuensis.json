    "intro": "Tillandsia chapeuensis var. chapeuensis, commonly known as the Chapeuense air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal direct sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
