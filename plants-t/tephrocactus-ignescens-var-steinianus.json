    "intro": "Tephrocactus ignescens var. steinianus, commonly known as the fiery cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, bright red to orange spines and its ability to produce vibrant, tubular flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has a compact, globular shape with a ribbed stem that helps it store water efficiently in its native desert environment. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. The botanical features of this cactus make it well adapted to extreme heat and drought, showcasing its resilience in harsh conditions."
