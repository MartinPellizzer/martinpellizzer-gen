    "intro": "Tsjeru-caniram parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leafed forest fern, is a species native to the dense, humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sorocarps, which are clustered at the base of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing along the forest floor. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
