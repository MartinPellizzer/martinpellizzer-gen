    "intro": "Taraxacum brachyglossum f. aphanochroum, commonly known as the pale-leaved dandelion, is a botanical variant of the dandelion species characterized by its reduced leaf size and lighter green coloration. It is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family, known for its yellow composite flowers and milky sap. The leaves are typically shorter and more densely packed compared to the standard species, giving it a compact appearance. This form is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in temperate climates. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in studies related to plant morphology and ecological adaptation."
