    "intro": "Tambourissa tau, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a dense crown. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a glossy surface, while the flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Due to its slow growth and high demand, Tambourissa tau is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its native range."
