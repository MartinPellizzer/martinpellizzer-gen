    "intro": "Trigonella monspeliaca f. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded fenugreek, is a variant of the fenugreek plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with a strong aroma. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by inflated pods containing numerous elliptical seeds. Its seeds are larger than those of the typical fenugreek, making them more prominent in both appearance and culinary use. This form is often cultivated for its aromatic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and cooking."
