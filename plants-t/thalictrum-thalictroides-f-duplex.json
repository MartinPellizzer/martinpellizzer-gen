This plant features showy, yellowish-green flowers arranged in compound umbels, which are typically borne on tall, slender stems. The leaves are finely divided and feather-like, contributing to the plant's delicate appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. The 'duplex' form is notable for its unique floral morphology, which sets it apart from other members of the Thalictrum species."
