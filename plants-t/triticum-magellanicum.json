    "intro": "Triticum magellanicum, commonly known as the Magellanic wheat, is a wild relative of modern wheat native to South America. It is a grass species characterized by its slender stalks and spikelets, which contain small, awned grains. This plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, often found in the Andes Mountains. Its genome contains valuable genetic diversity that can be used in breeding programs to improve wheat resilience. Triticum magellanicum plays an important role in agricultural research due to its potential for enhancing crop yield and stress tolerance."
