It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and is known for its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Trichocline eriopus is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
