    "intro": "Thelypteris decussata f. velutina, commonly known as the velvety shield fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds and reproductive structures. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a velvety texture due to the dense arrangement of trichomes on the underside. The sori, which contain the spores, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
