    "intro": "Trillium atropurpureum, commonly known as purple trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Melanthiaceae family and is characterized by its three elliptical leaves and a single, showy purple flower with three petals. The plant typically grows in rich, moist woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade. It produces a cluster of three leaf-like bracts that surround the flower, which blooms in early spring. Trillium atropurpureum is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades."
