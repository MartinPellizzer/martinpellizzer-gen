    "intro": "Trichomanes brasiliense, commonly known as the Brazilian maidenhair fern, is a member of the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes brasiliense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
