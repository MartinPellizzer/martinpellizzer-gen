    "intro": "Tium palans, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange flowers that resemble flames, which bloom in clusters during the warm season. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. It thrives in humid, well-drained soil and requires indirect sunlight to prevent leaf burn. Tium palans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a popular choice in botanical gardens and private collections."
