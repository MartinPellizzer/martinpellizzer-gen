    "intro": "Trymalium odoratissimum, commonly known as the sweet-scented mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in Australia. It has small, leathery leaves and produces clusters of white, fleshy flowers that emit a strong, sweet fragrance. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, round berries that are dispersed by birds. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat."
