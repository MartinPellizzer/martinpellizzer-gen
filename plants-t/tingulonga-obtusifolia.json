    "intro": "Tingulonga obtusifolia, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by follicles containing seeds with silky pappi for wind dispersal. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of local ecosystems. The plant contains latex, which can be toxic if ingested, and is often used in traditional medicine."
