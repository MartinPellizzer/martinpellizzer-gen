    "intro": "Telipogon aureus, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers with a star-like pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telipogon aureus is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
