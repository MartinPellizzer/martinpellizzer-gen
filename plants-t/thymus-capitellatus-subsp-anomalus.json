    "intro": "Thymus capitellatus subsp. anomalus, commonly known as the alpine thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, aromatic leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its foliage is often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its essential oils and antioxidant properties. This subspecies is closely related to other thyme species but is distinguished by its unique floral structure and habitat preferences."
