    "intro": "Trichosma neglectum, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are dark blue to black in color and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Trichosma neglectum is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forested areas where it thrives as a partial parasite."
