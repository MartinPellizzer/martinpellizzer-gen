    "intro": "Tephrosia virginiana, commonly known as wild senna, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Tephrosia virginiana is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
