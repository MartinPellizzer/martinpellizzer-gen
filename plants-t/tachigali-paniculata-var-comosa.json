It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
