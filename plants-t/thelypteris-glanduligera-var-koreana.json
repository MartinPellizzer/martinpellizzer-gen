    "intro": "Thelypteris glanduligera var. koreana, commonly known as the Korean water fern, is a perennial fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or ascending. The plant produces small, clustered sori on the underside of its leaves, which are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for aquatic and bog gardens."
