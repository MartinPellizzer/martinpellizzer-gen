It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in a distinctive white, powdery coating. The leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly curled or rolled appearance, giving them a grass-like appearance. It produces small, yellowish flowers in dense clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. This plant is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in disturbed or open habitats."
