    "intro": "Tillandsia carinata var. constricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, bright but indirect light conditions and requires regular misting or soaking to maintain its health. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
