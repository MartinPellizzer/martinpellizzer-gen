    "intro": "Telina capnitidis, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features basal leaves that are usually succulent and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its showy yellow flowers are borne in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Telina capnitidis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and aesthetic value."
