    "intro": "Tillandsia peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with colorful, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Tillandsia peruviana is well adapted to its high-altitude, arid environment and requires bright, indirect light and moderate watering."
