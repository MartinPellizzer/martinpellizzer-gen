    "intro": "Typhonium circinnatum, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with purple veins, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in suitable habitats."
