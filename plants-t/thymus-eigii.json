    "intro": "Thymus eigii, commonly known as the Eigg thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Scottish island of Eigg. It is characterized by its small, fragrant leaves and pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and coastal environments. Its aromatic oils, rich in thymol, make it valuable for both culinary and medicinal uses. Thymus eigii is also noted for its resilience to harsh weather conditions, making it a hardy species in the wild."
