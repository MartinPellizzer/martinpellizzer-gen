    "intro": "Thelypteris flavovirens, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often tinged with yellow or golden hues, especially along the margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are covered in a fine, hairy layer. The fern's unique coloration and structure make it a visually striking addition to botanical collections and natural habitats."
