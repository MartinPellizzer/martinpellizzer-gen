    "intro": "Tripidium strictum, commonly known as the rigid tripidium, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
