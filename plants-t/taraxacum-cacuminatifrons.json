It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single, elongated flower stem topped with a spherical cluster of seeds. The plant is characterized by its yellow composite flower head, which develops into a pappus-equipped seed head for wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sunny habitats. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Asteraceae family."
