    "intro": "Thelypteris spinosa, commonly known as the spinous wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often adorned with small, spiny structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris spinosa plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
