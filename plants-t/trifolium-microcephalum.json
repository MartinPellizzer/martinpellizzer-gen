    "intro": "Trifolium microcephalum, commonly known as the small-headed clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Trifolium microcephalum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
