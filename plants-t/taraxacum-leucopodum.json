    "intro": "Taraxacum leucopodum, commonly known as the white-lobed dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves that form a tight cluster near the ground. The plant produces a single, tall, hollow stem that bears a flower head composed of bright yellow ray florets. Its flowers develop into fluffy white pappus-based seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. This species is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates."
