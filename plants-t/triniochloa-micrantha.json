    "intro": "Triniochloa micrantha, commonly known as the small-fruit grass, is a species of grass native to certain regions of South America. It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats. Its botanical features include slender stems and tiny, two-lobed flowers that bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
