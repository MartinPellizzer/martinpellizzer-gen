    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum subsp. parviflorus, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically gray-green in color and emit a strong, minty aroma. The plant produces tiny, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary uses, though its medicinal properties are less well-documented compared to other thyme varieties."
