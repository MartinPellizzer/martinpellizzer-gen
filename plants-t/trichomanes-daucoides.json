    "intro": "Trichomanes daucoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or in crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes daucoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
