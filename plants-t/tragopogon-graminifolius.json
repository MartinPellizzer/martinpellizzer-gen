It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, giving it the species name \"graminifolius,\" which translates to \"grass-like leaves.\" The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, seed-filled bracts, aiding in wind dispersal of its seeds."
