    "intro": "Timouria mongolica, commonly known as the Mongolian timouria, is a perennial herb native to the steppes of Mongolia and adjacent regions. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can penetrate deep into the soil, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Timouria mongolica is often found in open grasslands and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
