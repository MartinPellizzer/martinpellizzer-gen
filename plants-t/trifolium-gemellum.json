    "intro": "Trifolium gemellum, commonly known as the twinleaf clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. Trifolium gemellum is native to parts of Europe and is often found in grassy areas and along woodland edges. It is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil and supports sustainable agricultural practices."
