    "intro": "Tapirira velutinifolia, commonly known as the velvet-leaf tapirira, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a velvety texture, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within rainforests. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in panicles, and it produces small, dry fruits. Tapirira velutinifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
