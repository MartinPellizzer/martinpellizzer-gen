    "intro": "Tectaria hippocrepis, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its leaves are usually leathery and have a rugged texture, which helps it retain water in humid conditions. Tectaria hippocrepis plays a role in the ecosystem by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to forest biodiversity."
