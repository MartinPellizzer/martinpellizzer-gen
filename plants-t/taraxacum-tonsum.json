    "intro": "Taraxacum tonsum, commonly known as the Tibetan dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant produces yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, typical of the genus Taraxacum. It thrives in cool, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its leaves are generally hairy and form a rosette, aiding in water retention and protection from strong winds."
