    "intro": "Tricerma viscifolium, commonly known as the sticky-leaf tricerma, is a perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape and have a distinctive sticky texture due to the presence of glandular hairs. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
