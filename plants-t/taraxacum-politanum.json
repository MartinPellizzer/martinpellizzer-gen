It is characterized by its basal rosette of deeply lobed, hairy leaves and a yellow-orange composite flower head. Native to Central Asia, this plant thrives in dry, rocky, or sandy soils. The flowers produce small, wind-dispersed seeds, typical of the genus Taraxacum. It is often found in alpine and steppe regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
