    "intro": "Triticum litorale, commonly known as sea barley, is a wild grass species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to maritime environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces wind-pollinated flowers. Triticum litorale is often found in dune systems and is considered an indicator species for coastal ecosystems."
