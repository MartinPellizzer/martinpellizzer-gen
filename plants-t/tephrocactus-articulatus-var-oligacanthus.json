    "intro": "Tephrocactus articulatus var. oligacanthus, commonly known as the narrow-spined hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, branched cactus with cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Its adaptations include thick, fleshy stems for water storage and reduced leaves to minimize water loss. This variety is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in rock gardens and arid landscapes."
