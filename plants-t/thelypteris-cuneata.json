    "intro": "Thelypteris cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Thelypteris cuneata plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms."
