    "intro": "Tragopogon roseus, commonly known as the roseleaf thistle, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple, and it produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Tragopogon roseus is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it can become invasive in some regions."
