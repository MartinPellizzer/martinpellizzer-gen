    "intro": "Tetraphyle multiceps, commonly known as the four-leaf clover plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Violaceae. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that often display a rare four-leaf mutation. The plant produces clusters of delicate, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its rarity and symbolic significance, it is a popular subject in folklore and botany."
