It features compact, woody stems covered in small, fragrant, purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant's leaves are narrow, slightly hairy, and emit a strong, aromatic scent when crushed. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary uses, particularly in herbal teas and seasoning."
