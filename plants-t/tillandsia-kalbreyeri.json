    "intro": "Tillandsia kalbreyeri, commonly known as the Kalbreyer's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, compact rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, white trichomes. These trichomes help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with violet or pink flowers, adding ornamental value to its appearance."
