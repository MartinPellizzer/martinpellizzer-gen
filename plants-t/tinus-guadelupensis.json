    "intro": "Tinus guadelupensis, commonly known as the Guadeloupe tinus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Guadeloupe in the Caribbean. It is a shrub characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and rocky soils, adapting to the harsh maritime climate. Its flowering period occurs during the dry season, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
