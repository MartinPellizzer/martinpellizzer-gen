    "intro": "Tillandsia gilliesii subsp. gilliesii, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has elongated, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
