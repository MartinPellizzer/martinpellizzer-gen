    "intro": "Tunas polyacantha, commonly known as the thorned milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Tunas polyacantha is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor, well-drained conditions."
