    "intro": "Trichomanes maritimum, commonly known as sea hawksbeard, is a rare and specialized fern that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant is adapted to tolerate salt spray and sandy soils, making it a hardy species found in maritime regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes maritimum plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
