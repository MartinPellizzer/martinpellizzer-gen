It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. Toluifera pubescens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
