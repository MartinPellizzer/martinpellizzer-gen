    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. erinaceum, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild cereal grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and distinctive hairy leaves that give it a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous bracts, which contain the edible grains. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Despite its wild nature, it has been historically used in traditional agriculture and as a forage crop."
