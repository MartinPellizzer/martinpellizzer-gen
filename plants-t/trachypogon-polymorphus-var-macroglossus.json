It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often tinged with silver. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed sites. Its ornamental value is sometimes appreciated in gardens for its delicate, feathery appearance."
