    "intro": "Tacsonia mixta subsp. quitensis, commonly known as the Andean tacsonia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
