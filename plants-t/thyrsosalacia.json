    "intro": "Thyrsosalacia, commonly known as the flamecup, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and parts of Asia, where it thrives in humid, warm climates. The plant is characterized by its showy, orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a torch, hence its common name. Thyrsosalacia species are typically shrubs or small trees, with palmate leaves and hairy stems. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant floral displays."
