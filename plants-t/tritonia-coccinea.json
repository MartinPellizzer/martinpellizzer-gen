    "intro": "Tritonia coccinea, commonly known as the red tritonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant features strap-shaped leaves that are often a deep green, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in suitable conditions. Tritonia coccinea thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking vibrant, colorful blooms. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in many parts of the world beyond its native range."
