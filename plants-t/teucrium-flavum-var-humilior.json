It typically features slender, branched stems covered in fine, grayish-green foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.
