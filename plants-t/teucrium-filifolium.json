    "intro": "Teucrium filifolium, commonly known as slender germander, is a flowering plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, giving it a grass-like appearance, and it is often used in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits. Teucrium filifolium is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry conditions."
