    "intro": "Theodorea salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leafed theodorea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of willow trees, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in late spring. It is native to certain regions of South America and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Theodorea salicifolia is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits."
