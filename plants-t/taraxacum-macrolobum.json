    "intro": "Taraxacum macrolobum, commonly known as the giant dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem that bears a bright yellow composite flower head. After flowering, it develops a distinctive white, puffed seed head that aids in wind dispersal. Its botanical features make it a notable species within the Asteraceae family."
