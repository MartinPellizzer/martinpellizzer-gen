    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 officinarum, commonly known as the small-leaf linden, is a hybrid deciduous tree belonging to the Tiliaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically smaller than those of its parent species, Tilia cordata and Tilia europaea. The tree produces fragrant, pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels and attract pollinators such as bees. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The plant is also valued for its timber, which is lightweight and used in furniture and musical instruments."
