    "intro": "Trichomanes brachypus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, linear leaves that are often described as resembling hair. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves. Trichomanes brachypus is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
