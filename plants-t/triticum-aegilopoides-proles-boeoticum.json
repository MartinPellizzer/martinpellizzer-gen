    "intro": "Triticum aegilopoides proles boeoticum, commonly known as Boeotian grass or Boeotian wild rye, is a wild relative of wheat native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its genetic proximity to cultivated wheat, it is of interest in plant breeding for improving wheat resilience and yield."
