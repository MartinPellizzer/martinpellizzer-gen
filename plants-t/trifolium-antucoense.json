It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and open areas with well-drained soil. Trifolium antucoense is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its potential use in sustainable agriculture."
