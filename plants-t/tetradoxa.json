    "intro": "Tetradoxa, commonly known as the \"screwbean,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral-shaped pods, which give the plant its common name. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. Tetradoxa species are native to various parts of Africa and are often found in dry, rocky habitats. The genus is notable for its unique morphology and is of interest in botanical studies due to its adaptive features."
