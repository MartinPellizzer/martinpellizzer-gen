    "intro": "Tofieldia sphaerocephala, commonly known as the globular sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and is often found in the understory of hardwood forests. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively. Tofieldia sphaerocephala is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in moist garden settings."
