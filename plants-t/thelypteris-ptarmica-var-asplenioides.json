    "intro": "Thelypteris ptarmica var. asplenioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern family (Thelypteridaceae). It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes often covered in a dense layer of brownish, hairy scales. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves."
