    "intro": "Thelymitra cyanapicata, commonly known as the blue-tongued orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It features a compact, low-growing rosette of grass-like leaves and produces striking, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforest understories. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal. Thelymitra cyanapicata is also noted for its ability to form dense clumps over time, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
