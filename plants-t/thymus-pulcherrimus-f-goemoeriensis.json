    "intro": "Thymus pulcherrimus f. goemoeriensis, commonly known as the Goemoer's beauty thyme, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features aromatic, narrow-lanceolate leaves covered in fine, white pubescence, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in dense clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and prefers full sun exposure. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
