    "intro": "Tetrapterys nitida var. ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaf sandmat, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, branched stems that often root at the nodes, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, silky hairs. The small, pale yellow flowers are clustered in terminal spikes and bloom during the spring and early summer. This plant is well adapted to dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in sandy or rocky soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
