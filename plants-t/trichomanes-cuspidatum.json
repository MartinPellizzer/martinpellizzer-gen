    "intro": "Trichomanes cuspidatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf moonwort, is a small fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Trichomanes cuspidatum is often epiphytic, growing on the surfaces of trees or rocks in humid climates."
