    "intro": "Thymus pectinatus, commonly known as the woolly thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming from spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, making it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications. Thymus pectinatus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or limestone habitats."
