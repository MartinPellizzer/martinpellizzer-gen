    "intro": "Taraxacum ardisodon, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive foliage. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white down. Its flowers are yellow and form a single composite head, which develops into a fluffy seed head known as a pappus. Taraxacum ardisodon is adapted to cold, alpine environments and is often found in rocky or grassy habitats at high elevations."
