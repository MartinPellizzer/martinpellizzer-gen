    "intro": "Teagueia teaguei, commonly known as the Teague's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Teagueia teaguei is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to thrive. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
