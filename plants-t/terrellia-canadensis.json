    "intro": "Terrellia canadensis, commonly known as the Canadian terrellia, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Terrellia canadensis thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
