    "intro": "Triglossum, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family. It consists of about 20 species, most of which are found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are typically small, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, erect flower spike. They are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, and they rely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Triglossum species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions."
