It is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States, characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight waxy coating.

The plant is also noted for its ability to spread through runners, which can make it both ornamental and somewhat invasive if not managed properly."
