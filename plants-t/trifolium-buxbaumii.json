    "intro": "Trifolium buxbaumii, commonly known as Buxbaum's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. It produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in spring. Buxbaum's clover is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria."
