    "intro": "Taraxacum acrolobum, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the dandelion genus, characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flower head. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into fluffy white seeds, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
