The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in low-light conditions. Its leaves are slender and often covered in a fine, silken coating, which gives it its common name. Taeckholmia filifolia is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
