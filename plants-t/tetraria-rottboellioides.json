    "intro": "Tetraria rottboellioides, commonly known as the yellow lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form and a yellowish to orange-brown coloration. The thallus is typically foliose or crustose, and it often forms colonies on bark, stones, or soil surfaces. It is widely distributed in temperate regions and is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. This lichen is of interest in ecological studies due to its role as an indicator species for air quality."
