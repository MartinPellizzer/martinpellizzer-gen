    "intro": "Taraxacum caulescens, commonly known as the hairy dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a yellow flower that develops into a fluffy seed head with parachute-like seeds for wind dispersal. It is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, often in temperate regions. Taraxacum caulescens is a perennial herb that is sometimes considered a weed but has ecological and medicinal significance."
