    "intro": "Tibetiodes tsarungensis, commonly known as the Tsarung Tibetan bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to the extreme conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, and it produces small, elongated fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
