    "intro": "Trisetaria, commonly known as the hairless grass or false brome, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. It consists of several species that are typically found in temperate regions, often in open habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils. The plants are characterized by their slender stems, narrow leaves, and small, spike-like inflorescences. They are often used in ecological restoration due to their ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity. Trisetaria species are generally perennial and have a clumping growth habit."
