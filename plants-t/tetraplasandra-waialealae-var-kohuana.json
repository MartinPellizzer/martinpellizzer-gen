    "intro": "Tetraplasandra waialealae var. kohuana, commonly known as the Kauai hibiscus, is a rare endemic plant native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests. The plant features lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a glossy surface and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange. It is closely related to other species in the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
