    "intro": "Tournefortia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaved tournefortia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas and mangrove swamps. The plant has simple, opposite, and often sessile leaves that are usually leathery in texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and have five petals, often in shades of white or yellow. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in coastal ecosystems."
