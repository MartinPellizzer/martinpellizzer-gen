    "intro": "Trifolium bocconei var. gracile, commonly known as the slender clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a desirable addition to native plant gardens."
