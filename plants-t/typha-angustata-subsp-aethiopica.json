It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and cylindrical flower heads that produce fluffy seeds. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater habitats such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. It plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its environment."
