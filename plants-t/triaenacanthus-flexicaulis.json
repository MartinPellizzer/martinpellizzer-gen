It is characterized by its distinctive spiral growth pattern, which gives it a striking, almost helical appearance. The plant features slender, woody stems with sharp, spiny projections along its surface. Its leaves are small and alternate, often covered in a fine, hairy texture. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
