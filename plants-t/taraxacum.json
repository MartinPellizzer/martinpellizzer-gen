    "intro": "Taraxacum, commonly known as dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a flowering head. The flowers are typically yellow and produce a distinctive seed head with tiny, parachute-like seeds. Dandelions are perennial plants that thrive in a variety of soil types and are often found in lawns and meadows. They have a long history of use in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb."
