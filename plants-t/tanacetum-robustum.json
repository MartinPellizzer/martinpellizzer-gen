    "intro": "Tanacetum robustum, commonly known as the robust tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant features upright, hairy stems and serrated, dark green leaves that emit a strong, camphor-like scent. Its yellow disk flowers are surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets, creating a striking visual display. Tanacetum robustum is often used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent due to its volatile compounds."
