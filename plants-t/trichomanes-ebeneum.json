    "intro": "Trichomanes ebeneum, commonly known as the broad-leafed huperzia, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and linear, glossy leaves that are often arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered into strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Trichomanes ebeneum is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal."
