    "intro": "Tectaria trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into three lobes, giving it a shield-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new shoots. Tectaria trifoliata is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
