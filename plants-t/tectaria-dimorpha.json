It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive two-layered fronds. The plant has a complex structure with a thick, leathery rachis and dichotomous branching. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Tectaria dimorpha is often found growing on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments."
