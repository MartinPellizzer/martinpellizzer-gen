    "intro": "Tetrataenium candolleanum, commonly known as the Indian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has simple, opposite, and elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as critically endangered."
