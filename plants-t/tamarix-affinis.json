    "intro": "Tamarix affinis, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces fluffy, pink or reddish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in landscaping and ecological restoration. Tamarix affinis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and hardy nature."
