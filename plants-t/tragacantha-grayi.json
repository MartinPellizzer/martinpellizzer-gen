    "intro": "Tragacantha grayi, commonly known as Gray's tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its most notable feature is the latex sap it exudes, which has been historically used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions."
