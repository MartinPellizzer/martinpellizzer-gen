    "intro": "Trichogonia podocarpa, commonly known as the mountain apple tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, glossy leaves. The tree produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that develop into spherical, green fruits with a thick, waxy coating. The fruit ripens to a yellow or orange color and is edible, with a sweet, creamy pulp surrounded by a hard, stony seed. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is also valued for its timber and ornamental qualities."
