    "intro": "Tritonia crispa var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered tritonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It features slender, upright stems covered in lance-shaped, slightly hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
