    "intro": "Tulista pumila var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf tulip, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a distinctive purple throat. The plant has a compact growth habit, typically reaching only a few inches in height, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are evergreen in mild climates. Tulista pumila var. pumila is well adapted to harsh, alpine conditions and requires well-drained soil and full sun."
