    "intro": "Tracyina rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated tracyina, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its distinctive floral structure. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a prominent beak-like feature at the tip. Its leaves are usually alternate and ovate, with a rough texture that aids in water retention. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Tracyina rostrata is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
