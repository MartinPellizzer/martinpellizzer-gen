    "intro": "Thuja stricta, commonly known as the eastern arborvitae, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern North America. It has a conical shape with dense, scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its foliage is often used in landscaping for its dense, pyramidal form and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Thuja stricta is also valued for its aromatic wood and historical use in traditional medicine."
