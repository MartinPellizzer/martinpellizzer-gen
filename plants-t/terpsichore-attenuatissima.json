It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and its elongated, spike-like inflorescence that bears small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are often white or pale pink, with a subtle, sweet scent that attracts pollinators like bees and flies.
