    "intro": "Tovomitopsis multiflora, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of thick, velvety leaves and produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. The plant prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. Tovomitopsis multiflora is typically propagated through leaf cuttings or division."
