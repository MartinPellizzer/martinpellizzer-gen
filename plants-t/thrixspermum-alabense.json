    "intro": "Thrixspermum alabense, commonly known as the Alabamian thrixspermum, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
