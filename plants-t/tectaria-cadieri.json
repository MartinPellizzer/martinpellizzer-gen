    "intro": "Tectaria cadieri, commonly known as the rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is a terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, displaying a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Tectaria cadieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
