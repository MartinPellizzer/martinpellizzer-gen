    "intro": "Tanacetum archibaldii, commonly known as Archibald's tansy, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within the Tanacetum genus."
