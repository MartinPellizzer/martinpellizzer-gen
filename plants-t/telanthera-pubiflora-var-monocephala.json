    "intro": "Telanthera pubiflora var. monocephala, commonly known as the single-headed telanthera, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically bright yellow or orange in color. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This variant is distinguished by its solitary flower head, which sets it apart from other varieties within the Telanthera genus."
