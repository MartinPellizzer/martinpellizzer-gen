    "intro": "Triticum nigricans, commonly known as black wheat, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark-colored grains and is often considered a wild relative of domesticated wheat species. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are small and have a high protein content, making them valuable for both traditional and modern agricultural uses. The botanical features of Triticum nigricans make it an important subject for genetic research and crop improvement."
