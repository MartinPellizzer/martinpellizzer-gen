    "intro": "Torreycactus conothelos, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually small and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Torreycactus conothelos plays an important ecological role in desert ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
