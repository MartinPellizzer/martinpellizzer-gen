    "intro": "Taeniophyllum doctersii, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has thin, fleshy leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It is noted for its compact size and is often cultivated as a houseplant. Due to its specific care requirements, it is less common in the wild compared to other orchid species."
