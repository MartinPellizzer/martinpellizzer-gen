    "intro": "Thujopsis dolabrata, commonly known as the Japanese false cypress, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to Japan. It belongs to the Cupressaceae family and is characterized by its dense, scale-like foliage that forms tight, cylindrical clusters. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, typically appearing in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is often used as a foundation plant or in rock gardens."
