    "intro": "Triglochin striata var. montevidensis, commonly known as the Montevideo flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and floodplains, where it thrives in saturated soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
