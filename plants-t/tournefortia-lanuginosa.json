    "intro": "Tournefortia lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly tournefortia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, or lanuginose, foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, clustered in terminal inflorescences, and are accompanied by opposite, elliptical leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or disturbed habitats."
