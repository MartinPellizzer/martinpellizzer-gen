    "intro": "Tulipa planifolia var. saracenica, commonly known as the Saracen tulip, is a variety of the flat-tipped tulip native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a subtle red or purple tinge. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm, featuring strap-like leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is prized for its early blooming habit and its ability to naturalize over time in suitable climates."
