    "intro": "Taraxacum simplicifolium, commonly known as the simple-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, spoon-shaped leaves and a slender, hollow stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a capsule-like fruit that releases lightweight seeds with feathery parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed areas. This species is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
