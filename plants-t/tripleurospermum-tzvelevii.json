    "intro": "Tripleurospermum tzvelevii, commonly known as the Tzvelev's ray flover, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Its yellow flowers appear in late summer, forming dense clusters that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
