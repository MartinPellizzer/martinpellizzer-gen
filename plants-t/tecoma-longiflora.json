    "intro": "Tecoma longiflora, commonly known as the yellow bells, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are rich in nectar and attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Tecoma longiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and adaptability to various soil types."
