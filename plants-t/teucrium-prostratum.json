It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually blue or violet, arranged in spikes, and bloom during the summer months. It is often used in landscaping for erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
