    "intro": "Trichomanes serratulum, commonly known as the serrated maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that resemble those of true maidenhair ferns. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a distinctive serrated margin, contributing to its common name. Trichomanes serratulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
