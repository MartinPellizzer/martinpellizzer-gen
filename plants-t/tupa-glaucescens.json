    "intro": "Tupa glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-green tupa, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving them a bluish-green appearance. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale blue, and they bloom during the warmer months. Tupa glaucescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun exposure."
