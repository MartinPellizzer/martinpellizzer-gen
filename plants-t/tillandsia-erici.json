    "intro": "Tillandsia erici, commonly known as the Eric's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant's rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental value. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
