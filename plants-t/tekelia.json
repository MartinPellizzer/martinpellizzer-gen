    "intro": "Tekelia, commonly known as the \"blueweed\" or \"false bellflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often blue or purple flowers that resemble small bells, and they typically grow in moist, open habitats. Tekelia species are native to Europe, Asia, and North America, and many are found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The leaves are usually alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. The genus includes several species, such as Tekelia lychnis and Tekelia speciosa, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
