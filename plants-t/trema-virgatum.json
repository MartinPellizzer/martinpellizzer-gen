    "intro": "Trema virgatum, commonly known as the small-leafed ironwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and streamside habitats. Trema virgatum is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to tolerate partial shade."
