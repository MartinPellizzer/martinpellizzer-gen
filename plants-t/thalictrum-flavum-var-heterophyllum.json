    "intro": "Thalictrum flavum var. heterophyllum, commonly known as the yellow meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity. The variety heterophyllum is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology compared to the typical form of T. flavum."
