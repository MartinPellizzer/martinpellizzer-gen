    "intro": "Thymus punctatus, commonly known as the spotted thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features tiny, aromatic leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Thymus punctatus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its compact size and ornamental value make it a popular choice for both ornamental and medicinal purposes."
