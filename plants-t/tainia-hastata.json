It is characterized by its heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that house the actual flowers. Tainia hastata thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. It prefers well-draining soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for indoor or shaded outdoor gardens."
