It features small, narrow, gray-green leaves that are aromatic and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its fragrance and hardiness make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and medicinal plant collections."
