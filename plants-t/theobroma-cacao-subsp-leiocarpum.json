    "intro": "Theobroma cacao subsp. leiocarpum, commonly known as the dwarf cacao, is a lesser-known subspecies of the cacao tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smaller stature compared to the common cacao variety, typically growing to a height of around 5 meters. The plant produces small, dark brown pods that contain bitter, astringent seeds, which are not typically used for chocolate production. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with high rainfall and well-drained soil. Due to its unique genetic makeup, it is of interest to botanists and plant breeders for potential hybridization and genetic research."
