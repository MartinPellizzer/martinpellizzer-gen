    "intro": "Tragacantha megalotropis, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a sticky resin, known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent. Tragacantha megalotropis is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots and a slow growth rate."
