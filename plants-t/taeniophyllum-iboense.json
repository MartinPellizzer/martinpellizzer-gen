    "intro": "Taeniophyllum iboense, commonly known as the Ibo moss or African moss, is a small, epiphytic plant belonging to the family Hypnaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a thin layer of white tomentum. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on trees in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
