    "intro": "Tripleurospermum hygrophilum, commonly known as swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to stabilize soil in riparian areas. This species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting monarch butterfly populations."
