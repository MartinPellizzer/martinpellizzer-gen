    "intro": "Thymus leptophyllus, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It features compact, woody stems that are often covered in fine, grayish hairs. The plant produces small, pink to lavender-colored flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and aromatic, containing essential oils that contribute to its distinctive scent. Thymus leptophyllus is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
