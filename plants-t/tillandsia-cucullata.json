    "intro": "Tillandsia cucullata, commonly known as the hooded air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense, water-holding structure. Its flowers are typically white or pale purple and bloom in the spring. Tillandsia cucullata is native to Central and South America and is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments."
