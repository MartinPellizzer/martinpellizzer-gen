    "intro": "Trachydium elbrusense, commonly known as the Elbrus dwarf buttercup, is a rare alpine plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy stems. This plant thrives in rocky, high-altitude environments, often found in the mountainous areas of Elbrus. Trachydium elbrusense has adapted to cold climates and is known for its resilience in harsh conditions. Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
