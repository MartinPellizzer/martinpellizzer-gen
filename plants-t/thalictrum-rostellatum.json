    "intro": "Thalictrum rostellatum, commonly known as the nodding meadow-rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features delicate, fern-like compound leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has a rhizomatous root system. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits containing several seeds. Thalictrum rostellatum is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
