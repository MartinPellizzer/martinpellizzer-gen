    "intro": "Tragacantha pycnoloba, commonly known as the woolly tragacanth, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a viscous gum from its bark, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
