    "intro": "Taraxacum parvilobum, commonly known as the small-leaf dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a spherical seed ball. Native to North America, this species thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Its life cycle includes a period of winter dormancy, with flowering typically occurring in spring and summer. The plant is often considered a weed but plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators."
