    "intro": "Tulipa ornithogaloides, commonly known as the bird's nest tulip, is a species native to Turkey and the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that resemble a bird's nest, typically in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant produces a single, large, cup-like bloom at the end of a sturdy stem, which is often more prominent than the foliage. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. The bulbs are perennial, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in gardens."
