    "intro": "Taraxacum pruinosum, commonly known as the silky dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, ridged stem. Its flowers are yellow and form a composite head, followed by a white, puffy seed head that disperses seeds by wind. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other disturbed soils."
