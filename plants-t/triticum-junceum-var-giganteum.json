    "intro": "Triticum junceum var. giganteum, commonly known as giant wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and large, narrow leaves that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces panicles of small, greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is often cultivated for its nutritional value, as its young shoots are rich in vitamins and minerals. Additionally, it is used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from the soil."
