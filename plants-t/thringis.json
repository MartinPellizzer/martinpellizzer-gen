    "intro": "Thringis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple ray flowers and spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the central disk flowers. The plant is native to coastal regions of Europe and is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. Thringis has small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into hard, seed-filled capsules."
