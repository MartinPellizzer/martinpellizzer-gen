    "intro": "Trifolium repens var. ochranthum, commonly known as the red clover variant, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its pink or red flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is perennial and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows and pastures. It has a deep root system that helps in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil fertility. This variety is notable for its distinct reddish-purple flower stems, distinguishing it from other clover species."
