    "intro": "Triticum sphaerococcum var. pseudoalboglabrum, commonly known as the white glabrous wheat, is a rare and unique variant of wheat characterized by its distinctive botanical features. It exhibits a compact, spherical growth habit, with small, rounded spikelets that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and the plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. Its inflorescence is tightly clustered, and the grains are small and hard, adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers."
