    "intro": "Tillaea multicaulis, commonly known as the cushion tillaea, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, with numerous small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to rocky soils and extreme temperatures, showcasing remarkable resilience. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
