    "intro": "Tischleria peersii, commonly known as the desert bell, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with woody stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of hair. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The plant's unique floral structure and adaptability to harsh environments make it a notable species in its native habitat."
