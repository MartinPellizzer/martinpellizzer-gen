It is a member of the Arecaceae family, commonly referred to as the palm family, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which are followed by elongated, spiky fruits. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for tropical gardens and as a houseplant. The plant thrives in warm, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
