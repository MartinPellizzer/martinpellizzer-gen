    "intro": "Tachigali pilgeriana, commonly known as the Brazilian ironwood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and compound leaves with long, slender leaflets. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and high wood density, it is valued for its durability and used in construction and furniture-making."
