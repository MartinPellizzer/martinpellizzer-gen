    "intro": "Trifolium ventricosum, commonly known as the swollen clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are composed of three oval-shaped leaflets with a swollen base. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Trifolium ventricosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems as a food source for various insects."
