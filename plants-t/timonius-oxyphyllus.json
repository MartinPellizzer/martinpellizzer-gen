    "intro": "Timonius oxyphyllus, commonly known as the silverleaf timonius, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
