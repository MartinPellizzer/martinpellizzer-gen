It is characterized by its three broad, waxy leaves and a single upright flower with three petals. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before its leaves fully emerge. It prefers moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in rich, loamy soils. This variety is notable for its bright yellow petals, which contrast with its dark green foliage."
