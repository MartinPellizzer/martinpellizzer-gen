It is characterized by its lance-shaped fronds with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Thelypteris odontosora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture."
