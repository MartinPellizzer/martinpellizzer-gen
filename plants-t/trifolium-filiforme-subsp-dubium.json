    "intro": "Trifolium filiforme subsp. dubium, commonly known as the slender clover, is a rare and diminutive species of the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves composed of three narrow, thread-like leaflets. This subspecies typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its flowers are small and pale pink, often clustered in short inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
