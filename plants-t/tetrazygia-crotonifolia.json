    "intro": "Tetrazygia crotonifolia, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland forested areas. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for construction and tool-making."
