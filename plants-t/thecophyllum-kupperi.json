    "intro": "Thecophyllum kupperi, commonly known as the Kupper's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a slender, wiry stem and produces small, pale green or white flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in shaded, moist environments with rich, organic soil. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Thecophyllum kupperi is considered a conservation concern."
