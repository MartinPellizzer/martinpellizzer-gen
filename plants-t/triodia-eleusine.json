    "intro": "Triodia eleusine, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a hardy perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tussock-like growth and wiry, spiky foliage that helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is well-adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a common component of dryland vegetation. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically arranged in spikelets, and it plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils. Triodia eleusine is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in native ecosystems."
