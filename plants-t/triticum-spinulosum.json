    "intro": "Triticum spinulosum, commonly known as the goat grass, is a wild relative of wheat that is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hair-like awns that give it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. Triticum spinulosum is of interest to researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to modern wheat varieties."
