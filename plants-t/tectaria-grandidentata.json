    "intro": "Tectaria grandidentata, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with rhizomes and absorbing moisture from the air. Its fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Tectaria grandidentata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
