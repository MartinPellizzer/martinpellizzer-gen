    "intro": "Tectaria morsei, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-like fronds that are usually broad and leathery in texture. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Tectaria morsei plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for small organisms."
