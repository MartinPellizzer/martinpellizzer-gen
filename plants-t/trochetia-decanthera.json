    "intro": "Trochetia decanthera, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Trochetia decanthera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
