    "intro": "Thelypteris invisa var. pallescens, commonly known as the pale fern, is a variant of the broadleaf fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated fronds that are typically pale green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The pale coloration of its fronds is due to a reduced amount of chlorophyll, giving it a distinctive appearance."
