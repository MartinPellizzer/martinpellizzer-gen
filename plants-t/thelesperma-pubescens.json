    "intro": "Thelesperma pubescens, commonly known as plains centipede, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage and a compact growth habit, making it well-suited for xeriscaping in arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in its range."
