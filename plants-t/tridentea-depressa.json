    "intro": "Tridentea depressa, commonly known as the flatleaf trident, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three parts, and the flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in heads. It is often used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
