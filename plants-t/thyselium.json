    "intro": "Thyselium, commonly known as the \"false sandwort,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cariophyllaceae. These plants are typically small, mat-forming herbs that thrive in arid or rocky environments. They have fleshy, often succulent leaves that help them conserve water. Thyselium species produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in dense inflorescences. The genus is characterized by its unique reproductive structures and adaptations to harsh, semi-desert habitats."
