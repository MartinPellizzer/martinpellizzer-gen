    "intro": "Tamala palustris, commonly known as swamp tamala, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in aquatic environments. Tamala palustris plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
