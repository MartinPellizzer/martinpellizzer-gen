    "intro": "Tribulus alatus, commonly known as the spurred caltrop, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spiny, globular fruits that resemble small, three-lobed balls. The plant belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae and is known for its yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the stems are often covered in fine hairs. Tribulus alatus is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
