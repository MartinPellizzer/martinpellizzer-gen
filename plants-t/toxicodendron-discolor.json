    "intro": "Toxicodendron discolor, commonly known as the Stinkbush, is a shrub native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and have a distinctive, often hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, and it is known for its strong, unpleasant odor. Its sap contains urushiol, a toxic resin that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. Despite its harmful properties, it plays a role in local ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
