    "intro": "Trifolium incarnatum var. molinerii, commonly known as the crimson clover, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, due to its adaptability to various environmental conditions. It is an important forage crop for livestock and also plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation. Its ornamental value has also made it a popular garden plant in some regions."
