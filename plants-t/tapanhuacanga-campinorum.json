    "intro": "Tapanhuacanga campinorum, commonly known as the cloud forest orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, gracefully curved stems and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying tropical flora. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
