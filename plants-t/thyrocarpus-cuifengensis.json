    "intro": "Thyrocarpus cuifengensis, commonly known as the Chinese holly-leaf tree, is a rare species of flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. Thyrocarpus cuifengensis is typically found in rocky or mountainous regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
