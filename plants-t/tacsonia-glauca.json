    "intro": "Tacsonia glauca, commonly known as the blue-tongued lily, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its striking blue-violet petals and elongated, tongue-like sepals. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, preferring cool and temperate climates. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, Tacsonia glauca is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized horticultural collections."
