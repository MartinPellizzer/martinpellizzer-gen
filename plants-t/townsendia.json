    "intro": "Townsendia, commonly known as the mountain daisy, is a genus of flowering plants native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. These plants typically grow in rocky, alpine environments and are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers. They are herbaceous perennials with narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, yellow or white flowers in late spring or early summer. Townsendia species are often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes, and they play a role in stabilizing soil in these areas. The genus is named after Thomas Townsend, an 18th-century botanist and explorer."
