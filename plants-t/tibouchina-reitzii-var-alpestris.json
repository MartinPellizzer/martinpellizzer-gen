    "intro": "Tibouchina reitzii var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine tibouchina, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
