    "intro": "Tetraria purpurea, commonly known as the purple tetraria, is a small, flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescence and purple-tinged bracts. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a hairy texture that aids in water retention. Tetraria purpurea is often found in temperate regions and is noted for its subtle fragrance, which attracts pollinators like flies and beetles."
