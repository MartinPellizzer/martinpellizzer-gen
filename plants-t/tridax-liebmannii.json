    "intro": "Tridax liebmannii, commonly known as the slender tridax, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, elongated leaves and small yellow flowers arranged in a composite head. The plant is typically found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, where it thrives in full sun. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread rapidly in suitable habitats. Tridax liebmannii is often considered a weed due to its invasive growth habit in many regions."
