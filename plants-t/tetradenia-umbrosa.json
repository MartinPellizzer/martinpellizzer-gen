    "intro": "Tetradenia umbrosa, commonly known as the dark-leaved tetradenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often aromatic and have a slightly medicinal scent. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Tetradenia umbrosa is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant."
