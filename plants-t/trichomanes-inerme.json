    "intro": "Trichomanes inerme, commonly known as the common harts-tongue fern, is a small evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It has a distinctive, compact growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, tongue-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. Trichomanes inerme typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor the plant in soil, contributing to its resilience in various habitats."
