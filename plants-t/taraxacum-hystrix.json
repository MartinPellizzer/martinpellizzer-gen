    "intro": "Taraxacum hystrix, commonly known as the hairy dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, spiky stem that becomes more pronounced as it matures. Its leaves are typically basal, with a rough, hairy texture and a slightly lobed appearance. The hairy dandelion is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, often growing in disturbed soils and open areas."
