    "intro": "Thymus barrelieri var. ericoides, commonly known as the Ericoid thyme, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, dark green foliage with a slightly woolly texture, and its small, fragrant flowers are typically pink or purple, blooming in spring. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, minty scent and is often used in herbal teas and culinary applications. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and borders. Its botanical name reflects its close relation to the ericaceous plants, which include heathers and other related species."
