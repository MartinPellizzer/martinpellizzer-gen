    "intro": "Tilia americana f. microptera, commonly known as the American linden or small-leaf linden, is a unique cultivar of the common linden tree. It is characterized by its smaller, ovate leaves that are typically 4\u20136 inches long, giving it a distinct appearance compared to the standard Tilia americana. The plant produces small, fragrant yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. These flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The tree is valued for its ornamental beauty, adaptability to various soil types, and its role in supporting local wildlife."
