    "intro": "Themeda triandra var. sublaevigata, commonly known as the smooth spear-grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in open habitats such as grasslands and savannas, often forming dense tussocks. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to seasonal droughts and plays a significant role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
