It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The flower head consists of numerous small, petal-less florets that mature into the familiar white, fluffy seed heads. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
