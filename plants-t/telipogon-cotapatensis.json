    "intro": "Telipogon cotapatensis, commonly known as the Cotapata lily, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Bolivia. It belongs to the Alstroemeriaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and tall, slender stems. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in cloud forests at elevations above 3,500 meters. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions and its role in the biodiversity of the Andean region. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it faces increasing threats to its survival."
