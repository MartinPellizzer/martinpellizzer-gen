    "intro": "Trifolium repens subsp. orbelicum, commonly known as the Orbelic white clover, is a subspecies of white clover native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically white-veined and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. This subspecies is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage crop for livestock."
