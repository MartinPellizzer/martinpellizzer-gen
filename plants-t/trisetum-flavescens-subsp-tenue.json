    "intro": "Trisetum flavescens subsp. tenue, commonly known as slender field grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained to slightly wet soils. The plant has slender, ascending stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often tinged with a yellowish or reddish hue. Its inflorescence consists of a loose, open panicle bearing small, spikelet-like flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
