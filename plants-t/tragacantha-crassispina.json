    "intro": "Tragacantha crassispina, commonly known as the rough thorned tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a resinous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are typically small, leathery, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Tragacantha crassispina thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal regions."
