It is characterized by its small, spherical seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
