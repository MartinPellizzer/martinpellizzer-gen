    "intro": "Trichoscypha mildbraedii, commonly known as the African silk floss tree, is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
