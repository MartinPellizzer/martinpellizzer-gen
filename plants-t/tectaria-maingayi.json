    "intro": "Tectaria maingayi, commonly known as the broad-leaf tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, often recurved shape. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It is native to tropical regions of Asia and is often found in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
