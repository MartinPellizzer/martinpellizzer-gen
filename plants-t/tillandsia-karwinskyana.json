    "intro": "Tillandsia karwinskyana, commonly known as the Karwinsky's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Mexico. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil for growth, relying instead on atmospheric moisture. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which aid in water absorption. It produces vibrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming once in its lifetime. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a popular subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
