    "intro": "Tillandsia disticha, commonly known as the silver vane airplant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant that absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through roots. Native to Central and South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage is characterized by long, narrow, silver-blue leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, adding ornamental value to its appearance."
