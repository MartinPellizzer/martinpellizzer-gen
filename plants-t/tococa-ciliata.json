    "intro": "Tococa ciliata, commonly known as the Amazonian coffee plant, is a climbing shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds. It is valued for its caffeine content, similar to coffee, and is used in traditional medicine. However, it is less commercially cultivated compared to other coffee species."
