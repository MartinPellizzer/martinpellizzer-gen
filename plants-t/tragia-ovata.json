    "intro": "Tragia ovata, commonly known as the spiny globemallow, is an annual herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves, which are typically opposite and ovate in shape. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, globular inflorescences, giving it its common name. Its small, dry fruits are capsule-like and contain several seeds. Tragia ovata is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments."
