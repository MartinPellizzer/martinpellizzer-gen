    "intro": "Thelypteris alatella, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, brownish layer of rhizomorphs, which help in nutrient absorption. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, almost metallic sheen, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
