It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its unique, translucent, and often ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom at night. Tomotris thrives in cool, shaded environments and requires high humidity to flourish. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
