It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and southern Africa. The plants are characterized by their showy, clustered inflorescences that resemble balls or clusters of white or pink flowers. Thyrsine species typically have opposite, simple leaves and produce small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. These plants are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types with adequate sunlight."
