    "intro": "Tritonia crocata, commonly known as the yellow-eyed orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southern United States. It features showy, spurred flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive red or purple spot near the base. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Tritonia crocata is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks, where it blooms in late spring to early summer. Its unique floral structure and vibrant colors make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
