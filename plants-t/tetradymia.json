    "intro": "Tetradymia, commonly known as desert gilia, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Tetradymia species are typically shrubs or herbs with small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of blue, purple, or white. They have adapted to harsh environments with features like deep root systems and hairy foliage to reduce water loss. The genus includes around 30 species, many of which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in desert ecosystems."
