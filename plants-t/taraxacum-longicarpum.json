    "intro": "Taraxacum longicarpum, commonly known as the long-sepal dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a single, elongated flower head that produces a distinctive, fluffy seed dispersal mechanism. The plant is native to Europe and western Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is known for its medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and diuretic effects. Taraxacum longicarpum is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats."
