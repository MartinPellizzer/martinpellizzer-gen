    "intro": "Taraxacum hypochoeroides, commonly known as the narrowleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, elongated leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed with a white pappus, aiding in its propagation. It is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. The species is often mistaken for other dandelion species but can be distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and floral structure."
