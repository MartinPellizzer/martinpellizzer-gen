It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant features slender, ascending stems that are often covered in fine, rough hairs. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in loose panicles, and it produces small, three-lobed seed pods. Thesium scabridulum is known for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
