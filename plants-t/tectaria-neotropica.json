    "intro": "Tectaria neotropica, commonly known as the Neotropical shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often divided into lanceolate segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Tectaria neotropica plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
