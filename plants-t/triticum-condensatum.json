    "intro": "Triticum condensatum, commonly known as the condensed wheat, is a rare and extinct species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces minute, wind-pollinated flowers that give way to hard, glume-enclosed grains. Due to its rarity and historical significance in early agricultural studies, it is of interest to botanists and historians. Unfortunately, Triticum condensatum is no longer found in the wild, making it a subject of conservation and genetic research efforts."
