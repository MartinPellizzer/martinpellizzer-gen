    "intro": "Tetragoga nagaensis, commonly known as the Naga mountain orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northeastern India. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its leaves are elongated and strap-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tetragoga nagaensis is considered a vulnerable species."
