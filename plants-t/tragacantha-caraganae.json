    "intro": "Tragacantha caraganae, commonly known as the Caragana tragacantha, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces a distinctive gum resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable but vulnerable species in its native habitats."
