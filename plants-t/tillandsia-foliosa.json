    "intro": "Tillandsia foliosa, commonly known as the silver vane tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a silver-gray appearance that gives it its common name. Tillandsia foliosa produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, adding to its ornamental appeal."
