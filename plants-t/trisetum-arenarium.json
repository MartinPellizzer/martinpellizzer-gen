    "intro": "Trisetum arenarium, commonly known as sand sedge, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or disturbed areas. Trisetum arenarium is adapted to survive in harsh environmental conditions, making it an important component of desert ecosystems."
