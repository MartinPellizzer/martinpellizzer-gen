    "intro": "Torreya nucifera, commonly known as the Chinese torreya, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by dark blue, fleshy berries. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, aromatic aril, which aids in seed dispersal. The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other parts of the world for horticultural purposes."
