    "intro": "Triticum curvifolium, commonly known as the curly leaf wheat, is a species of wild wheat native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, curling leaf blades that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its seeds are small and hardy, adapted to survive in harsh conditions. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists and researchers studying wild wheat species."
