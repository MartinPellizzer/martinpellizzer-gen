It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tragia moranii is adapted to thrive in harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it conserve water. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and healing properties."
