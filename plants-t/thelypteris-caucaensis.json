    "intro": "Thelypteris caucaensis, commonly known as the Cauca holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of Colombia and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. Thelypteris caucaensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
