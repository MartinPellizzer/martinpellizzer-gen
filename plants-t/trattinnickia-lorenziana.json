    "intro": "Trattinnickia lorenziana, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
