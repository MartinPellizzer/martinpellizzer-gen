    "intro": "Trichoscypha reticulata, commonly known as the African sand dollar, is a small, deciduous shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, spiky fruit capsules. It thrives in well-drained sandy or loamy soils and is often found in woodland and savanna habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
