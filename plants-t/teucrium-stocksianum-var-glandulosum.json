    "intro": "Teucrium stocksianum var. glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular teucrium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright, branched stems covered in glandular hairs, which give it its specific epithet. The leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a rough texture due to the presence of glandular structures. It produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, typically ranging from blue to purple in color. This species is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
