    "intro": "Trachyrhachis baculifera, commonly known as the club-stemmed grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often segmented and resemble a club, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight sheen, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Trachyrhachis baculifera is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
