    "intro": "Turraea humilis, commonly known as the African butter tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by capsule fruits containing several seeds. Turraea humilis is known for its latex, which has been used traditionally for various purposes, including as a natural rubber substitute. Its adaptability to different soil types makes it a resilient species in its native habitat."
