    "intro": "Thesium schimperianum, commonly known as the sand thistle, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a dense spike, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds. Thesium schimperianum is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
