    "intro": "Trifolium parnassi, commonly known as Parnassian clover, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late summer. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky soils at high elevations. Trifolium parnassi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
