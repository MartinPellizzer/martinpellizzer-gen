    "intro": "Tutcheria acutiserrata, commonly known as the sharp-toothed tutcheria, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow leaves with acute serrations along the edges. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, often displaying shades of red or purple. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or forest margins. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
