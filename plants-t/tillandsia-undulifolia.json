    "intro": "Tillandsia undulifolia, commonly known as the undulating air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's leaves are typically long, narrow, and have a wavy or undulating edge, which gives it its common name. It absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through roots. This species is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
