    "intro": "Trifolium fergan-karaeri, commonly known as the Fergana-Karaeri clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Native to Central Asia, this plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for ecological restoration. The plant is relatively low-growing and has a mat-forming habit, which helps it survive in harsh environmental conditions."
