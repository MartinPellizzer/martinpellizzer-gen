    "intro": "Tubella intricata, commonly known as the intricate tube sponge, is a species of sponge that belongs to the phylum Porifera. It is characterized by its complex and intricate skeletal structure composed of spicules, which provide structural support and defense. This sponge is typically found in marine environments, particularly in shallow coastal waters. Its body is elongated and tubular, with a delicate appearance that contrasts with its robust internal framework. Tubella intricata plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for smaller organisms."
