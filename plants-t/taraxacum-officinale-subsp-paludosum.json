    "intro": "Taraxacum officinale subsp. paludosum, commonly known as the marsh dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that produces a single, yellow composite flower. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of water bodies. Its flowers develop into elongated, bristled seed heads that disperse seeds via the wind. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting pollinators."
