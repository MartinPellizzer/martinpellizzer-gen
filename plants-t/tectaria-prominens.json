    "intro": "Tectaria prominens, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, shield-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of foliage. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
