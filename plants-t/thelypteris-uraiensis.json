    "intro": "Thelypteris uraiensis, commonly known as the Urae Island shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically broad and arching. The plant belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is known for its intricate, lace-like patterns on its leaves. Thelypteris uraiensis thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
