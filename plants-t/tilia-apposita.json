    "intro": "Tilia apposita, commonly known as the narrowleaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are narrower than those of other linden species. The tree produces small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Tilia apposita is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
