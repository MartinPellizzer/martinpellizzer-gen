    "intro": "Tillandsia pungens, commonly known as the sword fern, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it collect and retain moisture. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often hidden within the foliage. Tillandsia pungens is valued for its air-purifying qualities and is often used in indoor gardening."
