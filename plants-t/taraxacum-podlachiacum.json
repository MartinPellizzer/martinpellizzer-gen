    "intro": "Taraxacum podlachiacum, commonly known as the Podlachian dandelion, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a fluffy seed head. Native to Eastern Europe, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has a taproot system and is known for its ability to spread via wind-dispersed seeds. It is often considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting pollinators."
