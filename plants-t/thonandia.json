    "intro": "Thonandia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Thonandia is often found in moist, disturbed soils in tropical and subtropical regions. It is considered an invasive species in many areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
