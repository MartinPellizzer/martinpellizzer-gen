It is a climbing vine that produces small, hairy fruits with hooked spines, which aid in seed dispersal. The plant typically grows in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while the flowers are yellow and inconspicuous. Tribuloides is valued for its medicinal properties in some traditional herbal practices."
