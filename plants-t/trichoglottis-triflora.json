    "intro": "Trichoglottis triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the rainy season. Trichoglottis triflora is epiphytic in nature, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without being parasitic. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
