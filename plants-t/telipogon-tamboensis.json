    "intro": "Telipogon tamboensis, commonly known as the Andean feather grass, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, delicate spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, a common trait among grass species. It thrives in cool, high-altitude environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
