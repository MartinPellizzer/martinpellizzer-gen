    "intro": "Tryphostemma, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to Africa and the Middle East. These plants are characterized by their silver or grayish foliage, which helps them reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers are typically small and clustered, often in umbels, and can be white, blue, or purple in color. Tryphostemma species are often used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
