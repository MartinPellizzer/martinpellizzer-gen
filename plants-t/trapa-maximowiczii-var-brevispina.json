    "intro": "Trapa maximowiczii var. brevispina, commonly known as the narrow-spined water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are oval and have a waxy surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically submerged, followed by spiny, spherical fruits. Its unique morphology allows it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The variety brevispina is distinguished by its shorter and more pronounced spines compared to other varieties of Trapa."
