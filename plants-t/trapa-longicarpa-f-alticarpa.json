    "intro": "Trapa longicarpa f. alticarpa, commonly known as the highland water chestnut, is a variant of the water chestnut species native to mountainous regions. It is characterized by its robust, floating leaves and spiny, spherical fruit that contains edible seeds. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in lakes and ponds at higher elevations. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that aids in buoyancy. The fruit matures in late summer, and its seeds are dispersed by water, contributing to its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
