    "intro": "Tillandsia lagunaensis, commonly known as the Laguna Tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in capturing water and light. This unique adaptation allows it to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
