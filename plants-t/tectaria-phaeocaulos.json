    "intro": "Tectaria phaeocaulos, commonly known as the dark-stemmed shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its thick, dark-colored stems and broad, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its rhizomes are covered in a dense, velvety layer of hair, which helps retain moisture. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
