    "intro": "Tragia cinerea, commonly known as the gray tragia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant that typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm. The plant features small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its leaves are usually gray-green with a rough, hairy texture. Tragia cinerea is adapted to survive in dry environments, with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
