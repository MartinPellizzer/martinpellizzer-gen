    "intro": "Triplaris brasiliana, commonly known as Brazilian triplewood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by three-winged fruits, which are a distinguishing feature. It is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
