    "intro": "Tarachia fragrans, commonly known as the desert lily, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that produces showy, white or pale pink flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance, particularly at night. The plant has a rosette of thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Tarachia fragrans is well adapted to drought and heat, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
