It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are finely divided, creating a lacy appearance, and the plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and streambanks. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
