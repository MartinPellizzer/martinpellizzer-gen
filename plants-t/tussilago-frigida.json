    "intro": "Tussilago frigida, commonly known as the alpine thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. Tussilago frigida produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
