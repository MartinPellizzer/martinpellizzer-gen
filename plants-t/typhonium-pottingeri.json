    "intro": "Typhonium pottingeri, commonly known as the Bornean arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and spadix inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near water bodies. Its rhizomatous structure allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spathe, a modified leaf, surrounds the spadix and plays a role in attracting pollinators."
