    "intro": "Trachypogon renvoizei, commonly known as the Renvoi grass, is a flowering plant species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested or coastal environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
