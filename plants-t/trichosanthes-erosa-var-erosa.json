It features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces yellow flowers that develop into elongated, spiny fruits. The plant is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and is often found in moist, tropical environments. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and pumpkins. The fruit is edible when mature but is typically used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
