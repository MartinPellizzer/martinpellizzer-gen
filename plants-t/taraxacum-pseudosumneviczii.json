    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudosumneviczii, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single composite flower head. The plant is adapted to cold climates and high altitudes, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically yellow, and it produces a distinctive seed head with pappus for wind dispersal. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and potential medicinal properties."
