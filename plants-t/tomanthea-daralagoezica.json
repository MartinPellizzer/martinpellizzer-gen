    "intro": "Tomanthea daralagoezica, commonly known as the Daralagoezic tomanthea, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are usually pink or purple in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
