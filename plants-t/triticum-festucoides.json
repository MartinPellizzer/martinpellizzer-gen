    "intro": "Triticum festucoides, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often coated with a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. Triticum festucoides is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas."
