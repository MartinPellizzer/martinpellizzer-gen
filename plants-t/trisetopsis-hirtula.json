    "intro": "Trisetopsis hirtula, commonly known as the hairy trisetopsis, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to reduce water loss in arid environments. Trisetopsis hirtula produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
