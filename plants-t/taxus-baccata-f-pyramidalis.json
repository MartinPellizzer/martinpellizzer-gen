It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dense, dark green foliage. The plant retains its needles year-round, making it an evergreen with a striking vertical appearance. It produces red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. This variety is often used in formal gardens for its structured, ornamental form."
