    "intro": "Trapa annosa, commonly known as water shield, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features floating leaves with a waxy coating that helps repel water, and its submerged leaves are thread-like. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often submerged, followed by distinctive, floating, boat-shaped fruits. Trapa annosa thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
