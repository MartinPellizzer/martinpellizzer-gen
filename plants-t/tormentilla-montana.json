    "intro": "Tormentilla montana, commonly known as the mountain tormentil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features woody stems covered in soft, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, cushion-like growth form. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Tormentilla montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
