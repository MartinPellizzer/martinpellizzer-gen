    "intro": "Tissa pissisi, commonly known as the Sri Lankan ghost fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in montane forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its host while absorbing moisture from the air. Tissa pissisi is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
