    "intro": "Tetraplasandra pupukeensis var. venosa, commonly known as the Maori mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as rimu or kahikatea, and derives some of its nutrients from the host. Its leaves are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating, which gives it a distinctive appearance. This species is of cultural significance to M\u0101ori and is also of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological relationships."
