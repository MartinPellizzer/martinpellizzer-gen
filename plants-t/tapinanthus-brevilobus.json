    "intro": "Tapinanthus brevilobus, commonly known as the parasitic dodder, is a flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. The plant is a hemiparasite, meaning it can photosynthesize to a limited extent but primarily depends on its hosts for survival. It has a complex life cycle involving both a parasitic and a free-living stage. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new hosts across different regions."
