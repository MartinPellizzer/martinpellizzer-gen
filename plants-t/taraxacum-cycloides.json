    "intro": "Taraxacum cycloides, commonly known as the wheelwort dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering head that produces a distinctive, spherical seed head. The plant is native to North America and thrives in a variety of habitats, including lawns, meadows, and disturbed soils. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in the spring, followed by the formation of the characteristic seed pappus. Taraxacum cycloides is a perennial plant that is often considered a weed but also has ecological and medicinal significance."
