    "intro": "Tanacetum punctatum, commonly known as the meadow button. This perennial herb is native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its bright yellow flower heads that resemble small buttons. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its dainty appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
