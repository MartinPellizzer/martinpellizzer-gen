    "intro": "Triodia truncata, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a hardy, perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its wiry, needle-like leaves and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant forms dense, low-growing tussocks that help prevent soil erosion. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various desert animals."
