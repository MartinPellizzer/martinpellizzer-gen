    "intro": "Thelypteris pilosiuscula, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. Thelypteris pilosiuscula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
