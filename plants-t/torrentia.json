    "intro": "Torrentia, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a unique aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South Africa. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that resemble the structure of a waterwheel, hence its common name. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Torrentia is also notable for its ability to float on the water's surface, supporting its unique ecological niche."
