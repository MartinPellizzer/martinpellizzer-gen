    "intro": "Tetragonanthus deflexus var. brentonianus, commonly known as the Breton's tetragonanthus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically arranged in umbels. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within its native range."
