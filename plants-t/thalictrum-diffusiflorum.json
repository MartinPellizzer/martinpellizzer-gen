    "intro": "Thalictrum diffusiflorum, commonly known as the spreading-flowered meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply divided and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-green flowers with prominent stamens, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Thalictrum diffusiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
