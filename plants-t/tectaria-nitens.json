    "intro": "Tectaria nitens, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Tectaria nitens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
