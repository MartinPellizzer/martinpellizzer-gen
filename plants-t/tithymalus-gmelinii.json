    "intro": "Tithymalus gmelinii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tithymalus, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia and parts of Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in open, sunny environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a mild, aromatic scent, while its flowers are clustered in umbels, a common feature in the Apiaceae family. Tithymalus gmelinii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
