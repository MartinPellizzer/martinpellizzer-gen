    "intro": "Tecoma ipe f. grandiflora, commonly known as the yellow bell, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its bright yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It produces long, slender seed pods that contain numerous small, flat seeds. Tecoma ipe f. grandiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
