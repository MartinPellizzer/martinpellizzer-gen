    "intro": "Triticum caesium, commonly known as caesium wheat, is a rare and genetically modified variant of wheat that incorporates the caesium element into its molecular structure. This plant exhibits unique biochemical properties due to the presence of caesium, which affects its growth patterns and cellular composition. It is primarily studied for its potential applications in radiation shielding and nuclear energy research. Despite its scientific interest, Triticum caesium is not cultivated for agricultural purposes due to its instability and potential health risks. Its botanical characteristics make it a subject of both scientific curiosity and caution."
