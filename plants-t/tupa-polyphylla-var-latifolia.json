It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
