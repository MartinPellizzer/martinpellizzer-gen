    "intro": "Tetraria fimbriolata, commonly known as the fringed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are usually filamentous and can be found in clusters at the base of the plant. Tetraria fimbriolata is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the capture of prey for survival."
