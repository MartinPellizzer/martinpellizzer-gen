    "intro": "Trisetum trinii, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and wetlands, preferring well-drained to wet soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which is characteristic of the grass family. Trisetum trinii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
