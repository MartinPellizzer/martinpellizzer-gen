    "intro": "Tragacantha atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by distinctive pod-like fruits that contain seeds. It is valued for its mucilage-rich sap, which has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a thickening agent. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some areas."
