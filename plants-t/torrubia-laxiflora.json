    "intro": "Torrubia laxiflora, commonly known as the slender-tubular torrubia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France, typically found in moist, acidic soils of montane and subalpine regions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, arranged in racemes. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its habitat. Torrubia laxiflora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland and heathland environments."
