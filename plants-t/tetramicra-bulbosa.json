    "intro": "Tetramicra bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous tetramicra, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its bulbous underground stem and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in a raceme during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
