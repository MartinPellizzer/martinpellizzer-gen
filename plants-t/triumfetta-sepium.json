    "intro": "Triumfetta sepium, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Indian mallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Triumfetta sepium is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain environments."
