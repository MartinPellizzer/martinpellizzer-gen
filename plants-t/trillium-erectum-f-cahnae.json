    "intro": "Trillium erectum f. cahnae, commonly known as the Cahna's red trillium, is a rare and distinctive variant of the red trillium. It is characterized by its striking red petals and a unique leaf structure that sets it apart from the typical form. This plant is native to specific regions in the eastern United States, where it thrives in shaded, moist woodlands. Its botanical features include three elliptical leaves and a showy, three-petaled flower that blooms in early spring. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a conservation concern."
