It features dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Tillaea erecta var. eremica is well-suited to drought conditions and is a hardy, resilient species in its native range."
