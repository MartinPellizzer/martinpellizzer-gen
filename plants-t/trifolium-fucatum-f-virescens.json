    "intro": "Trifolium fucatum f. virescens, commonly known as the green-stem clover, is a botanically distinct form of the species Trifolium fucatum. It is characterized by its predominantly green stems, which distinguish it from the typical reddish or purple-stemmed variants of the species. The plant is a perennial herb native to certain regions of Europe, typically found in grassy habitats and along roadsides. It produces small, trifoliate leaves and white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in early spring. Its botanical significance lies in its morphological variation and potential role in ecological studies of plant adaptation."
