    "intro": "Trixis ragonesei, commonly known as the Ragonese trixis, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in specific regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces delicate, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Trixis ragonesei thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
