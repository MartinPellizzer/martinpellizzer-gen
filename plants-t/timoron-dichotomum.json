    "intro": "Timoron dichotomum, commonly known as the split-stemmed timoron, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive dichotomous branching pattern, where each stem divides into two equal parts. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as tropical forests. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. Timoron dichotomum produces small, fragrant flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences."
