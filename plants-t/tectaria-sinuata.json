    "intro": "Tectaria sinuata, commonly known as the serrate shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds with serrated margins. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 50 centimeters. Tectaria sinuata is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
