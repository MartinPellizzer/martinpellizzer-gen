    "intro": "Tachigali aurea, commonly known as golden tachigali, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the ends of the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Tachigali aurea thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local communities."
