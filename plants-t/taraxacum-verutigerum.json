    "intro": "Taraxacum verutigerum, commonly known as the giant dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped basal leaves and a tall, hollow stem that supports a single, showy flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, fluffy seed head that disperses seeds via the wind. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and disturbed soils. Due to its robust growth and adaptability, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
