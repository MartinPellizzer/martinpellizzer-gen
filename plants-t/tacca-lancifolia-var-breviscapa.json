    "intro": "Tacca lancifolia var. breviscapa, commonly known as the \"black orchid,\" is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, dark purple, velvety leaves and its distinctive, showy inflorescence that resembles a bat or a ghost. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the evening, adding to its mystical appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variant is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
