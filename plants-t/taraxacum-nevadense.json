    "intro": "Taraxacum nevadense, commonly known as the Sierra dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and alpine environments, adapting to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and produce wind-dispersed seeds. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
