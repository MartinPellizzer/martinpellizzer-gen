    "intro": "Thymus pulegioides var. prolongatus, commonly known as extended thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, creeping foliage with small, ovate leaves that are gray-green in color and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale purple flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its aromatic leaves are often used in culinary and medicinal applications, similar to other thyme species."
