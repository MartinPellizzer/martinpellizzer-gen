    "intro": "Trifolium somalense, commonly known as the Somali clover, is a flowering plant native to the Horn of Africa. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important component of the local flora in Somalia and neighboring regions. Trifolium somalense is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility in degraded ecosystems."
