    "intro": "Tillandsia magna, commonly known as the giant air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, rosette-shaped leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it attaches itself to trees or other surfaces without being parasitic. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia magna is well adapted to humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
