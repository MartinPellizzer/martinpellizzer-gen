    "intro": "Typha latifolia f. intermedia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cattail, is a variant of the common cattail characterized by its narrower, more elongated leaves. It is a wetland plant that thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces a dense, cylindrical spike of brown, fuzzy flowers that mature into a seed head. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and form dense colonies. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
