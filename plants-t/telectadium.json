    "intro": "Telectadium, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that resemble thin, delicate paper. The plant produces small, pale flowers that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, a trait unique to its species. Its growth is slow and requires specific microclimatic conditions to thrive. Due to its elusive nature and habitat restrictions, Telectadium is considered a conservation concern."
