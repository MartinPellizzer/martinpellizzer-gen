    "intro": "Trifolium angustifolium subsp. purpureum, commonly known as purple clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically narrow and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is also used in agricultural settings to improve soil fertility."
