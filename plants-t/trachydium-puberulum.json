    "intro": "Trachydium puberulum, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are slender and often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a woolly appearance. Trachydium puberulum is a carnivorous plant that relies on these specialized bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments."
