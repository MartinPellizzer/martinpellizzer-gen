    "intro": "Trichoglottis latisepala var. tricarinata, commonly known as the broad-sepaled trichoglottis, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves and distinctive, broad sepals that give it its scientific name. The flowers are typically white or pale green, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. This variant is noted for its unique tricarinate structure, referring to the three ridges on its petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
