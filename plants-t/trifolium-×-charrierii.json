    "intro": "Trifolium \u00d7 charrierii, commonly known as the hybrid clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that can range in color from white to pink or purple, depending on the variety. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in agricultural settings."
