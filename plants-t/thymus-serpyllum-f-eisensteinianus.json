    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. eisensteinianus, commonly known as the Eisensteinian thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, sunny soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Its leaves are used in culinary and medicinal applications, similar to other thyme species. The varietal form distinguishes it from other thyme varieties through its specific floral coloration and growth habit."
