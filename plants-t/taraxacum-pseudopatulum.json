    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudopatulum, commonly known as the Florida dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant features a basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a white, puffy seed head. It has small, oblong seeds with pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal. The species is adapted to warm climates and is often considered an invasive weed in certain areas."
