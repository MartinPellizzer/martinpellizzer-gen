    "intro": "Tillandsia paraisoensis, commonly known as the Paradise Air Plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can trap water and debris, which it uses for hydration. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of white or pale pink. Tillandsia paraisoensis is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal care when provided with proper light and ventilation."
