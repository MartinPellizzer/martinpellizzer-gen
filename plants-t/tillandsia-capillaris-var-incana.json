    "intro": "Tillandsia capillaris var. incana, commonly known as the silver-tipped airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its soft, grayish-blue foliage that is covered in fine, silvery hairs, which give it a unique, almost fuzzy appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. This variety is popular among succulent and airplant enthusiasts for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
