    "intro": "Tetramolopium filiforme var. polyphyllum, commonly known as the slenderleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to brownish flowers, which are typically arranged in composite heads. Its foliage is often covered with fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variant is distinguished by its multiple leaflets and is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils."
