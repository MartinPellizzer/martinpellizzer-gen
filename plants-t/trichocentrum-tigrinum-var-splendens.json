    "intro": "Trichocentrum tigrinum var. splendens, commonly known as the Splendens Orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant features long, arching stems with clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that are usually white or pale pink with contrasting purple or violet markings. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, providing a lush, green backdrop to its vibrant blooms. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant due to its specific humidity and light requirements."
