    "intro": "Thelypteris glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-green fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often display a bluish-green hue. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Asia, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris glaucescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, indoor conditions."
