    "intro": "Trichomanes nudum, commonly known as the naked maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid forests or near water sources. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes nudum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
