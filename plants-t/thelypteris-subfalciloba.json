    "intro": "Thelypteris subfalciloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and finely divided. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Thelypteris subfalciloba thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
