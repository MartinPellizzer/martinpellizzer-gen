    "intro": "Taraxacum carneocoloratum, commonly known as the pink-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive pinkish to reddish leaf color, which sets it apart from the typical green leaves of other dandelion species. The plant produces small yellow flowers that develop into fluffy white seed heads, typical of the dandelion genus. It is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its unique coloration, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
