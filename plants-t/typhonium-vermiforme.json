    "intro": "Typhonium vermiforme, commonly known as the snake-root or thread-root plant, is a tropical aroid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, arrow-shaped leaves and a distinctive, fleshy, snake-like tuberous root system. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers, which are followed by spadices that bear bright red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or marshy areas. The plant is noted for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
