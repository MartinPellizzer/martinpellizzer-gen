    "intro": "Taraxacum maurostigma, commonly known as the dark-stemmed dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, dark green leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces a single, hollow, yellow flower head that develops into a distinctive, white, fluffy seed dispersal mechanism. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
