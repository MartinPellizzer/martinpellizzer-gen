    "intro": "Thelypteris rosei, commonly known as the rose fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a reddish hue when young. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Thelypteris rosei is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
