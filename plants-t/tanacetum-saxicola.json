    "intro": "Tanacetum saxicola, commonly known as the alpine tansy, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, yellowish-white composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often emitting a subtle camphor-like scent. Tanacetum saxicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
