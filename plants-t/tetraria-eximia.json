    "intro": "Tetraria eximia, commonly known as the silverleaf tetraria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters, typical of its family. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance and aiding in water conservation. Tetraria eximia is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
