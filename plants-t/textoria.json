    "intro": "Textoria, commonly known as the \"dwarf water lily,\" is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features broad, floating leaves that provide shade and habitat for aquatic life. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, and it plays a role in water filtration. Textoria is often used in ornamental ponds and wetland restoration projects."
