    "intro": "Tetraria macowanii, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers that are typically clustered in dense heads. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Tetraria macowanii is adapted to survive in sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
