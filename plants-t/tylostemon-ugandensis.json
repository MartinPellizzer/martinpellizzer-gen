It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Tylostemon ugandensis is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests."
