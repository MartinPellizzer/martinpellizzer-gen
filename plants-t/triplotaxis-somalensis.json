    "intro": "Triplotaxis somalensis, commonly known as the Somali thorn tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Somalia and Ethiopia. It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, alternate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It is adapted to dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat in semi-arid ecosystems."
