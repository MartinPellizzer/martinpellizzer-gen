    "intro": "Toddalia eugeniifolia, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by round, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. Toddalia eugeniifolia is valued for its durable, heavy wood, which has been traditionally used in carving and furniture making. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in its native range."
