    "intro": "Tridentea marientalensis var. auobensis, commonly known as the Auobens Tridentea, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Namibia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tripartite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to white, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and saline conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
