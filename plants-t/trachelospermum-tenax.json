    "intro": "Trachelospermum tenax, commonly known as the coral vine, is a climbing plant native to Mexico and the southern United States. It is characterized by its vigorous growth habit and clusters of fragrant, coral-colored flowers that bloom throughout the summer. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its stems are often covered in fine, white pubescence, which helps in reducing water loss. Trachelospermum tenax is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
