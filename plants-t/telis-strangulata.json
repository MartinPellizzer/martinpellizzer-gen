    "intro": "Telis strangulata, commonly known as the strangler fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a hemiepiphytic vine that begins its life as an epiphyte growing on the branches of trees. As it grows, it produces aerial roots that descend to the ground, eventually surrounding and engulfing the host tree. The plant's unique growth pattern allows it to access more sunlight and nutrients. Despite its name, the strangler fig does not typically kill its host tree, though it can significantly weaken it over time."
