    "intro": "Tamarix matritensis, commonly known as the Spanish tamarisk, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its feathery, gray-green foliage and small, pink or reddish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid and saline environments. Its branches are often covered in tiny, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. Tamarix matritensis is adapted to coastal and inland areas with poor soil conditions."
