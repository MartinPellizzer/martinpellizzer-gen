It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically narrow and have a pale green to white coloration. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. This subspecies is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage crop for livestock."
