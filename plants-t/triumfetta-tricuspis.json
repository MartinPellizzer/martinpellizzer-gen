    "intro": "Triumfetta tricuspis, commonly known as the three-lobed triumfetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with three lobes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Triumfetta tricuspis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
