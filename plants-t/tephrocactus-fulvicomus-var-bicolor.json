    "intro": "Tephrocactus fulvicomus var. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored sunburst cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of white or pale blue spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and the stems are fleshy, adapted for water storage in arid environments. This variety is prized for its unique coloration and is often cultivated as a decorative cactus in succulent gardens."
