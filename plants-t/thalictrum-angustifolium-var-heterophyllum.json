    "intro": "Thalictrum angustifolium var. heterophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a soft, silvery underside. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in loose, upright inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Its unique foliage and subtle flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
