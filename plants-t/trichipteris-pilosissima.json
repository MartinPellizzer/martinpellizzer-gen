    "intro": "Trichipteris pilosissima, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of fern characterized by its dense, feathery fronds covered in fine, soft hairs. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that aids in its identification. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
