    "intro": "Thesium umbellatum, commonly known as the umbrella thesium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in an umbel, giving it its common name. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Thesium umbellatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
