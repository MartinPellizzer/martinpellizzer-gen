    "intro": "Thesium serratum, commonly known as the serrated thesium, is a flowering plant native to parts of Australia and New Zealand. It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically visited by insects such as flies and beetles. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with serrated edges, giving it its common name. Thesium serratum is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and grasslands."
