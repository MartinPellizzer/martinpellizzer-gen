It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that are often covered in a distinctive white, fuzzy underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters, followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and ornamental horticulture."
