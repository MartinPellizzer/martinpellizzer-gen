    "intro": "Tipularia, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Tipularia species are typically small, herbaceous plants with delicate, often translucent or waxy leaves. They produce intricate, orchid-like flowers that are usually white or pale in color, with a unique, almost ghostly appearance. Due to their rarity and specific habitat requirements, Tipularia species are often found in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests or along stream banks."
