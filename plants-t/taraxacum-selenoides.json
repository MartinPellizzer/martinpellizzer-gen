    "intro": "Taraxacum selenoides, commonly known as the moonflower dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant produces a distinctive, elongated seed head that releases seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. Native to arid regions of North America, it is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
