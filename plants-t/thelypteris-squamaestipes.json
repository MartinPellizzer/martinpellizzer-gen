    "intro": "Thelypteris squamaestipes, commonly known as the scaly-stemmed water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a lush green appearance throughout much of the year."
