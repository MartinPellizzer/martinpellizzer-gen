    "intro": "Tomophyllum macrum, commonly known as the giant sedge, is a striking plant native to the wetlands of New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters, making it one of the tallest sedges in the world. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences composed of numerous small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its wetland habitat. Tomophyllum macrum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species."
