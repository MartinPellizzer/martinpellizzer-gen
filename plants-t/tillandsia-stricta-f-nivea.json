    "intro": "Tillandsia stricta f. nivea, commonly known as the white-flowered air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant that thrives by attaching itself to trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they bloom in a spike that rises from the center of the rosette. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to grow in low-light conditions."
