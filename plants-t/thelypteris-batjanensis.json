It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to the soil. Thelypteris batjanensis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
