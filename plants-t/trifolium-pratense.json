    "intro": "Trifolium pratense, commonly known as red clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in dense clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Red clover is a perennial herb that thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. It is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it valuable in agricultural settings."
