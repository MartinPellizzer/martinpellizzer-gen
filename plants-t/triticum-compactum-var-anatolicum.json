    "intro": "Triticum compactum var. anatolicum, commonly known as Anatolian dwarf wheat, is a small-grained wheat species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stature compared to common wheat. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, glaucous leaves. It is adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient crop in such conditions. Its botanical features make it of interest for both agricultural research and potential use in breeding programs."
