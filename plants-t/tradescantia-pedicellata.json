    "intro": "Tradescantia pedicellata, commonly known as the spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, branching stems with heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with silver or white markings. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Tradescantia pedicellata is also valued for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense ground cover."
