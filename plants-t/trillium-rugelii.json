    "intro": "Trillium rugelii, commonly known as Rugel's trillium, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its three large, waxy, white petals and three sepals that are often a different color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has a short, stout stem with a single, prominent leaf. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, red berries that are dispersed by birds. Trillium rugelii is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific habitat conditions to thrive."
