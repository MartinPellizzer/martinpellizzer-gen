    "intro": "Thymus angustus, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, contribute to its use in herbal medicine and culinary applications."
