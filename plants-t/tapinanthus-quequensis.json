    "intro": "Tapinanthus quequensis, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized root structures. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of South America, particularly in Brazil. The plant produces showy, often fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It lacks true leaves and relies heavily on its host for water and minerals. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat."
