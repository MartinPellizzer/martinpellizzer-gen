    "intro": "Tetraneuris acaulis var. arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona spineflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a low-growing perennial with a rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species for desert environments. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
