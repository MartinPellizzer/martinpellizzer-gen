    "intro": "Tillandsia ensiformis, commonly known as the sword air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. This species is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating to help retain moisture. Tillandsia ensiformis is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
