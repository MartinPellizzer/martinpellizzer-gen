    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 praecellens, commonly known as the silver-leaf linden, is a hybrid deciduous tree belonging to the Tiliaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, pale green leaves that often have a silvery-white underside, giving it its distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. These flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is valued for its shade and ornamental qualities in gardens and landscapes."
