    "intro": "Tavaresia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered tavaresia, is a striking member of the Acanthaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to pink, often with contrasting white or yellow markings. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds and bees, making it an important species in tropical ecosystems. Tavaresia grandiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
