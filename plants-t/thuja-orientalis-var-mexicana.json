    "intro": "Thuja orientalis var. mexicana, commonly known as Mexican arborvitae, is a deciduous conifer native to the central and southern regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that develop into blue-black berries, which are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Due to its slow growth rate, it is often used as a hedge or specimen plant in landscaping."
