    "intro": "Trichopteryx fruticulosa var. perlaxa, commonly known as the silverleaf shrub, is a perennial plant native to the temperate regions of southern Europe. It features slender, woody stems that are covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs, giving it its characteristic appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by tiny, berry-like fruits. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
