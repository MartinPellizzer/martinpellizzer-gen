    "intro": "Taraxacum karakoricum, commonly known as the Karakoram dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, upright stem that bears a yellow flower head. The plant is adapted to cold, alpine environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a pappus, allowing its seeds to be carried by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern in its native habitat."
