    "intro": "Tinus nigrescens, commonly known as the black-barked tree, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of southern Africa. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10 to 15 meters, featuring a straight trunk with a rough, dark bark. The leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptical in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits that are edible for some wildlife. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
