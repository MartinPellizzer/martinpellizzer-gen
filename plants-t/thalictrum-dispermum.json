    "intro": "Thalictrum dispermum, commonly known as the showy avens, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces two types of flowers, with some bearing showy petals and others being more rudimentary, a feature that gives it its specific epithet \"dispermum.\" Thalictrum dispermum is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
