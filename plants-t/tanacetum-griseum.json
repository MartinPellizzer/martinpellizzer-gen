    "intro": "Tanacetum griseum, commonly known as the Russian tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish composite flowers that are clustered in flat-topped inflorescences. Tanacetum griseum is often found in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
