    "intro": "Triticum durum var. heterochromum, commonly known as durum wheat with heterochromatic variation, is a variant of durum wheat characterized by its unique chromosomal structure. This plant is primarily cultivated for its high gluten content, which is essential for making pasta and other durum-based products. Its botanical features include semi-dwarf stature, hard kernel, and a short growth cycle, making it well-suited for Mediterranean climates. The heterochromatin in its genome may influence its genetic stability and agronomic traits. It is a valuable crop for both food and industrial applications due to its nutritional profile and adaptability."
