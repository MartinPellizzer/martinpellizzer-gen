It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a distinctive whitish, powdery coating, giving it a glossy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, purple or blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Teucrium pruinosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
