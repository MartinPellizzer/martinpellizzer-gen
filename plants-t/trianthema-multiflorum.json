    "intro": "Trianthema multiflorum, commonly known as the many-flowered trianthema, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features fleshy, cylindrical stems and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Trianthema multiflorum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
