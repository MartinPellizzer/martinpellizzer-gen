    "intro": "Terpsichore dependens, commonly known as the hanging lady's slipper, is a unique orchid species characterized by its distinctive floral structure. It features a striking, pouch-like lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns and vibrant colors. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, Terpsichore dependens is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
