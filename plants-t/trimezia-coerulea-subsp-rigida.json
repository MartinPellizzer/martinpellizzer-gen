    "intro": "Trimezia coerulea subsp. rigida, commonly known as the rigid blue trimezia, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. The subspecies rigida is distinguished by its more rigid and upright growth habit compared to other varieties of Trimezia."
