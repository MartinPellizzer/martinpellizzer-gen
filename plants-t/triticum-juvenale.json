    "intro": "Triticum juvenale, commonly known as the wild wheat or dwarf wheat, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small stature, typically growing to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish glumes. Its seeds are similar in appearance to those of cultivated wheat but are generally smaller and less productive. Triticum juvenale is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
