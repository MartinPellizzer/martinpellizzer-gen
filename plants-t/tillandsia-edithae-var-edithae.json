    "intro": "Tillandsia edithae var. edithae, commonly known as the Edith's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks. The plant features a rosette of narrow, strap-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
