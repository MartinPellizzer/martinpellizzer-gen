    "intro": "Taxillus ovalis, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often inconspicuous, followed by berries that are typically red or yellow. It is native to regions of India, Southeast Asia, and parts of Africa. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant stress to its host trees if left unchecked."
