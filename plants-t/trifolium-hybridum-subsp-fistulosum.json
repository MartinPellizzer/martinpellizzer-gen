    "intro": "Trifolium hybridum subsp. fistulosum, commonly known as the slender clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces slender, cylindrical seed pods that contain small, rounded seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in landscaping."
