    "intro": "Tricliceras brevicaule var. brevicaule, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tricliceras, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
