    "intro": "Tragacantha calabrica, commonly known as the Calabrian tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant produces a valuable gum, known as tragacanth, which has been used historically in medicine and as a thickening agent. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
