    "intro": "Trapa longicarpa var. mammeata, commonly known as the long-seeded water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves and spiny, spherical fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving rivers. Its reproductive structures are adapted for water dispersal, enhancing its spread in aquatic ecosystems. The leaves are typically divided into narrow, ribbon-like segments, which help in buoyancy and photosynthesis."
