    "intro": "Tripogandra silvatica, commonly known as the forest tripogandra, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora. The plant's botanical characteristics make it an important component of forest ecosystems, supporting various insect and fungal species."
