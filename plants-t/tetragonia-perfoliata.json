It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are edible and have a slightly bitter taste, similar to that of spinach. Tetragonia perfoliata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
