    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. spathulatus, commonly known as broad-leaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features aromatic, ovate to broadly elliptic leaves with a woolly texture, and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and fragrant foliage make it a popular choice for culinary and ornamental use. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
