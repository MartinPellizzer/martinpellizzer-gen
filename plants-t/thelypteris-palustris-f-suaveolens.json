    "intro": "Thelypteris palustris f. suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented field fern, is a fern species native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often tinged with a pale green or reddish hue. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Its fragrant, citrus-like scent is released when the fronds are disturbed, making it distinctive in its environment. This fern thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks."
