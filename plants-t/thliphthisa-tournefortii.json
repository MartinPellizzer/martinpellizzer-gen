    "intro": "Thliphthisa tournefortii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is a perennial herb that typically grows from 10 to 30 centimeters in height, with hairy stems and basal leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round seed capsules. It is adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil. Thliphthisa tournefortii is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is considered a hardy species for xeriscaping."
