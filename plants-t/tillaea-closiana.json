    "intro": "Tillaea closiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tillaea, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in sunny, arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
