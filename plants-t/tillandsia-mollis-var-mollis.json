    "intro": "Tillandsia mollis var. mollis, commonly known as the silver vernal, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup to collect water. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and light absorption. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental value."
