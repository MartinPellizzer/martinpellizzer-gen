    "intro": "Tropitria crassula, commonly known as the stonecrop or sempervivum, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant typically grows in rock crevices or on slopes, where it forms dense mats or small clumps. Its compact growth habit and ability to propagate through offsets make it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Tropitria crassula is also known for its resilience to drought and cold temperatures, making it a hardy ornamental plant."
