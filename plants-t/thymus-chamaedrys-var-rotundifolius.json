It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant groundcover. Its aromatic foliage is often used in cooking and herbal remedies."
