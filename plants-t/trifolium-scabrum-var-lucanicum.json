    "intro": "Trifolium scabrum var. lucanicum, commonly known as the Lucanian hairy clover, is a variant of the hairy vetch, characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves and hairy stems. It is native to southern Europe, particularly the Balkans and parts of Italy, and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Trifolium scabrum var. lucanicum is a hardy perennial that plays a role in soil stabilization and supports pollinator populations."
