It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Kangaroo grass is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
