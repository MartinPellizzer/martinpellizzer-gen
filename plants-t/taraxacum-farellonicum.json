    "intro": "Taraxacum farellonicum, commonly known as the Farellon's dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features a basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces, and it produces a distinctive yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy white pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
