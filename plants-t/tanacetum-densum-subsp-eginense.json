    "intro": "Tanacetum densum subsp. eginense, commonly known as the Eginian dense tansy, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense arrangement of small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces numerous small, daisy-like flowers with white ray florets and yellow disc florets, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
