    "intro": "Thelypteris spinulosa var. dilatata, commonly known as the broad-leafed shield fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds and reproductive structures. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to regions in Southeast Asia, including parts of China, Japan, and the Philippines. The plant features bipinnate fronds with elongated, serrated pinnae, and the sori are clustered in elongated, linear structures on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. The varietal form, dilatata, is distinguished by its broader and more elongated leaflets compared to the typical variety."
