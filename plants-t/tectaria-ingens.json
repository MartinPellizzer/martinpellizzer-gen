    "intro": "Tectaria ingens, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor to trees and absorb moisture from the air. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Tectaria ingens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
