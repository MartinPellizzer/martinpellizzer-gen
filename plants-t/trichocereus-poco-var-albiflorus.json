    "intro": "Trichocereus poco var. albiflorus, commonly known as the White Flower Cactus, is a species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and clusters of white, nocturnal flowers that bloom during the night. The plant has a spiny exterior with areoles that bear both spines and flowers. It thrives in arid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and flowering habits, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
