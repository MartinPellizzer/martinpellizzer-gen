    "intro": "Tetranthera glauca, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb with slender, branching stems that often appear to be covered in a fine blue-gray haze. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. Tetranthera glauca is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
