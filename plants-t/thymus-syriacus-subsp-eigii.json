    "intro": "Thymus syriacus subsp. eigii, commonly known as Syrian thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Eastern Mediterranean. It features compact, woody stems and small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale pink to lavender flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications."
