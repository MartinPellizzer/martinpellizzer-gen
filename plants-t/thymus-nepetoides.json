    "intro": "Thymus nepetoides, commonly known as cat thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has aromatic, grey-green foliage that is often used in herbal teas and as a culinary herb. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Thymus nepetoides is also valued for its ability to repel certain pests, including cats, due to its strong scent."
