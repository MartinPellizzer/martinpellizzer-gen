It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range from white to pink and are often fragrant. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and prefers well-drained conditions. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
