It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow and green foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a star-like appearance. Triacma thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and botanical collections."
