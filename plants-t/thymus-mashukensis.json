    "intro": "Thymus mashukensis, commonly known as the Mashuk thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic, tiny, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat."
