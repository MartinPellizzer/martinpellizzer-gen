    "intro": "Tragacantha tetragonocarpa, commonly known as the quadrangular tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its woody stems and small, alternate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiny pods containing seeds. Its latex, similar to that of other tragacanth species, has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural gum. The botanical features of Tragacantha tetragonocarpa make it an important species in both ecological and pharmacological contexts."
