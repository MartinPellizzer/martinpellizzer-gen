    "intro": "Turbinicarpus \u00d7 campanularis, commonly known as the hybrid moon cactus, is a succulent plant belonging to the Cactaceae family. It is a hybrid between Turbinicarpus subulatus and Turbinicarpus campanularis, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant is characterized by its swollen, bulbous stem that resembles a moon, hence its common name. It typically features a green body with a white or light-colored top, which is a result of the grafting process used to produce the hybrid. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts."
