    "intro": "Tyria salapa, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, clustered blooms in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom during the cooler months. Tyria salapa thrives in rocky soils and requires ample sunlight, making it well adapted to alpine environments. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important species in the study of high-altitude flora."
