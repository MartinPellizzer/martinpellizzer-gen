    "intro": "Triplasandra kaalae, commonly known as the K\u0101hului tree, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on the island of Moloka\u02bbi in Hawaii. It is a small, evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of about 5 to 10 meters. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy, dark green upper surface. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by birds. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Triplasandra kaalae is considered critically endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts."
