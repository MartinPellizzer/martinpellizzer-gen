    "intro": "Trifolium filiforme var. minimum, commonly known as the dwarf clover, is a small, low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, appearing in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a ground cover or for its ecological benefits to pollinators."
