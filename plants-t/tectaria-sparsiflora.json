    "intro": "Tectaria sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori. Tectaria sparsiflora is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are typically covered with a thin, protective layer called a indusium."
