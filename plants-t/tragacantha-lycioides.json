    "intro": "Tragacantha lycioides, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape, with dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically small and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration. Tragacantha lycioides is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
