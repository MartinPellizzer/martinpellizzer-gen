    "intro": "Tragacantha polyacantha, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and small, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellowish flowers followed by pods containing a sticky resin known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and industry. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various insects and birds in its native range."
