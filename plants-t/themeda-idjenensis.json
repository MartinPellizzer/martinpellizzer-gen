    "intro": "Themeda idjenensis, commonly known as the Idjenensis grass, is a perennial grass species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or marshy environments. Themeda idjenensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
