    "intro": "Therogeron, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces striking white or pale green flowers with intricate, lip-like structures that aid in pollination. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is classified as endangered. Conservation efforts focus on protecting its wetland habitats and ensuring its survival in the wild."
