    "intro": "Thlaspi rotundifolium var. limosellifolium, commonly known as the cushion rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or alpine soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in arid landscapes."
