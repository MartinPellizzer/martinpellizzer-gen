    "intro": "Triticum prostratum, commonly known as prostrate wheat, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit, with slender stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
