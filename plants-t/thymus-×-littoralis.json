It is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic, small, oval leaves that are densely packed on the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Thymus \u00d7 littoralis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate salty air and wind."
