    "intro": "Taraxacum steenhoffianum, commonly known as the Steenhoff's dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces yellow ray florets that develop into fluffy white seeds with pappus for wind dispersal. It is native to southern Africa and thrives in dry, open habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
