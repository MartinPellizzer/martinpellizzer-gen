    "intro": "Toxocarpus palghatensis, commonly known as the Palghat waxflower, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or white in color. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Toxocarpus palghatensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
