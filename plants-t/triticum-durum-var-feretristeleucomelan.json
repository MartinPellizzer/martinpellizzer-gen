    "intro": "Triticum durum var. feretristeleucomelan, commonly known as a rare variant of durum wheat, is characterized by its unique botanical features. It exhibits a compact growth habit with shorter stems and a higher number of spikelets compared to standard durum wheat varieties. The leaves are typically narrower and have a distinct glaucous-blue hue, which is a distinguishing trait. Its grains are hard and have a high protein content, contributing to its use in pasta and semolina production. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic diversity and potential for breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience."
