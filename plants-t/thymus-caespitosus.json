    "intro": "Thymus caespitosus, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny pink or white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover. Its compact growth habit and medicinal properties have made it a valued plant in both horticulture and traditional herbal medicine."
