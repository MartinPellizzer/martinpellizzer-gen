    "intro": "Triticum urartu var. binartulutriru, commonly known as the wild emmer wheat, is a diploid species native to the Fertile Crescent. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and tough, straw-like stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two-rowed grains, which are typically light yellow in color. It is an important ancestor of modern wheat species due to its genetic diversity and adaptability. This variety is often studied for its role in wheat domestication and its potential for improving modern wheat varieties through breeding programs."
