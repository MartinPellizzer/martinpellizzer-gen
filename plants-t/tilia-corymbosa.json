    "intro": "Tilia corymbosa, commonly known as the small-leaf lime, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of other lime species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in dense cymes, which bloom in early summer. Its fruit is a small, spherical nut enclosed in a woody husk. Tilia corymbosa is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
