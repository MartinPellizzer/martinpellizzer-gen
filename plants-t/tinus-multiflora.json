It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Tinus multiflora is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
