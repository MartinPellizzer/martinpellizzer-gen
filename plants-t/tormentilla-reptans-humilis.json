    "intro": "Tormentilla reptans humilis, commonly known as creeping willow or dwarf willow, is a low-growing shrub native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or colonies. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. Tormentilla reptans humilis thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats."
