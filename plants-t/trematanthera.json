    "intro": "Trematanthera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with small, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly shapes. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Trematanthera is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
