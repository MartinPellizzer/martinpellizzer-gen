It is characterized by its fine, soft leaves and compact growth habit, making it suitable for ornamental use. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers, and its seeds are typically used in traditional medicine. Triticum molle thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, though it can tolerate partial shade. It is also valued for its potential nutritional properties and is sometimes used in herbal remedies."
