    "intro": "Touchiroa havilandii, commonly known as the Haviland's touchiroa, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in specific regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories, and is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
