    "intro": "Tolmachevia, commonly known as desert star or desert globemallow, is a genus of flowering plants native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These plants are characterized by their striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often resembling stars or globes. Tolmachevia species are typically shrubs or subshrubs with thick, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to arid environments. They possess a deep root system that allows them to survive in dry, sandy soils. The genus is part of the Malvaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like hibiscus and cotton."
