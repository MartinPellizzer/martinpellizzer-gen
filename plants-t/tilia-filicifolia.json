    "intro": "Tilia filicifolia, commonly known as the fern-leaved lime, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble fern fronds, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by bees. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Tilia filicifolia is often found in moist, shady habitats and is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits."
