    "intro": "Tillandsia santiagoensis f. adpressa, commonly known as the Santiagoensis Tillandsia, is a unique epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. This variety is characterized by its dense, overlapping foliage that forms a compact rosette, allowing it to efficiently capture moisture from the air. The leaves are typically narrow and pointed, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden within the foliage, adding to its subtle beauty. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is a rare and endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
