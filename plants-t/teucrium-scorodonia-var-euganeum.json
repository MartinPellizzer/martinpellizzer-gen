    "intro": "Teucrium scorodonia var. euganeum, commonly known as the Sicilian germander, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in summer. Its aromatic foliage and medicinal properties have made it historically significant in herbal medicine. The variety euganeum is distinguished by its unique floral structure and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other Teucrium species."
