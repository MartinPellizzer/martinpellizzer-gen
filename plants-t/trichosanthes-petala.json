It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, white flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces fruits that are typically green and turn yellow or orange when ripe, though the fruit is often harvested before full maturity. Its botanical classification places it in the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and pumpkins. The plant is noted for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
