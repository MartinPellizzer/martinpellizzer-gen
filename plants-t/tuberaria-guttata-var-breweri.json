    "intro": "Tuberaria guttata var. breweri, commonly known as the Arizona milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Its foliage is covered in small, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat."
