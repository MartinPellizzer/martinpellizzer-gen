    "intro": "Tephrosia retusa, commonly known as the white tephrosia, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its seeds are encased in small, hairy pods that split open when mature to release the seeds. Tephrosia retusa is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock."
