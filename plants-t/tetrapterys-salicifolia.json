    "intro": "Tetrapterys salicifolia, commonly known as the willowleaf tetrapterys, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often mistaken for willow leaves due to their similar appearance. Its small, clustered flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds. Tetrapterys salicifolia is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
