    "intro": "Toisusu, commonly known as the sacred lotus of Japan, is a aquatic plant native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense colonies. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, spongy stems. Its flowers, which bloom in summer, are typically pink or white and have a strong, sweet fragrance. Toisusu plays an important role in traditional Japanese culture and is often symbolized in art and literature."
