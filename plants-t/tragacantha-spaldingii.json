    "intro": "Tragacantha spaldingii, commonly known as the Spalding's tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a sticky resin, similar to gum arabic, which has been historically used in various traditional applications. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas."
