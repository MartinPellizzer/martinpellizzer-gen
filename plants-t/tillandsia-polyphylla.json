    "intro": "Tillandsia polyphylla, commonly known as the silver vane air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white trichomes. These trichomes help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Native to Central and South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
