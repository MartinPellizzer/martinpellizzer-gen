    "intro": "Trisetum pourretii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and tufted growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Trisetum pourretii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
