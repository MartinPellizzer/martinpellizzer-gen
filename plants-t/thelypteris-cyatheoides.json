    "intro": "Thelypteris cyatheoides, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The fronds are dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in structure and function."
