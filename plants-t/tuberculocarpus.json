    "intro": "Tuberculocarpus, commonly known as the cushion lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to the high-altitude regions of South America. These plants are characterized by their compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps them survive in harsh, cold environments. They produce showy, often fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the summer months. The leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette, aiding in water retention. Tuberculocarpus species are popular among rock garden enthusiasts due to their ornamental value and unique appearance."
