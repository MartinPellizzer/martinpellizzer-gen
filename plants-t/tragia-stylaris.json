    "intro": "Tragia stylaris, commonly known as the slender tragia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Tragia stylaris is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in semi-arid conditions."
