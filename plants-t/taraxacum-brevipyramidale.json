    "intro": "Taraxacum brevipyramidale, commonly known as the short-pyramid dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a distinctive, rounded seed head that disperses its seeds via the wind. It is typically found in grassy areas and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. Its botanical features make it a common yet often overlooked member of the dandelion genus."
