    "intro": "Tillaea pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf tillaea, is a small, mat-forming succulent native to arid regions of southern Africa. It has fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is an ideal plant for low-maintenance landscaping in dry climates."
