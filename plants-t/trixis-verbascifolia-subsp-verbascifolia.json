    "intro": "Trixis verbascifolia subsp. verbascifolia, commonly known as the desert mullein, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
