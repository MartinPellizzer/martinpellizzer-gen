    "intro": "Tephrosia zombensis, commonly known as the zombie bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species in its native habitat. However, due to its rarity and limited distribution, it is considered a lesser-known but ecologically significant plant."
