These plants are characterized by their rosettes of velvety, dark green leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Treleasea species are typically small, herbaceous perennials that thrive in humid, shaded environments. They are popular houseplants due to their attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements. The flowers are often pollinated by small insects, and the plants produce capsule fruits containing numerous seeds."
