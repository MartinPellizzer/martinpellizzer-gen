    "intro": "Trigonella prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate fenugreek, is a low-growing annual herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by lens-shaped pods containing several seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often found in dry, disturbed soils. Trigonella prostrata is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
