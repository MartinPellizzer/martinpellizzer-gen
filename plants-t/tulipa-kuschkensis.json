    "intro": "Tulipa kuschkensis, commonly known as the Kuschkensis tulip, is a perennial bulbous plant native to Central Asia. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange, typically blooming in spring. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists."
