It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically arranged in umbels. It is native to certain regions of South America and thrives in moist, temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of botanical circles."
