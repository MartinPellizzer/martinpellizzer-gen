    "intro": "Thalictrum flavum var. rufinerve, commonly known as the red-veined meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically green with prominent red or brown veins. The plant produces showy, drooping clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and subtle floral display."
