    "intro": "Triticum sphaerococcum var. kostoffii, commonly known as the spherical wheat, is a rare and unique variant of wheat characterized by its distinctive globular grain structure. This plant belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. Its grains are typically smaller and more compact compared to conventional wheat varieties, which contributes to its unique botanical features. The plant exhibits a short stature with dense, compact inflorescences, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers."
