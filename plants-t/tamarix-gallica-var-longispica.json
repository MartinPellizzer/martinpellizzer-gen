    "intro": "Tamarix gallica var. longispica, commonly known as the long-spined sea buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, yellow-orange berries that are rich in nutrients. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
