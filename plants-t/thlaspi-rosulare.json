It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with four petals, typical of the mustard family. It is often found in rocky or disturbed soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. Thlaspi rosulare is also known for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it a potential indicator plant for soil contamination."
