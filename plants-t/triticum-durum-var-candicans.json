    "intro": "Triticum durum var. candicans, commonly known as durum wheat with varietal candicans, is a variety of durum wheat characterized by its hard, high-protein grains. This plant is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is primarily cultivated for its use in pasta and semolina production. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and compact spikelets that contain the grain heads. The plant is adapted to temperate climates and requires a long growing season with adequate sunlight and water. Its botanical features make it well-suited for regions with moderate to high rainfall and cooler temperatures."
