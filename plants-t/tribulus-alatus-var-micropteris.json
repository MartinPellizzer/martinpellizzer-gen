It is a low-growing annual herb with distinctive spiny fruits that contain four seeds. The plant has palmate leaves with three to five lobes and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Due to its spiny characteristics, it is sometimes used as a natural deterrent in gardens."
