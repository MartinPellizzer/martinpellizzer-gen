    "intro": "Tragopogon lithuanicus, commonly known as the Lithuanian goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to Central Europe and parts of Russia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by a tuft of bristly seeds for wind dispersal. Tragopogon lithuanicus is known for its hairy stems and basal leaves, which are often used in traditional herbal medicine."
