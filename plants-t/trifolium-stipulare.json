    "intro": "Trifolium stipulare, commonly known as the stipulate clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters. Trifolium stipulare is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through its root nodules, making it an important plant in soil enrichment."
