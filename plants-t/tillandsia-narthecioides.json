    "intro": "Tillandsia narthecioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
