    "intro": "Thelypteris ponapeana, commonly known as the Ponape holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, including the Caroline Islands. It is a medium-sized fern with slender, arching fronds that are typically less than a meter in length. The plant's leaves are bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and they are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. Thelypteris ponapeana thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in coastal or humid forest areas. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
