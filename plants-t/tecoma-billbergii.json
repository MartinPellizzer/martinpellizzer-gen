    "intro": "Tecoma billbergii, commonly known as yellow bells, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring a woody stem and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of showy, yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer and early autumn. These flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and the plant produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds. Tecoma billbergii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil types."
