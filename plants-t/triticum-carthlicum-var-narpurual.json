    "intro": "Triticum carthlicum var. narpurual, commonly known as the Narpurual wheat, is a lesser-known variant of the wheat species with unique botanical characteristics. It is a annual grass that typically grows in temperate climates, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant features narrow, blade-like leaves and produces spikelets that bear small, hard grains. Its seeds are encased in a tough hull, which requires specialized processing for use in flour. This variety is valued for its resilience to certain environmental stresses, making it of interest in agricultural research."
