    "intro": "Thymus pastoralis, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, fragrant leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces tiny pink or white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its dense growth habit makes it an excellent ground cover plant in gardens and landscapes. Thymus pastoralis is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and versatile choice for various climates."
