    "intro": "Tongoloa dunnii, commonly known as the Hawaiian mountain ginger, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of Hawaii. It is characterized by its aromatic, rhizomatous growth habit and possesses long, narrow leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its restricted habitat, Tongoloa dunnii is considered a rare and endangered species."
