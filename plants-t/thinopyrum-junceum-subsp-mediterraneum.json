    "intro": "Thinopyrum junceum subsp. mediterraneum, commonly known as Mediterranean wild rye, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and North Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, slopes, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
