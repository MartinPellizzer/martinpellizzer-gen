    "intro": "Triglochin protuberans, commonly known as the woolly spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize the soil in aquatic environments. Triglochin protuberans is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
