    "intro": "Tinus pellucida, commonly known as the glassy sunflower, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features elongated, narrow leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving them a glassy appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with prominent, tubular corollas that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often growing in open grasslands or along rocky outcrops. Its unique leaf structure and showy blooms make it a distinctive and ornamental species in its native habitat."
