    "intro": "Thelypteris scalaris, commonly known as the scalloped shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds with a scalloped margin that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Thelypteris scalaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
