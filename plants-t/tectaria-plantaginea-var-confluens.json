It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The fronds are typically broad and have a distinctive, leathery texture, with a pale green to yellowish hue on the underside. This variety is native to tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a notable species in the study of fern botany."
