    "intro": "Toxicoscordion salinum, commonly known as saltweed, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in saline environments. It belongs to the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish flowers. The plant produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which disperse its seeds through wind. It is native to coastal areas and salt marshes in Australia and is often found in regions with high soil salinity. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by grazing animals."
