    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 porcii f. juranyianus, commonly known as the Juranyi's thyme, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to the Carpathian region. It features aromatic, narrow, gray-green leaves that are densely packed and emit a strong thyme scent when crushed. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
