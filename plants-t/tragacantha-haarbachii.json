    "intro": "Tragacantha haarbachii, commonly known as the Persian tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Iran and Afghanistan. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and woody, thorny stems. The plant produces a viscous gum, known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a thickening agent. Its adaptations to drought include deep root systems and reduced leaf surfaces, enabling it to thrive in harsh, semi-desert environments."
