    "intro": "Trifolium eriosphaerum, commonly known as the woolly trefoil, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Trifolium eriosphaerum is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
