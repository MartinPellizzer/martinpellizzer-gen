    "intro": "Trifolium piorkowskii, commonly known as the Piorkowski's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Native to certain regions of Europe, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
