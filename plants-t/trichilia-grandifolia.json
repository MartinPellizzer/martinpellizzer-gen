    "intro": "Trichilia grandifolia, commonly known as African shea tree, is a tropical tree native to Africa, particularly found in countries like Ghana, Nigeria, and Sudan. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces yellowish flowers that are followed by woody pods containing oily seeds. These seeds are the source of shea butter, which is widely used in cosmetics and skincare products. The plant also plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
