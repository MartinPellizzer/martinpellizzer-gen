It features aromatic, narrow to broadly elliptic leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This subspecies is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, similar to other thyme species."
