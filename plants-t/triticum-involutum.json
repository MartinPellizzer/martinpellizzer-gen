    "intro": "Triticum involutum, commonly known as the rolled ryegrass, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, rolled leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides, showing adaptability to various environmental conditions. Its flowering spikes are usually slender and bear small, spikelet-like flowers. Triticum involutum is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic relationship to cultivated rye and its potential role in ecological succession."
