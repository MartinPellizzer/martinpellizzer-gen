    "intro": "Thelypteris didymosora, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the fern family."
