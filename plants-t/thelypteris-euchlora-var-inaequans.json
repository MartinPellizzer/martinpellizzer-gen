    "intro": "Thelypteris euchlora var. inaequans, commonly known as the unequal fern, is a variant of the broadleaf fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dimorphic fronds, with the fertile leaves differing in shape and size from the sterile ones. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates."
