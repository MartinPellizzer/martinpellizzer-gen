    "intro": "Trillium camschatcense var. kurilense, commonly known as the Kuril white trillium, is a rare and striking plant native to the Kuril Islands. It is characterized by its large, white, showy flowers with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in early spring. The plant has three broad, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a whorl at the base. It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments and is often found in rocky or humus-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
