It belongs to the family Pandanaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which eventually develop into fibrous, pineapple-like fruits. Tetraplasandra oahuensis is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of Hawaii and thrives in well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various native fauna."
