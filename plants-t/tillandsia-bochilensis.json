    "intro": "Tillandsia bochilensis, commonly known as the Bochilensis air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage consists of long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to capture moisture from the air. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
