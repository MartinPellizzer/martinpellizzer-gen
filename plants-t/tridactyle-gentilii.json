    "intro": "Tridactyle gentilii, commonly known as the Gentilii's tridactyle, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in an umbel, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
