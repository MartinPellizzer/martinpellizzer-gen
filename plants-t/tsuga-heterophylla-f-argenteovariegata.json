It is characterized by its striking variegated foliage, featuring white and yellow markings on its needle-like leaves. This form exhibits a slower growth rate compared to the typical western hemlock, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces. The plant retains its variegation throughout the growing season, adding visual interest to landscapes. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often used as an ornamental plant in horticulture."
