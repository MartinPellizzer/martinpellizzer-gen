It is characterized by its distinctive flaky, reddish-brown bark and its ability to tolerate wetland conditions. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, typical of the cypress family. Its leaves are scale-like and arranged in opposite pairs, giving it a unique appearance. This variety is often found in riparian zones and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
