    "intro": "Tessmannianthus calcaratus, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, orchid-like flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish-white in color. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tessmannianthus calcaratus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
