It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid forests or on rock faces. Its fronds are typically narrow and have a distinct, feathery appearance, with a glossy green surface. The sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
