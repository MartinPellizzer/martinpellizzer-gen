    "intro": "Trichomanes japonicum, commonly known as Japanese water fern, is a member of the water fern family (Pteridaceae). It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic fern that typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are usually submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are often anchored to the substrate, and the leaves are characterized by their delicate, thread-like structure. Trichomanes japonicum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
