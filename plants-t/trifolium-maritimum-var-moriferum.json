    "intro": "Trifolium maritimum var. moriferum, commonly known as the sea clover, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. This variety is adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant found in maritime environments. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion due to its deep root system. The plant is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
