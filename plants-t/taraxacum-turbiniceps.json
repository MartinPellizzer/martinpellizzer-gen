    "intro": "Taraxacum turbiniceps, commonly known as the turbinated dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, turbinated (spiral-shaped) seed head, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. It produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by the characteristic fluffy seeds. The leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, typical of the genus Taraxacum."
