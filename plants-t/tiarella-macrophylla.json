    "intro": "Tiarella macrophylla, commonly known as the Japanese foamflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and delicate floral display."
