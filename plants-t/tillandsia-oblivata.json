    "intro": "Tillandsia oblivata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a bromeliad native to the tropical forests of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its pale green, strap-like leaves that form a rosette and its delicate, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
