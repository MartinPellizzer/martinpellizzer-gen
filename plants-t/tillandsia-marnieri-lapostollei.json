    "intro": "Tillandsia marnieri-lapostollei, commonly known as the Lapostolle air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale pink. This species is valued for its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
