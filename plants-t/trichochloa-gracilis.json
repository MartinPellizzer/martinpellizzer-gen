It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and along water bodies. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Trichochloa gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
