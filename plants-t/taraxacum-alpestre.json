    "intro": "Taraxacum alpestre, commonly known as alpine dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, aiding in its spread across rocky and alpine habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates, often found at elevations above 1,500 meters. Taraxacum alpestre is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
