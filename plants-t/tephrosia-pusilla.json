    "intro": "Tephrosia pusilla, commonly known as dwarf tephrosia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 30 centimeters and features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, often blooming during the rainy season. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils. Tephrosia pusilla is also valued for its potential medicinal properties and use in traditional herbal remedies."
