    "intro": "Trachyandra ensifolia, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, sword-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky substrates. Trachyandra ensifolia is well adapted to arid conditions and can thrive in full sun."
