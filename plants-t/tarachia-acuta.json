It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that branch into clusters of small, spiny, globose fruits. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes. Tarachia acuta plays a vital role in desert ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
