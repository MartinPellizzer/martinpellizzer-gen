    "intro": "Triticum dicoccoides subsp. palestinicum, commonly known as the Palestinian emmer wheat, is a wild relative of modern wheat species. It is characterized by its compact, spiky inflorescence and small, hard grains that are adapted to arid environments. This subspecies is native to the Levant region, including parts of modern-day Palestine, Jordan, and Syria. Its genome contains genetic diversity that is valuable for breeding programs aiming to improve drought tolerance and disease resistance in cultivated wheat. The plant typically grows in rocky or semi-arid soils and has been historically used in traditional agricultural systems."
