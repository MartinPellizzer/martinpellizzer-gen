    "intro": "Taraxacum bipinnatifidum, commonly known as the Japanese dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly Japan, and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, upright stem that terminates in a yellow flower head, which develops into a white, fluffy seed head. It is often found in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and forest clearings. Taraxacum bipinnatifidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
