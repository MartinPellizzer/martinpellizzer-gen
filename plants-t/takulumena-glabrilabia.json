    "intro": "Takulumena glabrilabia, commonly known as the smooth-labied takulumena, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers with four petals. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not widely cultivated. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its family."
