    "intro": "Tragopyrum rotundifolium, commonly known as the roundleaf thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, basal rosette of leaves that are rounded and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spherical inflorescence. Its leaves and stems are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, bristly hairs, providing a distinctive texture. Tragopyrum rotundifolium is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in sunny, open habitats."
