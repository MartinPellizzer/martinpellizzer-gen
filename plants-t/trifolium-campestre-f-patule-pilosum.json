    "intro": "Trifolium campestre f. patule-pilosum, commonly known as the hairy-leaved white clover, is a variant of the common white clover. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically three-lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in nitrogen fixation in agricultural settings."
