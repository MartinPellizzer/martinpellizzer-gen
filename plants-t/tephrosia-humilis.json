    "intro": "Tephrosia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf tephrosia, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or pea family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. It produces small, yellowish-green pods that contain several seeds, and it has been used traditionally in some regions for its medicinal properties. Its ecological role includes nitrogen fixation, which benefits soil fertility in its native habitats."
