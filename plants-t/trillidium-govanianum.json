It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
