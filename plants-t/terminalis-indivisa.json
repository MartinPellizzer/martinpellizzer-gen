    "intro": "Terminalis indivisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fern, is a species characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds. The plant features a simple, unbranched structure with small, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a tight spiral. Its rhizome is short and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across moist, shaded environments. Terminalis indivisa thrives in humid climates and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Botanically, it is classified within the family Polypodiaceae, known for its diverse and often epiphytic members."
