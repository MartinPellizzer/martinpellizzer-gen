It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, toothed leaves and a hollow, ridged stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The flower develops into a ball of white, wind-dispersed seeds, a feature that aids in its widespread distribution. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas. This plant is also noted for its medicinal properties, with its leaves and roots used in traditional herbal remedies."
