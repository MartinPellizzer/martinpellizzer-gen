    "intro": "Tillandsia bandensis var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. It produces small, bell-shaped inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
