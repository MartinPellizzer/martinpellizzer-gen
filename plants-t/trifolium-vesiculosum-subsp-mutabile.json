    "intro": "Trifolium vesiculosum subsp. mutabile, commonly known as the variable bubble clover, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and have a distinctive yellowish-green color. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its variable morphology, it is sometimes confused with other Trifolium species, making it a subject of taxonomic interest."
