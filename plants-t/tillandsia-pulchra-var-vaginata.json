    "intro": "Tillandsia pulchra var. vaginata, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name, with leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on air and water for nutrients rather than soil. Its inflorescence produces vibrant, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
