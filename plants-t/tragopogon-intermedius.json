    "intro": "Tragopogon intermedius, commonly known as the yellow goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow ray florets and a tuft of bristly hairs at the tip of its flowering head. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing small, seed-filled flowers that are dispersed by the wind. Tragopogon intermedius is often found in hybrid populations with other Tragopogon species, leading to genetic diversity in its populations."
