It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive triangular-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
