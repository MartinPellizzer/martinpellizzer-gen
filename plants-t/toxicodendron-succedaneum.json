    "intro": "Toxicodendron succedaneum, commonly known as poison ivy, is a flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a staggered pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and is known for its toxic sap, which contains urushiol, a potent allergen. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, fields, and along roadsides. Due to its ability to cause severe skin rashes, it is often considered a noxious weed in many regions."
