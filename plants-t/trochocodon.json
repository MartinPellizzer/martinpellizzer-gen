    "intro": "Trochocodon, commonly known as the starfruit or carambola, is a tropical fruit-bearing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive five-pointed star shape when sliced, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers that develop into the edible, acidic fruit. Its leaves are heart-shaped and glossy, while the fruit's skin is thin and has a slightly rough texture. Trochocodon thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its unique appearance and flavor."
