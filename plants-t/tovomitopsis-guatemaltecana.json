    "intro": "Tovomitopsis guatemaltecana, commonly known as the Guatemalan tovomitopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Guatemala. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, preferring well-drained and sunny conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
