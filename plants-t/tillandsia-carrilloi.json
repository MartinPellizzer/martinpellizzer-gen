    "intro": "Tillandsia carrilloi, commonly known as the Carrillo's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, adapting it to its often arid environment. Its flowers are typically small and pale, with a distinctive structure that aids in pollination by insects. Tillandsia carrilloi is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
