    "intro": "Teline medicagioides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep root system, which helps it thrive in dry and poor soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen. Teline medicagioides is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
