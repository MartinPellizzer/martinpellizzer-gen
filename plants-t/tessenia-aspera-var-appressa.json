    "intro": "Tessenia aspera var. appressa, commonly known as the rough tessenia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it thrive in its natural habitat. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and possess a rough texture, contributing to its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered near the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
