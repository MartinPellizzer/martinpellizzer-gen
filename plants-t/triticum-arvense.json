    "intro": "[WRONG START] Triticem arvense, commonly known as goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Poaceae family and typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences bearing small, pale grains. Triticum arvense is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to thrive in various soil conditions. Its botanical features make it an important study subject in plant ecology and weed science."
