    "intro": "Trichilia floribunda, commonly known as the white flame tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a broad, spreading crown. Its leaves are odd-pinnate, consisting of several pairs of lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces large, showy white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitats."
