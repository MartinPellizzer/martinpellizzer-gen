    "intro": "Trichera bohemica, commonly known as the Bohemian trichera, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires well-drained, loamy soil to thrive. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often releasing a subtle scent when crushed. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Trichera bohemica is considered a species of conservation concern."
