    "intro": "Taraxacum fulvum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the dandelion family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and deeply lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are followed by a distinctive seed head that disperses seeds via the wind. Taraxacum fulvum is often considered a weed but can also serve as a food source for various insects and small animals."
