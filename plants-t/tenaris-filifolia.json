    "intro": "Tenaris filifolia, commonly known as the threadleaf desert willow, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Tenaris filifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
