    "intro": "Tephrosia procumbens, commonly known as creeping tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically forms dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and are usually pubescent. Tephrosia procumbens is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
