    "intro": "Triticum puberulum, commonly known as the rough wheat or slender wheat, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish florets. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in open, sunny habitats. While not widely cultivated for grain, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological adaptability and historical significance."
