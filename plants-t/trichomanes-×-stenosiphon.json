    "intro": "Trichomanes \u00d7 stenosiphon, commonly known as the narrow-sheath huperzia, is a hybrid fern that exhibits characteristics of its parent species, Trichomanes and Huperzia. It is a terrestrial plant with a rhizomatous growth habit, producing erect, lanceolate fronds that are typically dimorphic, with sterile and fertile leaves. The plant's spores are borne on the undersides of the fertile fronds in sori, which are clustered in groups called sorangia. Trichomanes \u00d7 stenosiphon thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests where it contributes to the understory vegetation. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on hybridization and fern morphology."
