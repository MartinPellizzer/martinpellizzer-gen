    "intro": "Tragacantha hypoglottis, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that produces a sticky resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers and has a deep root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. The resin, known as tragacanth, is harvested from the bark and has various industrial and medicinal applications."
