    "intro": "Tillandsia huarazensis, commonly known as the Huaraz air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the Andean highlands of Peru. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is adapted to grow on rocks or trees without soil. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of white or pale purple. Due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Tillandsia genus."
