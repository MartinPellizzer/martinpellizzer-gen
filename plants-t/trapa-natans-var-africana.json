    "intro": "Trapa natans var. africana, commonly known as the African water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Africa. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are broadly ovate and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom above the water surface, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that contain edible seeds. Its root system helps stabilize sediment and improve water quality in its environment. Trapa natans var. africana is often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in various regions."
