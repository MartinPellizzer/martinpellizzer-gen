    "intro": "Triticum distichum, commonly known as slender wheat, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two-rowed spikelets, which contain the characteristic wheat grains. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. Botanically, it is closely related to other wheat species and has been studied for its genetic diversity and potential agricultural uses."
