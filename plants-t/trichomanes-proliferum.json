    "intro": "Trichomanes proliferum, commonly known as the creeping moonwort, is a small, fern-like plant that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in the understory of tropical forests. Trichomanes proliferum is notable for its unique reproductive structures, which include small, spore-producing capsules. Its botanical features make it an important component of epiphytic and lithophytic ecosystems."
