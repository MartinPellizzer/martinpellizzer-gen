    "intro": "Triumfetta pleiacantha, commonly known as the velvetleaf or African velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming during the warm seasons. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Triumfetta pleiacantha is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in some areas."
