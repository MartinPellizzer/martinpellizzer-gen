    "intro": "Taxus orientalis, commonly known as the Japanese yew, is a deciduous coniferous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals but serve as a food source for certain bird species. Its bark is thick and scaly, and it has a slow growth rate, making it long-lived. Taxus orientalis is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine."
