    "intro": "Thieleodoxa sorbilis, commonly known as the white star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that are predominantly white with a subtle pink or purple hue. The plant features a slender, erect stem with several fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a unique ornamental value to its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
