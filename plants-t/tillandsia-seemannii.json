    "intro": "Tillandsia seemannii, commonly known as the silver vernal, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup to collect water. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage is covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia seemannii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
