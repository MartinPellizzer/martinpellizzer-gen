    "intro": "Thurberia, commonly known as the golden cupplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in late summer, which are arranged in cup-like clusters. These flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Thurberia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks."
