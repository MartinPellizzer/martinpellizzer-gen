    "intro": "Typha maresii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cattail, is a wetland plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its cylindrical, brownish flower head and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize large areas quickly. Typha maresii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms and stabilizing shorelines."
