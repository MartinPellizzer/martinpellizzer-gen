    "intro": "Tillandsia mauryana, commonly known as the Mauryana air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Tillandsia mauryana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
