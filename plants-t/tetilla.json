    "intro": "Tetilla, commonly known as the \"sea holly,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to the Mediterranean region and coastal areas of southern Europe. The plants are characterized by their striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. Tetilla species typically grow in sandy or rocky soils and are often found in coastal environments. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique appearance."
