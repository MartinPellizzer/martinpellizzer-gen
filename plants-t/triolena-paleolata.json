    "intro": "Triolena paleolata, commonly known as the pale old man, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. The plant is notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
