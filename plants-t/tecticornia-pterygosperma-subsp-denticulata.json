    "intro": "Tecticornia pterygosperma subsp. denticulata, commonly known as the serrated tecticornia, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months, typically from autumn to spring. It is well adapted to saline and nutrient-poor soils, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Its subspecies distinction is based on the presence of serrated leaf margins, distinguishing it from other related species."
