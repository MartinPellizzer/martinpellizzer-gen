It belongs to the family Theaceae, which includes camellias and other ornamental shrubs. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often serrated along the edges. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing before the leaves in early spring. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild."
