    "intro": "Thalictrum simplex var. glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular meadow rue, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and prefers partial to full shade. Its stems are often hairy, and the leaves are arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. The variety 'glandulosum' is distinguished by its glandular hairs, which give it a slightly sticky texture."
