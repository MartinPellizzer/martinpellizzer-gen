    "intro": "Tisonia capuronii, commonly known as the Capuron's tisonia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories, and prefers well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a glossy surface, and it produces small, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tisonia capuronii is considered a species of conservation concern."
