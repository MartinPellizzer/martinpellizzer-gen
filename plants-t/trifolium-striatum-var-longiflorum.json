    "intro": "Trifolium striatum var. longiflorum, commonly known as the long-flowered narrow-leaf clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a narrow, linear shape. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grassy areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
