    "intro": "Tofieldia flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette at the base. Its flowering stems bear small, three-lobed flowers arranged in a spike, which are usually greenish-white in color. Tofieldia flexuosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
