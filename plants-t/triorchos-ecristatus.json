    "intro": "Triorchos ecristatus, commonly known as the spiny leaf orchid, is a unique orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky leaves and small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. Its root system is adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for survival. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
