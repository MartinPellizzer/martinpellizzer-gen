It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. It produces a tall stem with a single flower at the top, which blooms in the evening. Tium eremiticum is a perennial species that thrives in full sun and well-drained soils."
