    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. alpestris, commonly known as alpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, fragrant, gray-green leaves that are densely packed along its creeping stems. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its aromatic properties and hardiness, it is often used in herbal medicine and as a decorative plant in rock gardens."
