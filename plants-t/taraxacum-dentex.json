    "intro": "Taraxacum dentex, commonly known as the serrated dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single flower head composed of numerous yellow ray florets. Its flowers develop into a distinctive spherical seed head, known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Taraxacum dentex is typically found in temperate regions and is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings."
