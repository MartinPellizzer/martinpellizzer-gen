    "intro": "Typha angustifolia var. brownii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cattail, is a variant of the common cattail species found in wetland environments. It is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves and dense, cylindrical flower heads that produce a distinctive brownish color when mature. This plant thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, contributing to the ecological structure of wetland habitats. The plant plays a vital role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
