    "intro": "Thrinax fragilis, commonly known as the brittle palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to the Caribbean and is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark blue, fleshy fruits. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. Due to its fragility and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
