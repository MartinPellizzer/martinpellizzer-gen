    "intro": "Triticum sativum var. siculum, commonly known as Sicilian wheat, is a variant of common wheat native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its shorter stature and smaller grains compared to standard wheat varieties. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters and has a compact, bushy growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces spikelets that bear the grain heads. This variety is valued for its adaptability to dry climates and its use in traditional baking and local food systems."
