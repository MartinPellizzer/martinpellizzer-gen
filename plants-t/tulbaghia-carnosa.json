    "intro": "Tulbaghia carnosa, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a fleshy, bulbous stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it blooms during the summer months. Tulbaghia carnosa is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
