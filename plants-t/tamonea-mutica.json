    "intro": "Tamonea mutica, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It possesses small, bladder-like structures called bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow water and has slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy structures. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots. Tamonea mutica is an example of a plant that has adapted to nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
