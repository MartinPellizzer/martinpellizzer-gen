    "intro": "Toulicia, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters throughout the growing season. The plant belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is known for its vigorous growth and ability to climb or trail along structures. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and can become quite long. Toulicia is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees."
