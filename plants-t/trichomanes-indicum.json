    "intro": "Trichomanes indicum, commonly known as the Indian maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green to brownish in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes indicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
