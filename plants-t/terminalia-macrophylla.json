    "intro": "Terminalia macrophylla, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, smooth, pale grey bark and broad, elliptical leaves that are often shed during the dry season. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, elongated pods containing flat, hard seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local crafts and furniture-making. The plant also has traditional medicinal uses in various African cultures."
