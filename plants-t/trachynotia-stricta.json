    "intro": "Trachynotia stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf false flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, clustered fruits that are dispersed by wind. Trachynotia stricta is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
