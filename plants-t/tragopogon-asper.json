    "intro": "Tragopogon asper, commonly known as the rough thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf structures. The plant features rough, spiny leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a hairy texture that aids in water retention. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in spring, producing small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind. Tragopogon asper is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows and roadsides."
