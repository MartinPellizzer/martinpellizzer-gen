    "intro": "Taeniatherum asperum, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its coarse, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites. Its flowering inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are usually pale green to brown in color. Taeniatherum asperum is valued for its erosion control capabilities and as a forage crop for livestock."
