    "intro": "Tiricta daucoides, commonly known as the common hogweed, is a biennial or perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a tall, hollow stem that is often covered with fine hairs and can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant has large, umbrella-like compound leaves that are deeply lobed and may have a distinctive purple or reddish tinge on the underside. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Tiricta daucoides is known for its phototoxic sap, which can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight."
