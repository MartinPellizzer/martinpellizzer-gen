    "intro": "Triglochin densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered glassworts, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often coated with a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in saline and sandy soils. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the summer months. It is adapted to salt spray and tidal inundation, making it a hardy species found in estuarine and marshy environments. Triglochin densiflora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize coastal soils and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
