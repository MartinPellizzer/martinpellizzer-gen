    "intro": "Tritonia crocata var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces striking purple or reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a slender, branching stem with small, scale-like leaves. It is often found in sandy or disturbed soils, typically growing on the roots of other plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can be both a rare and challenging species to cultivate."
