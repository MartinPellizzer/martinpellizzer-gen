    "intro": "Taraxacum sylvaticum, commonly known as the woodland dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a hollow, winged achene. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in woodland edges and meadows. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The species is noted for its medicinal properties, with parts of the plant used in traditional herbal remedies."
