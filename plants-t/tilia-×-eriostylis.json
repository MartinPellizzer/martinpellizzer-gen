It is characterized by its elongated, serrated leaves that are typically narrower than those of its parent species. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds. This species is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
