    "intro": "Tacinga saxatilis subsp. occibahiensis, commonly known as the Occidental saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer. It is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xerophytic environments and rock gardens."
