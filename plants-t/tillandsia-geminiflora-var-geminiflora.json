    "intro": "Tillandsia geminiflora var. geminiflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, adapting it to its arid environment. It produces striking clusters of white or pink flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
