    "intro": "Tithymalus megalatlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic tithymalus, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale blue. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal winds. It is typically found in rocky outcrops and dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing the shoreline. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation assessments."
