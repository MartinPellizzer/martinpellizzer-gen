    "intro": "Taraxacum zevenbergenii, commonly known as the Zevenbergen dandelion, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves. The plant produces a slender, hollow stem that bears a single, bright yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. After flowering, it develops a capsule that releases seeds with feathery parachutes for wind dispersal. This species is notable for its ecological role in supporting local insect populations and its adaptation to the unique environmental conditions of its native habitat."
