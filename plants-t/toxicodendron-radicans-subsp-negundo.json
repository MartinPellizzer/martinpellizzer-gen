    "intro": "Toxicodendron radicans subsp. negundo, commonly known as the sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with 11 to 31 leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges, open woods, and disturbed areas. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant contain urushiol, a skin irritant that can cause allergic reactions in many people."
