It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hairy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed with a white, pappus that aids in its propagation. It thrives in temperate regions and is often found in meadows, gardens, and disturbed soils. Taraxacum belorussicum is notable for its resilience and ability to adapt to various environmental conditions."
