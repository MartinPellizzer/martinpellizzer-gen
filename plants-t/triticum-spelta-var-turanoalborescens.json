    "intro": "Triticum spelta var. turanoalborescens, commonly known as the white wheat, is a lesser-known variant of spelt wheat characterized by its pale, almost white grain. This variety is native to the Carpathian Basin and is known for its unique genetic makeup and historical significance in traditional agriculture. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, with glume-like bracts that enclose the florets. Its grains are smaller and more oval than those of common wheat, contributing to its distinct appearance and culinary uses. The botanical features of this variety make it a subject of interest for researchers studying ancient grains and their potential in modern agriculture."
