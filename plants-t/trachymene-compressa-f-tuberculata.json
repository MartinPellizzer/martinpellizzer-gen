    "intro": "Trachymene compressa f. tuberculata, commonly known as the tuberculate trachymene, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The tuberculate form refers to the distinctive warty bumps on its stems and leaves, which give it its specific epithet."
