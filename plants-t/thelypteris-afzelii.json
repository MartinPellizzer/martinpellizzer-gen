    "intro": "Thelypteris afzelii, commonly known as the broadleaf maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive bifurcated shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a layer of brown, hairy tissue, which helps in water retention. The fronds are usually biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year of growth."
