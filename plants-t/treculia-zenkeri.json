    "intro": "Treculia zenkeri, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a large evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by round, hard, woody fruits. The fruit contains a single large seed, which is used to produce shea butter, an important economic resource in many African communities. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in dense forests and secondary growth areas."
