    "intro": "Tillandsia walteri, commonly known as the Walter's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments where it attaches itself to trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with violet or purple flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
