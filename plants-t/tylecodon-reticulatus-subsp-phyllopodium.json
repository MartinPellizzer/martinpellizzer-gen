    "intro": "Tylecodon reticulatus subsp. phyllopodium, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for xeriscaping."
