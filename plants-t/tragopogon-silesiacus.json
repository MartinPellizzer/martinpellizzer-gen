    "intro": "Tragopogon silesiacus, commonly known as the Silesian goat's beard, is a perennial herb native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its upright stem and basal rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces a tall flowering stem topped with a single, showy yellow flower that resembles a dandelion. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer. Tragopogon silesiacus is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
