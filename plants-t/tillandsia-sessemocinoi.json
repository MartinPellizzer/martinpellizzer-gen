    "intro": "Tillandsia sessemocinoi, commonly known as the Serrate air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green with a slight blue or purple tint. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in the spring. Tillandsia sessemocinoi is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires high air circulation and moderate watering."
