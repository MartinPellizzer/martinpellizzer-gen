    "intro": "Trigonia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in tropical regions. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey. The plant has thin, branching stems covered in fine, woolly hairs, which give it its common name. It thrives in still or slow-moving water and is often found in muddy or boggy habitats. Its unique adaptation for capturing prey makes it an interesting subject for botanical study."
