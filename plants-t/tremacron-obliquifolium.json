    "intro": "Tremacron obliquifolium, commonly known as the slant-leaf tremacron, is a unique plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Tremacron obliquifolium is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
