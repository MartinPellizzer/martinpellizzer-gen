    "intro": "Thelypteris longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, ovate to lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a long petiole that gives the plant its common name. It produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
