    "intro": "Tulipa ophiophylla subsp. bestashica, commonly known as the bestashic tulip, is a rare and striking member of the Liliaceae family. This subspecies is characterized by its large, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, with a distinctive yellow center. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus, specifically in parts of Georgia and Armenia. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
