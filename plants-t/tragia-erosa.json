    "intro": "Tragia erosa, commonly known as the hairy beggar-tick, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Tragia erosa is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It is also known for its prickly fruits, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing."
