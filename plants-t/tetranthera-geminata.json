    "intro": "Tetranthera geminata, commonly known as the twin-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, often found growing on the branches of host trees such as oaks and other broadleaf species. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are usually red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Tetranthera geminata exhibits a unique growth habit, with its stems often splitting into two at the base, giving it its common name."
