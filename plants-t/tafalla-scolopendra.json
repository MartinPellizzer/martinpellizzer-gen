It is native to Central and South America, where it inhabits moist, forested environments. The creature is characterized by its elongated body, segmented exoskeleton, and numerous pairs of jointed legs. It plays a role in soil aeration and nutrient cycling within its ecosystem. Due to its predatory nature, it helps control populations of smaller invertebrates."
