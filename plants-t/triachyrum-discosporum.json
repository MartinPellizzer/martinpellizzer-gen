    "intro": "Triachyrum discosporum, commonly known as the disc-spore triachyrum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces distinctive disc-shaped spores, which are a key feature in its reproductive cycle. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
