    "intro": "Tectaria stalactica, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a unique epiphytic plant that thrives in humid tropical environments. It is characterized by its distinctive, cascading fronds that resemble hanging chains, giving it its common name. The plant's leaves are typically divided into small, finger-like segments, which help in maximizing surface area for photosynthesis. Tectaria stalactica is often found growing on trees or rocks in shaded, moist habitats. Its ability to absorb moisture from the air makes it well adapted to its ecological niche."
