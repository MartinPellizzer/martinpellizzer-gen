    "intro": "Thymus jankae var. albicaulis, commonly known as the white-stemmed thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features compact, creeping stems that are covered in fine, silver-gray hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or lavender in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves are used in culinary and medicinal applications, similar to other thyme species. This variety is well adapted to rocky and dry environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils."
