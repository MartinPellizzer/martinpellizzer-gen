    "intro": "Tragacantha uralensis, commonly known as the Caucasian tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its woody stems and grayish bark, which exude a viscous gum when damaged. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptation. The gum, known as tragacanth, has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent in food and cosmetics."
