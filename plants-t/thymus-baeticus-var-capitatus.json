    "intro": "Thymus baeticus var. capitatus, commonly known as the Iberian thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its medicinal and aromatic properties."
