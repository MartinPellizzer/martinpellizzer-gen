    "intro": "Trifolium microcephalum f. velutinum, commonly known as the velvet clover, is a botanical variant of the microcephalum subspecies of Trifolium. It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence that covers the stems and leaves, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its trifoliate leaves, composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, are a distinguishing feature of the species."
