    "intro": "Tetrorchidium rubrivenium var. integrifolium, commonly known as the red-veined tetrorchidium, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red veins that run through its broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its unique leaf structure and vivid coloration make it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and specialized horticulture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
