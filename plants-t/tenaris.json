    "intro": "Tenaris, commonly known as the African violet, is a popular ornamental plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, with stems that often root at the nodes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Tenaris is prized for its long blooming season and ability to produce vibrant flowers in a variety of colors."
