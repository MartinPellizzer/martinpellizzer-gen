    "intro": "Tium apilosum, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and stems, which help it conserve water in its harsh environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Tium apilosum is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry landscapes."
