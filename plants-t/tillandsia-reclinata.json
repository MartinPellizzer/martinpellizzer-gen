    "intro": "Tillandsia reclinata, commonly known as the hanging air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, thin leaves that form a rosette, which helps it collect moisture from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Tillandsia reclinata is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light to thrive."
