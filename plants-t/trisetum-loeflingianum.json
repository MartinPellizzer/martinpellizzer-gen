    "intro": "Trisetum loeflingianum, commonly known as the narrowleaf hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows and wetlands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Its inflorescence consists of a loose, open panicle, with small, spikelet-like flowers. Trisetum loeflingianum is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
