    "intro": "Trigonella disperma, commonly known as the desert fenugreek, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and Middle East. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Trigonella disperma is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
