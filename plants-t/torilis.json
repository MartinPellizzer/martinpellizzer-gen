It consists of about 30 species, most of which are native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. These plants are annual or biennial herbs that typically grow in disturbed soils and open habitats. They produce small, yellow or white flowers and have finely divided, fern-like leaves. The fruits are dry pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
