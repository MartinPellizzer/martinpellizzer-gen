    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. melanura, commonly known as black wheat, is a variety of wheat characterized by its dark-colored grains. This plant belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Its dark hue is due to the high concentration of melanin in the grain, which gives it a distinct appearance compared to common wheat. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and produces spikelets that contain several rows of dark grains. It is less commonly cultivated today but has historical significance in certain agricultural practices."
