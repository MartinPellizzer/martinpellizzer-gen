    "intro": "Triumfetta tomentosa var. macrocerata, commonly known as the woolly triumfetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in racemes, often appearing in the axils of the leaves. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape and covered in a thick layer of fine, white hairs. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
