    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 radoi, commonly known as the hybrid thyme, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. Thymus \u00d7 radoi is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Its essential oils contain thymol and carvacrol, which contribute to its medicinal and culinary uses."
