    "intro": "Tectaria coadunata, commonly known as the common tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into numerous small, toothed segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Tectaria coadunata plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
