    "intro": "Thymus senilis, commonly known as old man's beard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy foliage and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, making it useful in herbal medicine and aromatherapy. Thymus senilis is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
