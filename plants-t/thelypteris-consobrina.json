    "intro": "Thelypteris consobrina, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a structure that distinguishes it from other ferns. Thelypteris consobrina thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary ecological role is as a ground cover in forest ecosystems."
