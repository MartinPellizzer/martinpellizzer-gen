It features slender, branched stems that grow up to 1 meter in height, often with finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, arranged in compound racemes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
