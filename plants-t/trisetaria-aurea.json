    "intro": "Trisetaria aurea, commonly known as the golden hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features fine, thread-like leaves that are typically bright green and covered in a layer of silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Trisetaria aurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
