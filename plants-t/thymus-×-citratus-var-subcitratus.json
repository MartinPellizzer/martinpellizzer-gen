    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 citratus var. subcitratus, commonly known as lemon thyme, is a hybrid perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant leaves with a distinct lemony aroma, which is due to the presence of thymol and other volatile oils. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with compact, creeping stems and small pink or white flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and culinary use. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators."
