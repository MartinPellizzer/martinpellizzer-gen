    "intro": "Triticum peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian wheat, is a wild grass native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in rocky or arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Triticum peruvianum is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to extreme climates."
