    "intro": "Trifolium flexuosum subsp. heldreichianum, commonly known as the Heldreich's bentleaf clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are often curved or bent, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
