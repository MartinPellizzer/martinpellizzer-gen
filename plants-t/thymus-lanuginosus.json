    "intro": "Thymus lanuginosus, commonly known as woolly thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Thymus lanuginosus is also valued for its aromatic leaves, which are used in culinary and medicinal applications."
