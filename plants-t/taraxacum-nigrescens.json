    "intro": "Taraxacum nigrescens, commonly known as the blackening dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of Asia, often found in dry, rocky, or disturbed soils. Its flowers produce small, achene seeds with pappus, which are dispersed by wind. The species is notable for its darkening leaves and the gradual change in color of its flower head as it matures."
