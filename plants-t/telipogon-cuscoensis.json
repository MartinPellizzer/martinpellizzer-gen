    "intro": "Telipogon cuscoensis, commonly known as the Cusco orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Peru. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences and small, intricate flowers that display a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and its role in the biodiversity of the Andean region. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
