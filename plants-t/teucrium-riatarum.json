It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or coastal environments, showing a preference for well-drained soils. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are usually violet or blue in color, arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Teucrium riatarum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
