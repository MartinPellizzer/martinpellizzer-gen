    "intro": "Thamnosma texana, commonly known as Texas thamnosma, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States, particularly Texas. It is a small, herbaceous shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Thamnosma texana is adapted to thrive in full sun and is often found in desert or scrubland habitats."
