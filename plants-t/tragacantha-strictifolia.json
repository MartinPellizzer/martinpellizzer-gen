    "intro": "Tragacantha strictifolia, commonly known as the rigid thorned tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by distinctive, sticky resinous pods. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and can thrive in full sun. Tragacantha strictifolia is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural gum."
