    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 platyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lime or small-leaved lime, is a hybrid deciduous tree belonging to the Tiliaceae family. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that are typically narrower than those of its parent species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are followed by small, winged samaras. It is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and shade-providing capabilities. The bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is relatively fast-growing."
