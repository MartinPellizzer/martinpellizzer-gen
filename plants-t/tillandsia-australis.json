    "intro": "Tillandsia australis, commonly known as the silver vanda, is a bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, narrow leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically white or pale purple and bloom in clusters. It is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
