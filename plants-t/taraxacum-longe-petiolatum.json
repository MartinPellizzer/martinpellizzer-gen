    "intro": "Taraxacum longe-petiolatum, commonly known as the long-petioled dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its long, slender petioles that support its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seed heads, typical of the dandelion genus. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained, sunny environments. Its botanical features make it a common weed in many regions, though it also serves as a food source for various insects."
