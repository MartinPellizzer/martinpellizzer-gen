    "intro": "Tarrietia argyrodendron var. peralata, commonly known as silver-leafed tree fern, is a unique variant of the tree fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its striking silver-white undersides on the fronds, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a tall, slender trunk with a fibrous, woody base, and its fronds are long and pinnately divided. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
