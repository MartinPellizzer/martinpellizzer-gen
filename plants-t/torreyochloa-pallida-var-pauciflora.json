    "intro": "Torreyochloa pallida var. pauciflora, commonly known as the pale torreyo, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming habit and narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers in spikelets during the summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
