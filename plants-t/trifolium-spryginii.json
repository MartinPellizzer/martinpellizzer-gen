    "intro": "Trifolium spryginii, commonly known as the Sprygin's clover, is a flowering plant species native to specific regions of Eastern Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. Trifolium spryginii is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils, often found in meadows and grasslands, and plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
