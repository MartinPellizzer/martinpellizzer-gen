It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often thornless stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects."
