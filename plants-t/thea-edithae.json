    "intro": "Thea edithae, commonly known as Edith's lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has narrow, strap-like leaves that form a rosette at the base. Its blooming period occurs in the spring, and it is noted for its ornamental value in horticulture. Due to habitat loss, Thea edithae is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
