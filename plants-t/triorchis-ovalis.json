    "intro": "Triorchis ovalis, commonly known as the oval duckweed, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae. It is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that float on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant typically grows in dense mats, forming a dense green carpet on the water's surface. It lacks true stems and roots, relying instead on rhizomes for anchorage and nutrient absorption. Triorchis ovalis is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
