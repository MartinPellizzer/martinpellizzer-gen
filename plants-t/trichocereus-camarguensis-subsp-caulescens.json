    "intro": "Trichocereus camarguensis subsp. caulescens, commonly known as the Camargue torch cactus, is a species native to southern France and parts of Spain. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, green stems that often develop a reddish tinge under intense sunlight. The plant produces large, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming at night. It thrives in arid or semi-arid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
