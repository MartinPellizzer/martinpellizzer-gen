    "intro": "Thelypteris panigrahii, commonly known as the Himalayan shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its erect, compact fronds that are typically 15\u201330 cm in length, with a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories at high elevations. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its unique foliage."
