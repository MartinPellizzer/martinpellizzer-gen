    "intro": "Tetragonia echinata, commonly known as sea beet, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its roots are edible and have a slightly salty, tangy flavor, making it a traditional food source in some regions. Tetragonia echinata is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
