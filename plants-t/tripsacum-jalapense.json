It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces numerous small, white to pale purple florets that are clustered in dense panicles. It is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry, open habitats. Tripsacum jalapense has historical significance in indigenous agriculture and is related to cultivated maize species."
