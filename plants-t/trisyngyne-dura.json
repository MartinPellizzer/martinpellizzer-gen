    "intro": "Trisyngyne dura, commonly known as the hard-sheathed tristyngyne, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific microhabitats. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its unique morphological features, including its rigid, woody sheaths. The plant exhibits a sympodial growth pattern, with multiple stems arising from a single root system. Its leaves are typically small,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and have a distinct arrangement that aids in water retention. Trisyngyne dura is notable for its ecological niche and is often associated with nutrient-poor soils in tropical regions."
