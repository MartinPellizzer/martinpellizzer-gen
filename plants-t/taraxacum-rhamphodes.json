    "intro": "Taraxacum rhamphodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that produces a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a taproot system and is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. The flowers are followed by a distinctive pappus-based seed dispersal mechanism, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind."
