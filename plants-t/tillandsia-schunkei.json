    "intro": "Tillandsia schunkei, commonly known as the Schunke's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, adapting it to its often-dry habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and it blooms once in its lifetime. Tillandsia schunkei is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
