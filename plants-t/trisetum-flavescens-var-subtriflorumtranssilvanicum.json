    "intro": "Trisetum flavescens var. subtriflorumtranssilvanicum, commonly known as the Transylvanian false brome, is a grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow to brownish spikelets that are clustered at the ends of the stems. It typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows and pastures. This variety is distinguished by its slightly different floral structure compared to the typical form of Trisetum flavescens."
