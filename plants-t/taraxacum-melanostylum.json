    "intro": "Taraxacum melanostylum, commonly known as the black-stemmed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, dark green leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem that is often tinged with a dark color, giving it its common name. It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in meadows and open woodlands. The seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like structure, typical of the dandelion genus."
