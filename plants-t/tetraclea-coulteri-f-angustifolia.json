    "intro": "Tetraclea coulteri f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed Coulter's tetraclea, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of Texas. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by seed capsules that mature in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a unique addition to native plant gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for ecological and botanical study."
