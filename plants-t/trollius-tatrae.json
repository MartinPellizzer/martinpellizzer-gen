    "intro": "Trollius tatrae, commonly known as the Tatra buttercup, is a rare alpine plant native to the Tatra Mountains in Central Europe. It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in high-altitude, rocky environments. It is considered an indicator species for calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and alpine tundra. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trollius tatrae is classified as a vulnerable species."
