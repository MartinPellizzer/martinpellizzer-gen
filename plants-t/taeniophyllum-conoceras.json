    "intro": "Taeniophyllum conoceras, commonly known as the velvet leaf orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and velvety, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in home greenhouses or terrariums."
