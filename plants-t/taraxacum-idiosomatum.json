    "intro": "Taraxacum idiosomatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family. It is characterized by its hairy, elongated stems and basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, tall, yellow composite flower head that develops into a spherical seed ball with parachute-like seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. This species is notable for its ability to spread readily through wind-dispersed seeds."
