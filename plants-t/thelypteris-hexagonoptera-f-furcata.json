    "intro": "Thelypteris hexagonoptera f. furcata, commonly known as the forked shield fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds. The plant features bipinnate leaves with a shield-shaped outline, giving it a unique appearance. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps in reducing water loss. The sori, which are clusters of sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests."
