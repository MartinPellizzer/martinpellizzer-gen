    "intro": "Tillandsia monticola, commonly known as the mountain tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense structure, which helps it collect and retain moisture from the humid air. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale pink. Tillandsia monticola is well adapted to its high-altitude environment, with specialized structures that allow it to thrive in low-light, moist conditions."
