    "intro": "Taraxacum heleonastes, commonly known as the Greek dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, where it thrives in meadows and open woodlands. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a spherical seed head. It produces wind-dispersed seeds, which are enclosed in a pappus of fine hairs. The species is often used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
