    "intro": "Taraxacum acidotum, commonly known as the acid dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces a milky latex when the leaves are damaged, which is a common feature among the genus Taraxacum. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other sunny, well-drained areas."
