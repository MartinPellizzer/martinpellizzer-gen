    "intro": "Tephroseris elodes, commonly known as the water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that often float on the water surface, with small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are inconspicuous, consisting of tiny, greenish-white blooms that appear in late spring to early summer. Tephroseris elodes plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
