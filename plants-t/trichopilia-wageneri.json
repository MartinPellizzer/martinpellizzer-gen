It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance. The plant features slender, erect stems covered in soft, white hairs, giving it a woolly texture. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically arranged in spikelets, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Trichopilia wageneri is often found in wetlands and forest understories, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
