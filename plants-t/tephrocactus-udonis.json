    "intro": "Tephrocactus udonis, commonly known as the Udonis cactus, is a species native to Mexico, specifically the state of Oaxaca. It is a small, globular cactus with a compact, rounded shape and a ribbed structure. The plant features a dense covering of white, woolly hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in the axils of the stems during the warmer months. Tephrocactus udonis is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found growing in limestone soils."
