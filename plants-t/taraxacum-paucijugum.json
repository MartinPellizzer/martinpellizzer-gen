    "intro": "Taraxacum paucijugum, commonly known as the few-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which develop into a spherical seed head with parachute-like seeds. It is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
