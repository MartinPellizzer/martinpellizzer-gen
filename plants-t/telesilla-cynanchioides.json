It is characterized by its silver-gray, hairy leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including livestock. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Telesilla cynanchioides is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae), which includes several species with similar defensive traits."
