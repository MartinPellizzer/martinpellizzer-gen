    "intro": "Tolmachevia integrifolia subsp. leedyi, commonly known as the Leedy's desert lily, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features erect, branching stems covered in narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
