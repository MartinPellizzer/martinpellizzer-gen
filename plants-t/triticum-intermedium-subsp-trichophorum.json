    "intro": "Triticum intermedium subsp. trichophorum, commonly known as intermediate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the North America and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves, with spikelets that produce small, awned grains. This plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both temperate and semi-arid climates. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it a valuable plant for ecological restoration. Additionally, it is cultivated for forage and has potential as a biofuel crop due to its high biomass yield."
