    "intro": "Thalictrum viscosum, commonly known as sticky meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, usually white or pale yellow flowers in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Thalictrum viscosum is noted for its sticky secretions on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name."
