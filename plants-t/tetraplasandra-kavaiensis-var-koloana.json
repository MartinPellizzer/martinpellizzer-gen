It typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, often arranged alternately along the stems. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, producing a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural propagation in its native habitat."
