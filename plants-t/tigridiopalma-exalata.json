    "intro": "Tigridiopalma exalata, commonly known as the sky palm, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, palm-like fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a unique growth habit, often growing in a rosette formation with its leaves radiating outward. Its foliage is dark green and glossy, with a slightly waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its humid, high-altitude habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tigridiopalma exalata is considered a conservation concern."
