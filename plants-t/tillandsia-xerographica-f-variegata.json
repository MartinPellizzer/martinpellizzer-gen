    "intro": "Tillandsia xerographica f. variegata, commonly known as the variegated air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is widely cultivated as a decorative plant."
