    "intro": "Tomophyllum callophyllum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of New Guinea. It is characterized by its unique, translucent, waxy leaves that appear to shimmer in the light, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators such as moths. Its growth is slow and requires a humid, shaded environment to thrive. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Tomophyllum callophyllum is considered a critically endangered species."
