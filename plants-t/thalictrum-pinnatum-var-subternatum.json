    "intro": "Thalictrum pinnatum var. subternatum, commonly known as the fernleaf meadow rue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
