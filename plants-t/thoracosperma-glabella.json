    "intro": "Thoracosperma glabella, commonly known as the smooth-barked mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive smooth, pale bark and its ability to thrive in brackish water environments. The plant has aerial roots that help it anchor in soft, muddy soils and facilitate gas exchange. Its leaves are typically small, ovate, and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Thoracosperma glabella plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
