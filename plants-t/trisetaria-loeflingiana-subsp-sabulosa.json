    "intro": "Trisetaria loeflingiana subsp. sabulosa, commonly known as the sand dune grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and fine, hairy leaves adapted to sandy soils. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flower spikes that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy environments and is often found in dune ecosystems. Its ability to stabilize sand dunes makes it an important pioneer species in coastal restoration efforts."
