    "intro": "Tillandsia lindeniana, commonly known as the Lindenberg air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically long and strap-like, forming a rosette that collects moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue in color. Tillandsia lindeniana is well adapted to humid environments and requires bright, indirect light to thrive."
