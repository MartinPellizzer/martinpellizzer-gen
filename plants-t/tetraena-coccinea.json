    "intro": "Tetraena coccinea, commonly known as the scarlet tetraena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Tetraena coccinea is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
