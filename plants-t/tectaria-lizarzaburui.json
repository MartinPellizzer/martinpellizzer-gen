    "intro": "Tectaria lizarzaburui, commonly known as the Lizarzaburu tectaria, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a leathery texture and intricate venation patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in cloud forests or along riverbanks. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tectaria lizarzaburui is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
