    "intro": "Tessmannia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved tessmannia, is a shrub native to the eastern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom from September to November. Tessmannia parvifolia is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. It is a valuable plant for ecological studies due to its unique adaptations to arid environments."
