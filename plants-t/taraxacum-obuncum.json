    "intro": "Taraxacum obuncum, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed dispersal mechanism. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. Its flowers bloom in spring and early summer, and it is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Taraxacum obuncum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
