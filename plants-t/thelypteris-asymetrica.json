    "intro": "Thelypteris asymetrica, commonly known as the asymmetrical shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, asymmetrical fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, oval-shaped pinnae."
