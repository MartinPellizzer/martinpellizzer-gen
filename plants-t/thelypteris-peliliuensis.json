    "intro": "Thelypteris peliliuensis, commonly known as the Lepidoptera fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
