    "intro": "Tillandsia recurvata f. major, commonly known as the giant air plant, is a unique bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. This epiphytic plant lacks traditional roots and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its broad, strap-like leaves. Its foliage is typically green to blue-green, with some varieties displaying a striking purple hue. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting or soaking to maintain humidity. Due to its distinctive appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
