    "intro": "Trichocline humilis, commonly known as the low trichocline, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It is adapted to survive in poor soil conditions and can withstand periods of drought. Trichocline humilis is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is an important component of local plant communities."
