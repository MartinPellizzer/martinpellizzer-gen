    "intro": "Tillandsia itaubensis, commonly known as the Ita\u00faba air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers, which attract pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is popular among collectors and indoor gardeners."
