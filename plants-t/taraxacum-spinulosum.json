    "intro": "Taraxacum spinulosum, commonly known as the spiny dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spiny, hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces a single, hollow, leaf-like stem that terminates in a flower head composed of yellow ray florets. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and meadows. The spiny leaves and unique morphology make it easily distinguishable from other dandelion species."
