    "intro": "Tithymalus shetoensis, commonly known as the Shetland thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Shetland Islands of Scotland. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often used in culinary applications due to their mild thyme-like scent. Tithymalus shetoensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal habitats. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and supporting biodiversity in its native range."
