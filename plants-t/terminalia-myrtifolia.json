It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmate leaves. The tree produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in winter, followed by woody, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and reforestation projects."
