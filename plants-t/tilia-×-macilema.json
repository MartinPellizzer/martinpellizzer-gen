    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 macilema, commonly known as the hybrid linden, is a deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Tilia cordata and Tilia europaea. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and urban landscapes."
