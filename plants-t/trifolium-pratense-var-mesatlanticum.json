    "intro": "Trifolium pratense var. mesatlanticum, commonly known as the mesoatlantic red clover, is a variant of the common red clover species. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, typically with three heart-shaped leaflets, and small pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. This plant is native to the eastern United States and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in forage and as a cover crop due to its hardy nature and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The variant is distinguished by its geographic distribution and slight morphological differences from the typical red clover."
