    "intro": "Thelypteris anopteros, commonly known as the narrow-leaved shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are typically narrow and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile leaves, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori. Thelypteris anopteros is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in shaded gardens."
