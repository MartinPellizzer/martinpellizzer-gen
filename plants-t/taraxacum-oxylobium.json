    "intro": "Taraxacum oxylobium, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves with lobed margins, and it produces a hollow, slender stem that supports its yellow flowering head. Its flowers are typically followed by a parachute-like seed dispersal mechanism, typical of the genus Taraxacum. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows."
