It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often used in traditional herbal medicine. Tithymalus repens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
