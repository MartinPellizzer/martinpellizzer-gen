    "intro": "Trichophorum filipes, commonly known as the slender hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and slender, hair-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Trichophorum filipes thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
