    "intro": "Trophis chorizantha, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a sprawling, shrub-like growth habit. Its leaves are hairy and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
