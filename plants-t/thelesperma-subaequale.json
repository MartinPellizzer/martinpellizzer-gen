It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow to orange flowers. The plant has compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its fruit is a dry, three-lobed pod that contains several seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and the ability to store water in its stems."
