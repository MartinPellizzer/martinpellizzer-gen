It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients effectively.
