    "intro": "Thelypteris yunguiensis, commonly known as the Yungui fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of China. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil, while its spores are dispersed by wind. Thelypteris yunguiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
