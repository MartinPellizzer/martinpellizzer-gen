It is a perennial herb with fronds that are typically narrow and elongated, featuring a distinctive, leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or woodland areas. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. The narrowleaf rock fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest understories."
