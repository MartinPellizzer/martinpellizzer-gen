It is characterized by its hairy, heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Tragia calvescens is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered an invasive species in some regions. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types contribute to its ecological impact."
