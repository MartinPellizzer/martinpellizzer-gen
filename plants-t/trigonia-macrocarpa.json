    "intro": "Trigonia macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, which float on the surface of still or slow-moving waters. The plant's flowers are typically white or pink, with a distinctive, showy appearance that attracts pollinators such as beetles. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in the mud and absorbing nutrients from the water. Trigonia macrocarpa plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration."
