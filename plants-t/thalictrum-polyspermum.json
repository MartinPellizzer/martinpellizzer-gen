    "intro": "Thalictrum polyspermum, commonly known as the many-seeded meadow-rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and meadows. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces numerous small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind. Thalictrum polyspermum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits to native pollinators."
