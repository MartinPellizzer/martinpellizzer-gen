    "intro": "Tetracera trigyna, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its valuable timber, Tetracera trigyna is also considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range."
