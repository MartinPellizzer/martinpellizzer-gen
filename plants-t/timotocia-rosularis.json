    "intro": "Timotocia rosularis, commonly known as the Rosular Rose, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit, with fleshy, silver-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
