    "intro": "Tephrocactus pyrrhacanthus var. leucoluteus, commonly known as the white-flowered red barrel cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to Mexico, specifically the state of San Luis Potos\u00ed, where it grows in rocky, arid environments. The plant is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically red or purple in color. Its most distinguishing feature is its vibrant white flowers, which bloom in late spring and early summer. This variety is prized by botanists and collectors for its unique appearance and limited distribution."
