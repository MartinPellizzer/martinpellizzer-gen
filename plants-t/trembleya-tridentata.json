It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into three distinct segments, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its spores are dispersed through the wind, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The botanical features of Trembleya tridentata make it an important component of the ecosystems it inhabits."
