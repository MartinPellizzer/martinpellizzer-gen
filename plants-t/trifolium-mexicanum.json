    "intro": "Trifolium mexicanum, commonly known as Mexican clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
