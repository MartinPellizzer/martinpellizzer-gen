    "intro": "Thuja, commonly known as arborvitae, is a genus of evergreen coniferous trees and shrubs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. These plants are characterized by their flat, scale-like leaves arranged in crosses, giving them a distinctive appearance. Thuja species are often used in landscaping for their dense foliage and ability to form hedges or screens. They thrive in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making them adaptable to various garden settings. The wood of thuja is resistant to decay, which has historically made it valuable for construction and shipbuilding."
