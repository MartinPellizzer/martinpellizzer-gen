    "intro": "Tectaria confluens, commonly known as the broad-leaf tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as tropical forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
