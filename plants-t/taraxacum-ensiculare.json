    "intro": "Taraxacum ensiculare, commonly known as the swordleaf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves and a single, yellow, composite flower head. Native to Europe, it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces a hollow, spiky stem that supports its flowering head, which is followed by a crown of bracts resembling a clock. It is a perennial plant that thrives in temperate climates and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
