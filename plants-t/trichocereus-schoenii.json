    "intro": "Trichocereus schoenii, commonly known as the Amazonian torch cactus, is a species native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the night, which are typically short-lived but attract nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a unique ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. Trichocereus schoenii is also known for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of hallucinogenic compounds."
