    "intro": "Tragacantha compressus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, powdery hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its roots are known for their ability to exude a gelatinous substance, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Tragacantha compressus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments."
