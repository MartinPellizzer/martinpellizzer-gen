    "intro": "Thesium pottiae, commonly known as the golden sandbur, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by distinctive, spiny burrs that aid in seed dispersal. Thesium pottiae thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune environments. It is adapted to arid conditions and is relatively drought-tolerant."
