    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudokamtschaticum, commonly known as the Kamchatka dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow flowering head that produces a pappus for seed dispersal. Native to the mountainous regions of eastern Siberia and the Russian Far East, it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant is perennial and exhibits a taproot system, allowing it to survive in harsh climates. Its botanical features make it a notable example of the diversity within the genus Taraxacum."
