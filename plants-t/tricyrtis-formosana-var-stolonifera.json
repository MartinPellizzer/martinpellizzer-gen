    "intro": "Tricyrtis formosana var. stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous Japanese violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Japan. It features delicate, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive, spurred shape, often resembling orchids. The plant produces stolons, which are horizontal stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for woodland gardens and shaded borders."
