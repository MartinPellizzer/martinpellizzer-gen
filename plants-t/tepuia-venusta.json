    "intro": "Tepuia venusta, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, thick stem covered in dense, spiny areoles, which help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain animals. Tepuia venusta is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient and unique member of its ecosystem."
