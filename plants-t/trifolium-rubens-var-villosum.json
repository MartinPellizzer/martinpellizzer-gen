    "intro": "Trifolium rubens var. villosum, commonly known as hairy red clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites. This variety is valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage crop for livestock."
