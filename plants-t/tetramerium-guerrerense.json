    "intro": "Tetramerium guerrerense, commonly known as the Guerrerense tetramerium, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features simple, opposite leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, clustered flowers with five petals. Its botanical significance lies in its role within its native ecosystem and its potential for medicinal uses. However, it is relatively rare and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive."
