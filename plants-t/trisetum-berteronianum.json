It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Trisetum berteronianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
