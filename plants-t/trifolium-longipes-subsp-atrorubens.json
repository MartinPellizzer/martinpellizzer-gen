It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically dark red to purple in color, and its small, pea-like flowers that range from pink to pale purple. This subspecies is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
