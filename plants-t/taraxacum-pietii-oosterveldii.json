    "intro": "Taraxacum pietii-oosterveldii, commonly known as the Oosterveld's dandelion, is a rare and endemic species of the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its hairy, elongated stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to the lowland areas of the Netherlands and is often found in moist, calcareous soils. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a wavy margin and are covered in fine, white hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
