    "intro": "Taraxacum oliganthum, commonly known as the rare mountain dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that produces a single, small, yellow composite flower. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and exhibits a unique flowering pattern, blooming late in the growing season. Its flowers develop into small, elongated seeds with pappus, facilitating wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
