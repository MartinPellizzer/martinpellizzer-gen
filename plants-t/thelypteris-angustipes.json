    "intro": "Thelypteris angustipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomes are often submerged or partially buried, supporting the growth of its aquatic or semi-aquatic fronds. Thelypteris angustipes plays a role in maintaining wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
