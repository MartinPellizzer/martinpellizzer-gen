    "intro": "Trichomanes motleyi var. cognatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate and rare fern species native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that resemble those of true maidenhair ferns. The plant has a compact growth habit with rhizomes that produce both sterile and fertile fronds. Its leaves are typically broader and more robust compared to other members of the genus, and they often have a distinctive, silvery-veined appearance. This variety is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as stream banks and woodland floors."
