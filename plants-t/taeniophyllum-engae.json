    "intro": "Taeniophyllum engae, commonly known as the silver leaf fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Its rhizomes are short and thick, anchoring it to its host while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Taeniophyllum engae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in terrariums and greenhouses."
