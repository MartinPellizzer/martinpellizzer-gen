    "intro": "Terniopsis daoyinensis, commonly known as the Daoyinensis fern, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Terniopsidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that emerge from a short, creeping rhizome. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
