    "intro": "Thesium alpinum var. tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaved thesium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, arranged in dense, mat-forming structures. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many areas."
