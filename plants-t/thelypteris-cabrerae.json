    "intro": "Thelypteris cabrerae, commonly known as the Cabrera's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces spores in clusters on the undersides of its leaves, which are released during the dry season. Thelypteris cabrerae thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
