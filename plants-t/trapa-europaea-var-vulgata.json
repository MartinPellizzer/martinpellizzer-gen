    "intro": "Trapa europaea var. vulgata, commonly known as the European water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves and distinctive, spiny fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshes and ponds. Its leaves are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The species is notable for its ability to spread rapidly through seed dispersal, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive."
