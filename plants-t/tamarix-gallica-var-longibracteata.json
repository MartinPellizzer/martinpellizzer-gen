    "intro": "Tamarix gallica var. longibracteata, commonly known as the Long-bract Sea-buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces bright orange-red berries that are clustered in globose heads, which are a key feature of its botanical description. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and saline environments. The variety is distinguished by its elongated bracts, which give it its specific name."
