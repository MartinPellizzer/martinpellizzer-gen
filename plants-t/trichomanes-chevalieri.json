    "intro": "Trichomanes chevalieri, commonly known as the Chevalier's maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky surfaces or in dense forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are small and clustered, typical of the Hymenophyllaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichomanes chevalieri is considered a rare and endangered species."
