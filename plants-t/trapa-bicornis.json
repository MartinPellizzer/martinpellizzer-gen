    "intro": "Trapa bicornis, commonly known as the two-horned water chestnut, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, floating leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom above the water surface, followed by the development of spiny, triangular fruits. Its roots are adapted to anchor in muddy substrates, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Trapa bicornis is often found in wetlands, ponds, and along the edges of rivers."
