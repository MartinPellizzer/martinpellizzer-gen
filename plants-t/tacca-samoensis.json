    "intro": "Tacca samoensis, commonly known as the sacred lotus of Samoa, is a striking tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces a unique, pendulous inflorescence with spatheate flowers that resemble a human face, earning it the nickname \"flower of the devil.\" It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist, lowland forests. Due to its cultural significance and rarity, Tacca samoensis is considered a valuable and protected species in its native range."
