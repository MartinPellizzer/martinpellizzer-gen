    "intro": "Trollius montanus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features a short, stout stem with several yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Trollius montanus is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine environment."
