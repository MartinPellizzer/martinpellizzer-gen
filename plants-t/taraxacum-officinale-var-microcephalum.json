    "intro": "Taraxacum officinale var. microcephalum, commonly known as the microcephalous dandelion, is a variant of the common dandelion characterized by its smaller, more compact flower heads. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and slightly lobed. Its flowers are yellow and produce a fluffy white seed head, which is dispersed by the wind. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in herbal remedies."
