    "intro": "Trichomanes acranthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, glossy, dark green fronds that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is sometimes cultivated in controlled greenhouse settings."
