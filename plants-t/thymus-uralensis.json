    "intro": "Thymus uralensis, commonly known as Siberian thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Siberia. It features small, needle-like leaves and produces tiny, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant foliage, which contains essential oils responsible for its strong, minty scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental or for its medicinal properties."
