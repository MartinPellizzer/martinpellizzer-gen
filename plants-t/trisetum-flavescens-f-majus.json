    "intro": "Trisetum flavescens f. majus, commonly known as the giant yellow hairgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, yellowish-green foliage that turns golden in autumn. This variant is notable for its larger size compared to the typical form of Trisetum flavescens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically wind-pollinated."
