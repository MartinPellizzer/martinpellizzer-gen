    "intro": "Tradescantia glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky leaf spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, glandular-stippled leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its unique leaf structure and vibrant flowers make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable."
