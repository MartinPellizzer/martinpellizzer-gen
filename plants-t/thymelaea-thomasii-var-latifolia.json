    "intro": "Thymelaea thomasii var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved thymelaea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhamnaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Native to southern Africa, this plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid regions. The leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is a low-growing shrub that produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds."
