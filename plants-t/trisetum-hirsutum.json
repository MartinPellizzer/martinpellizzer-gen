    "intro": "Trisetum hirsutum, commonly known as hairy wood oat, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Trisetum hirsutum is often found in mixed vegetation and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland areas."
