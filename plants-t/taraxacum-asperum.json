    "intro": "Taraxacum asperum, commonly known as the rough dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of rough, hairy, and often reddish leaves. The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, elongated flower head composed of yellow ray florets. Its flowers develop into a distinctive, spiky seed head with parachute-like seeds for wind dispersal. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
