    "intro": "Triaspis sapinii, commonly known as the mountain hellebore, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a rosette of thick, waxy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white down. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by poisonous, reddish berries. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often found in remote, undisturbed habitats."
