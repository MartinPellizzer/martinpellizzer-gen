    "intro": "Torminaria, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, often fragrant flowers that come in shades of white, pink, and purple. These plants are typically found in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Torminaria species are perennial herbs with rhizomatous growth, and they produce small, capsule-like fruits that disperse their seeds. The genus includes several species, such as Torminaria palustris, which is native to parts of Europe and Asia."
