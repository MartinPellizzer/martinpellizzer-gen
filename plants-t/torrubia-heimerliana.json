    "intro": "Torrubia heimerliana, commonly known as the Heimerli's torrubia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing, shrub-like structure. The plant typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Torrubia heimerliana is considered a vulnerable species."
