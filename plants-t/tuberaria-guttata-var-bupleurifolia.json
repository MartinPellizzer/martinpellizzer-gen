    "intro": "Tuberaria guttata var. bupleurifolia, commonly known as the spotted bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, erect stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in spring. Its tuberous roots are characteristic of the genus Tuberaria, contributing to its ability to survive in dry conditions. The varietal name *bupleurifolia* refers to its leaf structure resembling that of the genus Bupleurum."
