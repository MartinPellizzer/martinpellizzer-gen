    "intro": "Trifolium talyschense, commonly known as the Talyschense clover, is a flowering plant species native to Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and agricultural settings."
