    "intro": "Tragacantha infesta, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its greyish bark, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Tragacantha infesta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitats."
