It is native to China and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, orange-colored fruits that resemble small lanterns. The plant produces yellow flowers and has a climbing habit, often supported by tendrils. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are cylindrical and also hairy.
