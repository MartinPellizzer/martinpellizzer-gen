It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady habitats at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows and forested areas. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
