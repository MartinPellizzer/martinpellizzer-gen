    "intro": "Toxicodendron coriaria, commonly known as the poison ivy vine, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is a climbing shrub that produces small, yellowish flowers and red, fleshy fruits that contain toxic compounds. The plant contains urushiol, a potent allergen that causes skin irritation and itching in many people. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slight lobed appearance. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid contact with the skin."
