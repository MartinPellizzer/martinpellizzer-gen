    "intro": "Trifolium stellatum var. stellatum, commonly known as star clover, is a perennial legume native to North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically white or pale green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow or white flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom in the spring and early summer. Star clover thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in pastures and as a forage crop due to its nutritional value. It also has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
