    "intro": "Trifolium thompsonii, commonly known as Thompson's clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval to heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, typically clustered in spherical heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
