    "intro": "Taraxacum angustifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, elongated leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a sphere of white pappus-tipped seeds. Native to Europe, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant is known for its ability to produce a large number of lightweight seeds that are easily dispersed by wind. It is often considered a weed but has ecological and potential medicinal value."
