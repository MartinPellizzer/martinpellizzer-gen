    "intro": "Tephrosia karkarensis, commonly known as Karkar Hills tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and often nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for biodiversity studies in its native habitat."
