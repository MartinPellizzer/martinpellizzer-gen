    "intro": "Tapeinotes, commonly known as the smoothleaf sedge, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and reeds. It is a perennial herb characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves, which are typically smooth and narrow. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, often in clusters at the ends of the stems. Tapeinotes is often found in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
