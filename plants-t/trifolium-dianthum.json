    "intro": "Trifolium dianthum, commonly known as the purple clover, is a flowering plant species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, purple or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or pea family, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Trifolium dianthum is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its role in sustainable agriculture."
