    "intro": "Trigonella cephalotes, commonly known as the desert cowpea, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces pods that contain small, edible seeds, which are rich in protein and nutrients. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Trigonella cephalotes is also valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded areas."
