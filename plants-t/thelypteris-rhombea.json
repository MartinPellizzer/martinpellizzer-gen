    "intro": "Thelypteris rhombea, commonly known as the round-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, compact fronds that form a rosette-like structure, often growing in wet, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a distinctive, rounded shape, which contributes to its ornamental appeal. Thelypteris rhombea is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
