    "intro": "Taraxacum phalarocephalum, commonly known as the narrow-headed dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated stem that bears a flowering head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of smaller florets, typical of the dandelion genus. It produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus, which aids in its propagation. This species is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils."
