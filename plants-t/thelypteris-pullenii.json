    "intro": "Thelypteris pullenii, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length, making it one of the largest ferns in the world. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the water. Thelypteris pullenii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
