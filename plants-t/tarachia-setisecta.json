    "intro": "Tarachia setisecta, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, fuzzy leaves that are deeply lobed and segmented. Its flowers are yellow and appear in early spring, followed by distinctive bristled seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Tarachia setisecta is adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep roots and a succulent stem that helps store water."
