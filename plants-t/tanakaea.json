    "intro": "Tanakaea, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Aizoaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, often spiny leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, where they thrive in saline and well-drained conditions. Tanakaea species are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and hardy nature. Their unique appearance makes them popular in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
