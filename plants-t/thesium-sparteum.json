    "intro": "Thesium sparteum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Thesium sparteum is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to harsh, dry environments."
