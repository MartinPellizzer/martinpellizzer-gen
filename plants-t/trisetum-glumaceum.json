    "intro": "Trisetum glumaceum, commonly known as the slender basket grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear diminutive, glume-bearing flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Trisetum glumaceum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks. Its ecological value includes providing habitat and forage for various insect and small animal species."
