    "intro": "Trichomanes philippianum, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in humid forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes philippianum is native to Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
