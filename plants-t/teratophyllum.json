It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its striking, spiny stems that resemble a backbone. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Teratophyllum is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well adapted to arid environments."
