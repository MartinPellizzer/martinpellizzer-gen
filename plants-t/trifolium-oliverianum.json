    "intro": "Trifolium oliverianum, commonly known as Oliver's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in early spring. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in well-drained soils and sunny to partially shaded environments. Oliver's clover is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
