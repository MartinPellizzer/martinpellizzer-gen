    "intro": "Thelypteris delasotae, commonly known as the Delasota holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive, almost holly-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds. Thelypteris delasotae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
