    "intro": "Tradescantia glabra, commonly known as spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are usually smooth and glabrous. The plant produces clusters of small, three-petaled flowers in shades of white, blue, or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Tradescantia glabra is also known for its ability to spread through runners, forming dense ground cover."
