    "intro": "Trifolium oreganum f. brachypus, commonly known as the short-stemmed clover, is a botanical variant of the common white clover. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stems compared to the typical form. The leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields or along roadsides. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
