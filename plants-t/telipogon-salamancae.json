    "intro": "Telipogon salamancae, commonly known as the Salamanca orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its root system is specialized for nutrient absorption in poor soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for survival. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
