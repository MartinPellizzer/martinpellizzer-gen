    "intro": "Thymus rigidulus, commonly known as rigid thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically forms dense mats of aromatic, woody stems covered with small, gray-green leaves. The plant produces tiny, pink to purple flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications."
