    "intro": "Taraxacum turfosum, commonly known as the meadow dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flowering head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed with a white pappus, aiding in its spread across open habitats. It thrives in moist, temperate environments such as meadows and pastures. Taraxacum turfosum is often found in nutrient-rich soils and is relatively hardy, tolerating a range of environmental conditions."
