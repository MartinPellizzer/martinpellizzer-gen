    "intro": "Tulipa bifloriformis, commonly known as the two-flowered tulip, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring two distinct flower heads on a single stem, which set it apart from other tulip species. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped blooms in shades of red, yellow, and orange, often with a contrasting throat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, preferring cooler climates. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in the wild."
