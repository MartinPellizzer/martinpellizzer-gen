    "intro": "Torularia humilis subsp. arctica, commonly known as the Arctic torula, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It plays a minor but important role in the ecological dynamics of its harsh, polar ecosystems."
