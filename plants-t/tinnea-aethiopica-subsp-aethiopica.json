    "intro": "Tinnea aethiopica subsp. aethiopica, commonly known as the Ethiopian tinnea, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in compact inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited rainfall."
