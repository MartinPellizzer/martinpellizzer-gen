    "intro": "Taraxacum laticordatum, commonly known as the broad-heart dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, tall stem topped with a bright yellow composite flower head that blooms in spring. After flowering, it develops a distinctive spherical seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds. It is commonly found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and is known for its medicinal properties."
