    "intro": "Turnera ulmifolia var. elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf turnera, is a perennial shrub native to Central America and parts of South America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable choice for gardens in warmer climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
