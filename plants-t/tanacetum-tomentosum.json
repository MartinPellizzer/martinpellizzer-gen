    "intro": "Tanacetum tomentosum, commonly known as fuzzy tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, gray-green foliage covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white composite flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Tanacetum tomentosum is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties."
