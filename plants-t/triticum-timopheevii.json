    "intro": "Triticum timopheevii, commonly known as wild wheat, is a wild species of wheat native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, pale blue or greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in tough, dry glumes, and the plant is often found growing in dry, sandy soils. Triticum timopheevii is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to harsh environments."
