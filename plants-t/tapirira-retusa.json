    "intro": "Tapirira retusa, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Pouteria retusa*, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by edible, orange-red fruits resembling small cherries. The fruit contains a single seed enclosed in a fleshy, aromatic pulp, which is often consumed by various wildlife species. Tapirira retusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
