    "intro": "Telipogon ramiro-medinae, commonly known as the Medinilla orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit with small, clustered flowers. The plant produces delicate, fragrant blooms in shades of white and pink, often with a subtle greenish tinge. Its roots are specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to thrive on tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
