    "intro": "Thelymitra alcockiae, commonly known as the Alcock's sun-orchid, is an Australian terrestrial orchid belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its striking, sun-like yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained soils. Thelymitra alcockiae has a pseudobulb structure with a single leaf, and its roots are adapted for nutrient uptake in poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
