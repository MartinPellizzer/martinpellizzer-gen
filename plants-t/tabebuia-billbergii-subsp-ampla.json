    "intro": "Tabebuia billbergii subsp. ampla, commonly known as the white trumpet tree, is a deciduous tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, blooming in the dry season. The tree has a straight trunk and a broad, umbrella-like canopy, with smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and elliptical, turning yellow before falling in response to seasonal changes. The wood is valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making."
