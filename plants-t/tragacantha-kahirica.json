    "intro": "Tragacantha kahirica, commonly known as the Kahiric gum plant, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a valuable resin, known as tragacanth, which has been used historically in medicine and as a food thickener. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its ecological importance and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated for commercial use."
