    "intro": "Terpsichore exornans, commonly known as the Ornate Dancing Flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It features vibrant, bi-colored petals that shift hue with the time of day, a unique adaptation for attracting specific pollinators. Its leaves are velvety and covered in microscopic ridges that enhance water retention in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant blossoms that bloom only during the twilight hours. Botanists are particularly interested in its genetic makeup due to its unusual hybrid traits and medicinal potential."
