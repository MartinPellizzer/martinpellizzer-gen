It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often alternate along its stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white, actinomorphic flowers in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable component of native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
