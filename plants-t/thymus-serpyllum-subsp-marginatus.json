    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum subsp. marginatus, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its foliage is often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its essential oils and antimicrobial properties. This subspecies is closely related to common thyme but can be distinguished by its narrower leaves and slightly different floral structure."
