    "intro": "Tristylium ochnaceum, commonly known as the three-styled ochna, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Ochnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive three stamens and a single pistil, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with showy petals that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. The leaves are simple and alternate, often with a slightly waxy surface that helps reduce water loss."
