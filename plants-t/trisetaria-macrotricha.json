    "intro": "Trisetaria macrotricha, commonly known as the tall hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Trisetaria macrotricha plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
