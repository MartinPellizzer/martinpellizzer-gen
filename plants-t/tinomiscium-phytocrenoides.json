This plant is characterized by its vibrant yellow inflorescences, which consist of both ray and disk flowers, creating a visually appealing display. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and marshes. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for various pollinators and its ecological importance in maintaining wetland biodiversity."
