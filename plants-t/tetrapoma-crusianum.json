    "intro": "Tetrapoma crusianum, commonly known as the Crimson Ghostflower, is a strikingly unique plant native to the arid regions of central and southern Africa. It is characterized by its vivid red, ghost-like blooms that appear during the dry season, often in clusters along rocky outcrops. The plant has a succulent, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, minimizing water loss through transpiration. The species is adapted to full sun exposure and thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils."
