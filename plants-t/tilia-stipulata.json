    "intro": "Tilia stipulata, commonly known as the stipule maple, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that have stipules at the base, giving it its scientific name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow furrows appearing as the tree matures. Tilia stipulata is often grown for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable climates."
