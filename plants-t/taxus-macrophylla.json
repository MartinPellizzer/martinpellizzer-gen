    "intro": "Taxus macrophylla, commonly known as the Chinese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to China. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fleshy red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. The plant has scale-like leaves that are arranged in flat sprays, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Taxus macrophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and longevity. Its wood is also historically used in the production of medicinal compounds, though it is not as well-known as other Taxus species."
