    "intro": "Trichosanthes tricuspidata f. asperifolia, commonly known as the rough-flowered trumpet vine, is a variant of the Trichosanthes genus native to Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, warty, and rough-textured stems and leaves, which give it its specific epithet \"asperifolia.\" The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers with a trumpet-shaped corolla, often with a distinctive red or orange throat. It is a climbing vine that thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The fruit is a long, green, ribbed capsule that matures into a spiny, orange-red structure."
