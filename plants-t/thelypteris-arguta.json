    "intro": "Thelypteris arguta, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris arguta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, feathery appearance."
