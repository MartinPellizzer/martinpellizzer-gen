    "intro": "Thecocarpus carvifolius, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 6 meters. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing spores on the underside of its fronds rather than flowers. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and facilitating nutrient absorption. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas."
