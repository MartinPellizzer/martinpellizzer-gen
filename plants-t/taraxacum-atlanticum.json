    "intro": "Taraxacum atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of Atlantic Canada. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open habitats. Taraxacum atlanticum is a hardy species that plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity."
