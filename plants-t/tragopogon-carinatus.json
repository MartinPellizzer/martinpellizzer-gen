    "intro": "Tragopogon carinatus, commonly known as the crowned wheatgrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and distinctive, yellowish-green leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by seed heads that resemble miniature wheat ears. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Tragopogon carinatus is often considered a weed but is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
