    "intro": "Tarasa operculata, commonly known as the operculate tarasa, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive operculum, a cap-like structure that covers the flower bud before it opens. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually ovate or elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are showy, often with a vibrant coloration, and play a role in attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
