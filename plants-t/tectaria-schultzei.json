    "intro": "Tectaria schultzei, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-like fronds that are typically divided into segments with a unique, often toothed or lobed appearance. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Tectaria schultzei thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
