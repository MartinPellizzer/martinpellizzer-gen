    "intro": "Tontanea repens, commonly known as the creeping tontanea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to certain regions of South America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or pale yellow, often clustered in the axils of the leaves. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Tontanea repens is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in forest understories."
