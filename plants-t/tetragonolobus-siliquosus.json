    "intro": "Tetragonolobus siliquosus, commonly known as the four-angled siliquous legume, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes many legumes characterized by their distinctive pod-like fruits. The plant is notable for its quadrangular stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typical features of the genus Tetragonolobus. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with a pea-like structure, and it produces elongated, woody pods that contain the seeds. This species is often found in grassland habitats and can be used in traditional medicine or as a forage plant."
