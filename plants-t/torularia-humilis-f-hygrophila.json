    "intro": "Torularia humilis f. hygrophila, commonly known as the water-tolerant form of the genus Torularia, is a flowering plant characterized by its compact growth habit and small, white to pale yellow flowers. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is native to regions with moist or wet habitats. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences that bloom during the summer months. This variety is notable for its adaptability to waterlogged soils and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
