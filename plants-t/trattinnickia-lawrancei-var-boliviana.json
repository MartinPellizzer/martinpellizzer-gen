    "intro": "[WRONG START] Trattinnickia lawrencei var. boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of Bolivia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a fine pubescence, while its stems are erect and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
