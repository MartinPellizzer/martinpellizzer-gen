It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous, and the sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris christensenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
