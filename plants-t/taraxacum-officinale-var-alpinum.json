    "intro": "Taraxacum officinale var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are spoon-shaped and arranged in a basal cluster. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer, followed by a fluffy seed head that disperses seeds via the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to withstand cold temperatures, making it a characteristic species of high-altitude environments."
