    "intro": "Taraxacum lutheri, commonly known as the Luther's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to parts of Europe and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy seed head. The plant is perennial and typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a taproot system and is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
