It is native to Mexico and Central America, where it thrives in warm, sunny climates. The plant is characterized by its bright orange to red inflorescences, which are composed of numerous small yellow to orange flowers. Tithonia species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their vibrant colors and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Additionally, some species are cultivated as forage crops for livestock due to their nutritional value."
