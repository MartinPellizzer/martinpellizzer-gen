    "intro": "Tillandsia ramealis, commonly known as the silver rosette tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant forms a dense, silver-gray rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires good air circulation. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
