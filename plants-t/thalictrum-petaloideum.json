    "intro": "Thalictrum petaloideum, commonly known as the showy avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white, petal-like bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish-yellow true flowers in the center of the bract clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Thalictrum petaloideum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
