    "intro": "Tritomodon longilobus, commonly known as the long-lobe waterwheel plant, is a species of aquatic flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves and its ability to thrive in slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Tritomodon longilobus plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland habitats."
