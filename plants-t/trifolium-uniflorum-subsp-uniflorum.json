    "intro": "Trifolium uniflorum subsp. uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flowered clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
