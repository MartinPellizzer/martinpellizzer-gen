It is characterized by its pendulous clusters of fragrant, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has elliptical, dark green leaves that are glossy and arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
