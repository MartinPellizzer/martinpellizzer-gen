    "intro": "Takhtajanianthus, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Boraginaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers, which are often tubular in shape and arranged in clusters. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Takhtajanianthus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
