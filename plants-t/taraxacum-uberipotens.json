It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped basal leaves and a tall, hollow stem that supports a single, showy yellow flower head. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in meadows and grassy areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via the characteristic parachute-like structures called pappus. This species is notable for its robust growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
