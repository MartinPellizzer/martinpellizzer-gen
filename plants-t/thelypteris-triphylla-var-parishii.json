    "intro": "Thelypteris triphylla var. parishii, commonly known as the Parish's shield fern, is a fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to the soil. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive shield-like shape that gives it its common name."
