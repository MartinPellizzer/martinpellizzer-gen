    "intro": "Taeniophyllum orthorhynchum, commonly known as the slender-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It has small, leathery leaves and produces white, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded in the host's bark. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystems it inhabits."
