    "intro": "Trifolium simense f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered clover, is a botanical variant of the common clover species. It is characterized by its distinctive white flowers, which contrast with the typical green or pink blooms of other clover varieties. This plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. The trifoliate leaves, composed of three leaflets, are a defining feature of the genus Trifolium. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas."
