    "intro": "Tyria myricifolia, commonly known as the myrtleleaf tyria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Onagraceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as swampy areas and along stream banks. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or white, and it has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. It is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat. Tyria myricifolia plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the health of wetland ecosystems."
