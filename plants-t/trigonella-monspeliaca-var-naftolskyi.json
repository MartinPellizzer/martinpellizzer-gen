    "intro": "Trigonella monspeliaca var. naftolskyi, commonly known as the Naftolsky fenugreek, is a rare variant of the fenugreek plant native to specific regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant produces slender, hairy stems that often grow close to the ground. Its seeds, like those of other fenugreek species, are rich in nutrients and have been used in traditional medicine. This variety is notable for its unique genetic traits and limited distribution, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
