    "intro": "Tristania, commonly known as the \"Tristania tree\" or \"Tristania shrub,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The leaves are typically opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy surface, while the flowers are often clustered in inflorescences. Tristania species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their attractive appearance. Some species are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
