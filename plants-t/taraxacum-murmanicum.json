    "intro": "Taraxacum murmanicum, commonly known as the Murman dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along riverbanks. The plant features a rosette of stiff, hairy leaves that form a dense base, with a long, hollow stem that bears a single, bright yellow flower head. Its flowers develop into a distinctive crown of white, fluffy seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Taraxacum murmanicum is known for its medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and diuretic effects."
