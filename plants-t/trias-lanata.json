    "intro": "Trias lanata, commonly known as the woolly trias, is a unique plant species characterized by its dense, lanolin-like covering on its stems and leaves. This waxy coating, known as lanata, serves as a natural defense mechanism against desiccation and herbivory. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, with a silvery or grayish hue due to the thick cuticle. Trias lanata is often found in rocky or mountainous regions, where it adapts to harsh climatic conditions."
