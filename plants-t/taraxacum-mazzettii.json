    "intro": "Taraxacum mazzettii, commonly known as the Mazzetti's dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive seed dispersal mechanism. The plant features a basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. Its flowers are typically followed by a crown of bracts that form the characteristic \"parachute\" seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Taraxacum mazzettii is adapted to rocky and alpine environments, exhibiting a range of morphological variations depending on its habitat."
