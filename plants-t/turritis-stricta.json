    "intro": "Turritis stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf turritis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Turritis stricta is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
