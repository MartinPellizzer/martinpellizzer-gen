    "intro": "Tephrosia texana, commonly known as Texas tephrosia, is a perennial legume native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seed pods are slender and hairy, containing small, hard seeds. Tephrosia texana is often found in open woods, prairies, and along roadsides, and it plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its legume classification."
