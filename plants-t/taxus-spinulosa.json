    "intro": "Taxus spinulosa, commonly known as the spinous yew, is a species of evergreen conifer native to China. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the stems. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds, which aid in seed dispersal. Taxus spinulosa is a slow-growing shrub that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and hardy nature."
