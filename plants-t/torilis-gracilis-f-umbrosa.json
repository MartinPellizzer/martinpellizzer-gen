    "intro": "Torilis gracilis f. umbrosa, commonly known as the slender false nettle, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, opposite leaves. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The leaves are usually lance-shaped with a hairy surface, and the plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is often found in temperate regions. This variety is distinguished by its more upright growth habit compared to the typical form of Torilis gracilis."
