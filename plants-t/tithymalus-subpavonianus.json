    "intro": "Tithymalus subpavonianus, commonly known as the Pavonian tithymalus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in umbels. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this species thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
