    "intro": "Trichosalpinx diazii, commonly known as the Mexican ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests, often on tree trunks or branches. It has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, a feature common among epiphytic orchids. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Trichosalpinx diazii is considered a threatened species."
