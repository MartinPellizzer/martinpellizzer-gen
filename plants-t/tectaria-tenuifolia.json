    "intro": "Tectaria tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that often form a compact rosette. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically arranged in lines. Tectaria tenuifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in botanical studies."
