    "intro": "Tococa roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima tococa, is a climbing shrub native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in the humid, nutrient-poor soils of the rocky highlands. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
