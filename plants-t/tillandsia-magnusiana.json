    "intro": "Tillandsia magnusiana, commonly known as the Magnusiana air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. This species is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often covered in a dense layer of trichomes that help absorb moisture from the air. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
