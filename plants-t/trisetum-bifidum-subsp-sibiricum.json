    "intro": "Trisetum bifidum subsp. sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the colder regions of Eurasia. It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as meadows, grasslands, and forest edges. The plant has slender, tufted stems with dense, sharp spikelets that give it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant traits. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
