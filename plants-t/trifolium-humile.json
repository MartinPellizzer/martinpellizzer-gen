    "intro": "Trifolium humile, commonly known as the lesser clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to ovate leaflets, often with a distinctive white or pale violet bloom. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are clustered in loose spikes, and it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Trifolium humile is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through its root nodules, enriching the soil. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
