    "intro": "Triticum speltiforme, commonly known as spelt wheat, is an ancient grain species belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its compact, spikelet-like inflorescence and glumes that enclose the florets. The plant produces small, hard grains that are rich in protein and nutrients. It is typically grown in temperate climates and has a shorter growing season compared to modern wheat varieties. Its botanical features make it distinct from common wheat, with a unique genetic makeup that contributes to its historical and agricultural significance."
