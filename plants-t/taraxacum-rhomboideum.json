    "intro": "Taraxacum rhomboideum, commonly known as the rhomboid dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, showy yellow flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk flowers, which are typical of the dandelion genus. It produces a distinctive seed head with pappus-covered seeds that are dispersed by wind. This plant is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is native to parts of Europe and Asia."
