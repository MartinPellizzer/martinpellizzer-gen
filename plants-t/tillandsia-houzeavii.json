    "intro": "Tillandsia houzeavii, commonly known as the Houzea tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features compact rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. It produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
