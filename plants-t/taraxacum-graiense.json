    "intro": "Taraxacum graiense, commonly known as the Graian dandelion, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces a hollow, wind-dispersed seed stem known as a pappus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Taraxacum graiense is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
