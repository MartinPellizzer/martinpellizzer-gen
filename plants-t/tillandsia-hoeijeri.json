    "intro": "Tillandsia hoeijeri, commonly known as the Orange Ghost, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically orange or red, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. Tillandsia hoeijeri is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
