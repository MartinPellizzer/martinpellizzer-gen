It is characterized by its floating leaves and spiny, club-shaped fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments with muddy substrates. Its reproductive structures are adapted for dispersal by water, allowing it to spread across wetlands and lakes. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
