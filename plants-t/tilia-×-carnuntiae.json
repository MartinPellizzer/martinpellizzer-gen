    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 carnuntiae, commonly known as the Carpathian lime, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Tilia cordata and Tilia platyphyllos. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It is native to the Carpathian region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. This tree is often valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to provide shade in urban and woodland settings."
