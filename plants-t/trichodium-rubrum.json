    "intro": "Trichodium rubrum, commonly known as the red moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. The plant has a distinctive appearance with bright red or orange stems and leaves that are usually narrow and closely arranged. Trichodium rubrum is known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions due to its thick, waxy cuticle that reduces water loss. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
