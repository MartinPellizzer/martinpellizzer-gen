    "intro": "Triticum rigidum var. ruthenicum, commonly known as the Ruthenian wild rye, is a grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
