    "intro": "Trifolium fluminense, commonly known as river clover, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other riparian areas. Trifolium fluminense is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
