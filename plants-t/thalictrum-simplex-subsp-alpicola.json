    "intro": "Thalictrum simplex subsp. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine meadow rue, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features slender stems and delicate, compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in racemes, usually appearing in shades of white or pale yellow. It plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
