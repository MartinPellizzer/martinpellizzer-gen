    "intro": "Tripogon major subsp. major, commonly known as the giant tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and dense, tufted growth habit, forming large tussocks in open habitats. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its robust nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
