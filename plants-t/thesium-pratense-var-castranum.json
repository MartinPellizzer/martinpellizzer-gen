    "intro": "Thesium pratense var. castranum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thesium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, producing small, yellowish blooms. This variety is characterized by its reduced leaf size and compact growth form compared to other thesium species."
