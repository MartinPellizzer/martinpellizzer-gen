    "intro": "Taraxacum janchenii, commonly known as the Janchen's dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, prominent flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk florets, which are typical of the dandelion genus. This species is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is adapted to rocky and arid environments. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization."
