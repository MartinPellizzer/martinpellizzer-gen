    "intro": "Tulipa gesneriana var. spathulata, commonly known as the Franklinia tulip, is a striking perennial bulbous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range from pink to red, with a distinctive, broad, spatulate shape. The plant produces strap-like leaves that are broad and slightly pointed, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. However, it is relatively rare in the wild and is often cultivated for its beauty and historical significance."
