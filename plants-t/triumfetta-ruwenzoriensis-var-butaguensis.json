    "intro": "Triumfetta ruwenzoriensis var. butaguensis, commonly known as the Butagweni triumfetta, is a rare shrub native to the mountainous regions of Uganda. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus plants. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
