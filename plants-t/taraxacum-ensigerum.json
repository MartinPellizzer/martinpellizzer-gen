    "intro": "Taraxacum ensigerum, commonly known as the New Zealand dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a yellow composite flower head. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments and is often found in forest margins and wetlands. Its flowers produce wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its spread within its native habitat. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations and ecological role in New Zealand's flora."
