    "intro": "Timonius ridleyi, commonly known as the Malayan orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Timonius ridleyi is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
