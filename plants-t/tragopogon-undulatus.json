    "intro": "Tragopogon undulatus, commonly known as the zigzagged goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its distinctive, yellow, dandelion-like flowers. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces a long, slender seed stalk that curves in a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, and is often found in dry, sunny environments. Tragopogon undulatus is also known for its ability to hybridize with other species in the genus, contributing to the diversity of the Tragopogon complex."
