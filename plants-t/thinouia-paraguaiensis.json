    "intro": "Thinouia paraguaiensis, commonly known as yerba mate, is a climbing plant native to South America, particularly in Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by elliptical, winged fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are traditionally used to prepare a stimulating beverage, which has been an important cultural and economic resource for indigenous and local communities. The plant's botanical features make it well adapted to the humid, tropical environments of its native range."
