    "intro": "Taraxacum hallaisanense, commonly known as the Hallaisan dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the Korean Peninsula and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a hollow, hairy stem. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a white, spherical seed head with parachute-like seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
