    "intro": "Tillandsia acaulis var. zonata, commonly known as the Zonate Air Plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette pattern, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces striking inflorescences with colorful, showy flowers that attract pollinators. It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
