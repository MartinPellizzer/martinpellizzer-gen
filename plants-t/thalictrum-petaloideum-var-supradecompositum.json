    "intro": "Thalictrum petaloideum var. supradecompositum, commonly known as the pink meadow rue, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as meadows and forest edges. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
