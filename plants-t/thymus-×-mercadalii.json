    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 mercadalii, commonly known as hybrid thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It is a hybrid between Thymus serpyllum and Thymus vulgaris, resulting in a plant with dense, aromatic foliage. The leaves are small, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It produces small, pink to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its use in culinary and medicinal applications."
