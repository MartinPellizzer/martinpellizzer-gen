    "intro": "Thrixspermum pianmaense, commonly known as the Pianma endemic thrixspermum, is a rare flowering plant native to the Yunnan province in China. It belongs to the family Dipsacaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and mountainous areas, showcasing adaptations to its harsh, high-altitude environment. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
