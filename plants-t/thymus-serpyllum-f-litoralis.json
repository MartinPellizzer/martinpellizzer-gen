    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. litoralis, commonly known as sea thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salty sea air and coastal conditions. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in coastal gardens and as a ground cover in rocky or dry landscapes."
