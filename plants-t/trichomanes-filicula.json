    "intro": "Trichomanes filicula, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows on moist, shaded rock surfaces or tree trunks, thriving in humid environments. Its leaves are usually light green and have a distinctive, lace-like appearance. Trichomanes filicula is often found in epiphytic conditions, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic."
