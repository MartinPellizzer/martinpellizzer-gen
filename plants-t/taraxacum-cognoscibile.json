    "intro": "Taraxacum cognoscibile, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, showy flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which develop into the familiar white, parachute-like seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its diuretic and digestive benefits."
