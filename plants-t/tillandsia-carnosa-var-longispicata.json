    "intro": "Tillandsia carnosa var. longispicata, commonly known as the long-spined air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are usually pink or red, and it produces small, white, spore-bearing structures called spathes. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
