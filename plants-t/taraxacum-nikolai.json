    "intro": "Taraxacum nikolai, commonly known as Nikolai's dandelion, is a flowering plant species native to Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated leaves and a single, hollow stem that supports a yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a pappus, which allows its seeds to be carried by the wind. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
