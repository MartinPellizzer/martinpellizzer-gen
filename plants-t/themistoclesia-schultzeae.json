    "intro": "Themistoclesia schultzeae, commonly known as the Schultze's ghostflower, is a rare and striking member of the Onagraceae family. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Chile, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant has a short life cycle, often completing its growth and reproduction within a single growing season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
