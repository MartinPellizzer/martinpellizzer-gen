    "intro": "Trifolium tomentosum, commonly known as the hairy clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval, hairy, and often glandular leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Trifolium tomentosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
