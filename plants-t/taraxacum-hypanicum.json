    "intro": "Taraxacum hypanicum, commonly known as the Spanish dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a spherical seed head. Native to southern Europe and North Africa, it thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. The plant is known for its taproot system and its ability to produce a large number of lightweight seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is often considered a weed but has some traditional uses in herbal medicine."
