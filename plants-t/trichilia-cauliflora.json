    "intro": "Trichilia cauliflora, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its cauliflorous flowering habit, where flowers and fruits develop directly on the trunk and branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by round, orange or yellow fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
