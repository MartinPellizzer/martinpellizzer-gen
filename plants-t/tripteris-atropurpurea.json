    "intro": "Tripteris atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple-leaf tripteris, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its dark purple to black foliage, which becomes more intense during the cooler months. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by winged seeds, typical of the Meliaceae family. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
