    "intro": "Thelypteris peekelii, commonly known as the Peekel's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that form a compact, shield-like rosette. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a glossy appearance, with a distinct, serrated margin. Thelypteris peekelii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
