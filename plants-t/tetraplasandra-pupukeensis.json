    "intro": "Tetraplasandra pupukeensis, commonly known as the Kauri fig, is a rare and endemic tree species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically glabrous and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits that are an important food source for native wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes. Its botanical features make it a unique component of New Zealand's ecological diversity."
