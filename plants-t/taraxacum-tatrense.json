    "intro": "Taraxacum tatrense, commonly known as the Tatran dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant features basal rosettes of spoon-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and its stem is usually hairy. It produces a yellow flower head that develops into a ball of white pappus, aiding in wind dispersal of its seeds. Taraxacum tatrense thrives in rocky and grassy habitats at high elevations, adapting to harsh alpine conditions."
