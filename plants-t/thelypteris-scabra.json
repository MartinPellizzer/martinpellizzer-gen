    "intro": "Thelypteris scabra, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its serrated, rough-textured fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris scabra is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in botanical studies and horticulture."
