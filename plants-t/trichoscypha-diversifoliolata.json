    "intro": "Trichoscypha diversifoliolata, commonly known as the African sandpaper tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, sandpaper-like texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The tree is valued for its ornamental appearance and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
