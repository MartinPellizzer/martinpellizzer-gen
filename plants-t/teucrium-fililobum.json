It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often aromatic. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or dry habitats. Teucrium fililobum is also valued for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies."
