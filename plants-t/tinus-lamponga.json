    "intro": "Tinus lamponga, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. The plant produces striking red or pink flowers with a distinctive spurred shape, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, providing structural support and efficient water retention. Tinus lamponga is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
