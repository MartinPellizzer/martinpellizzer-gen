    "intro": "Thysselinum crouanorum, commonly known as the Crouan's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of southern France. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in salty and well-drained conditions. The plant features a robust, upright stem with spiny leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a single head, and bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
