It belongs to the dandelion family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds, typical of the genus Taraxacum. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions."
