    "intro": "Tephroseris integrifolia subsp. karsiana, commonly known as the Karsian lichen, is a member of the Parmeliaceae family and is characterized by its crustose growth form. It typically grows on bark and stone in forested areas, especially in temperate and subarctic regions. The thallus is pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinct, uneven surface. It lacks true leaves but has a complex structure of algae and fungi that form a symbiotic relationship. This subspecies is notable for its chemical composition, which includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role."
