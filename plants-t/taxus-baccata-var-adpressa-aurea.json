    "intro": "Taxus baccata var. adpressa-aurea, commonly known as the golden yew, is a variant of the European yew with distinct botanical features. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and foliage that exhibits a striking golden-yellow coloration, especially in younger leaves. The plant retains its leaves throughout the winter, providing year-round visual interest. Its small, dark blue berries are similar to those of the common yew, though they are less showy. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
