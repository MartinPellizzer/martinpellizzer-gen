    "intro": "Trichocereus arboricola, commonly known as the \"Poker Plant,\" is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that often branch out into a tree-like structure, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of white, night-blooming flowers that are highly fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators. It has a slow growth rate and requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect sunlight to thrive. Due to its striking appearance and unique blooming habits, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
