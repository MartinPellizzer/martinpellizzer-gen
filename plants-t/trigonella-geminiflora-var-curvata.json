    "intro": "Trigonella geminiflora var. curvata, commonly known as the curly-flowered fenugreek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branched stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that are arranged in a unique spiral pattern, giving it its common name. Its seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to regular fenugreek. The botanical characteristics of this variety make it distinct from other Trigonella species, particularly in its floral structure and growth habit."
