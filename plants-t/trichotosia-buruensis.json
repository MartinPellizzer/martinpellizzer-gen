    "intro": "Trichotosia buruensis, commonly known as the Buru lily, is a flowering plant native to the island of Buru in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by the development of hard, woody fruits. Trichotosia buruensis is notable for its ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various local fauna. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
