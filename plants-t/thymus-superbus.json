    "intro": "Thymus superbus, commonly known as mountain thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage and small, aromatic leaves that are often used in cooking and traditional medicine. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Thymus superbus is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties, including its antimicrobial and antioxidant compounds."
