    "intro": "Taraxacum altaicum, commonly known as the Altai dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of deeply lobed, hairy leaves and a long, hollow stem that bears a single flower head. The plant produces a bright yellow composite flower that develops into a spherical seed head with pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Taraxacum altaicum is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional remedies for its anti-inflammatory and detoxifying effects."
