    "intro": "Triumfetta inermis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas, where it can become a weed. Triumfetta inermis is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
