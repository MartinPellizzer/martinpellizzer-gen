    "intro": "Toxicodendron radicans subsp. eximium, commonly known as the Southern poison ivy, is a variant of the poison ivy plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged oppositely along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and reddish-brown berries that are dispersed by birds. It contains urushiol, a toxic resin that causes skin irritation in many people. This subspecies is often found in wooded areas and along the edges of forests, where it thrives in partial shade."
