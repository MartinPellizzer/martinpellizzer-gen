    "intro": "Trifolium repens, commonly known as white clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a slender stem. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. White clover thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides. It is a legume, capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
