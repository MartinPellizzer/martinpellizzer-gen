    "intro": "Trichomanes millefolium, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are divided into numerous small, pointed segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a layer of fine, thread-like roots, which help anchor it in the soil. Trichomanes millefolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its graceful appearance."
