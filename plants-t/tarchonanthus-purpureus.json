    "intro": "Tarchonanthus purpureus, commonly known as the purple conebush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often found in the fynbos biome. The plant produces showy, purple to pink flowers that bloom in winter, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
