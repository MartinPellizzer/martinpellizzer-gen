    "intro": "Tragia gardneri, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom during the warmer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Tragia gardneri is well-suited to harsh environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides."
