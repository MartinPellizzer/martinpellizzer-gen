    "intro": "Teramnus repens, commonly known as the creeping teramnus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Teramnus repens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
