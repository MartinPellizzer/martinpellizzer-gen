It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Tetratome lepidota is an important species in ecological studies due to its role in supporting local biodiversity."
