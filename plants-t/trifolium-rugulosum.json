    "intro": "Trifolium rugulosum, commonly known as the rough trefoil, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typical of many members of the legume family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. Trifolium rugulosum is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
