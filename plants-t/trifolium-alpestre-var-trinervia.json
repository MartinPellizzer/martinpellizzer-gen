    "intro": "Trifolium alpestre var. trinervia, commonly known as the alpine trifoliate clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being narrow and slightly hairy, with a distinctive three-veined structure. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pink or red, blooming in early summer. This variety is noted for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments."
