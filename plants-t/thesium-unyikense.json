    "intro": "Thesium unyikense, commonly known as the mountain thesium, is a flowering plant species native to the montane regions of East Africa. It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on long, slender peduncles. Thesium unyikense is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
