    "intro": "Tractema liliohyacinthus, commonly known as the hyacinth bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, hyacinth-like flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of purple, pink, and white. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are used both as food and for ornamental purposes. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant thrives in warm, humid climates. Tractema liliohyacinthus is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and edible seeds."
