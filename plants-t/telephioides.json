    "intro": "Telephioides, commonly known as the mountain snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Telephioides is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
