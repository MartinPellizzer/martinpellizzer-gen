    "intro": "Tragiola pilosa subsp. typica, commonly known as the hairy tragi, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, spiny leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It is adapted to survive in drought conditions, storing water in its succulent stems. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in its native habitat."
