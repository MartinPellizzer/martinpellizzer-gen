    "intro": "Trisetum alpestre var. viviparum-macranthum, commonly known as the alpine blue grass, is a variant of the alpine blue grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments such as mountain meadows and alpine tundra. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. The variety viviparum-macranthum is distinguished by its viviparous reproduction, where seedlings develop on the parent plant before detaching."
