    "intro": "Teucrium pyrenaicum var. catalaunicum, commonly known as the Catalan germander, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and slightly different morphological features compared to the typical form of Teucrium pyrenaicum."
