    "intro": "Tillandsia balbisiana, commonly known as the Balbisiana air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has strap-like, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
