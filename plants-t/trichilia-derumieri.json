It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other economically important timber species. The plant is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and white, arranged in spherical clusters that resemble snowballs, giving it its common name. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
