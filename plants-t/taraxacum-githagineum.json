It features a rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces a single, tall, yellow flower head that blooms in spring and summer. Its roots are tuberous and can store nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry environments."
