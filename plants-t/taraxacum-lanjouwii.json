    "intro": "Taraxacum lanjouwii, commonly known as the Lanjouw dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a single, hollow, hairless stem that supports a bright yellow flower head. The plant is native to China, specifically the Yunnan province, and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its flowers produce small, wind-dispersed seeds with white pappus, aiding in its propagation. Taraxacum lanjouwii is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native habitat."
