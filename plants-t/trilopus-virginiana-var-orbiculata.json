    "intro": "Trilopus virginiana var. orbiculata, commonly known as the orbiculate trailing arum, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spadix, enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
