    "intro": "Tridophyllum decandrum, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using limited chlorophyll. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, often leading to reduced growth or even death of the host tree. Tridophyllum decandrum is found in Australia and is an example of a plant that has adapted to a parasitic lifestyle in a specialized ecological niche."
