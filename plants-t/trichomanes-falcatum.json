    "intro": "Trichomanes falcatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its creeping rhizome. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including parts of China, India, and Southeast Asia. Its fronds are often dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its humid habitats. Trichomanes falcatum is often found growing in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
