    "intro": "Tarachia palmata, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry environments. Tarachia palmata plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat."
