    "intro": "Taraxacum hypochoeropsis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, upright stem that terminates in a yellow flower head. Native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, this plant thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and disturbed areas. Its life cycle includes a period of dormancy during winter, with flowering typically occurring in spring. The plant is often found in open environments where it can compete effectively with other vegetation."
