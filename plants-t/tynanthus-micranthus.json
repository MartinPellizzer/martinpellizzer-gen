    "intro": "Tynanthus micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces long, bean-like pods that contain toxic seeds, which are a concern for livestock. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental tree in warmer climates. The botanical features of Tynanthus micranthus make it both visually striking and ecologically significant in its native habitat."
