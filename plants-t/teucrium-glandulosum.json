    "intro": "Teucrium glandulosum, commonly known as sticky germander, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. The plant features slender, aromatic stems covered in glandular hairs, which give it its common name. Its small, tubular flowers are usually purple or blue and bloom in summer. The leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and emit a strong, often minty scent when crushed."
