    "intro": "Thelypteris guamensis, commonly known as Guam holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and often have a waxy texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky or coastal substrates. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern life cycle. Thelypteris guamensis plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability in its native habitat."
