    "intro": "Trichomanes badium, commonly known as the moss fern, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes badium plays a minor but important role in maintaining soil moisture and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
