    "intro": "Trifolium lagopus, commonly known as the mountain clover, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Trifolium lagopus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native environments."
