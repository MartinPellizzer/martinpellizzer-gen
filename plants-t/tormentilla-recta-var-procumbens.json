    "intro": "Tormentilla recta var. procumbens, commonly known as creeping tormentil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a creeping habit, with stems that root at the nodes, forming a mat-like growth. Its leaves are alternate, with a distinctive shield-like shape and a rough, hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
