    "intro": "Telipogon tungurahuae, commonly known as the Tungurahua orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has a short, erect stem with a single, narrow leaf and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human activity."
