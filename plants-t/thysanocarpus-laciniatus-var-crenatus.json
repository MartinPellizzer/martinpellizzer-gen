    "intro": "Thysanocarpus laciniatus var. crenatus, commonly known as the serrated thysanocarpus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, a feature typical of the genus Thysanocarpus. The varietal form crenatus is distinguished by its coarsely toothed leaf margins, setting it apart from other varieties of the species."
