    "intro": "Tragacantha pallida, commonly known as the pale tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a unique, sticky resin known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Tragacantha pallida thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
