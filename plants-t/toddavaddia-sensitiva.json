    "intro": "Toddavaddia sensitiva, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate leaves that rapidly fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae and is known for its rapid movement, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers are typically pink or purple and bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant's unique behavior and aesthetic appeal make it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture."
