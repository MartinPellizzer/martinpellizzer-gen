    "intro": "Thalictrum terrae-novae, commonly known as the Newfoundland meadow rue, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Newfoundland and Labrador. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils along shorelines and in open woodlands. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many showy and often toxic plants. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native environment."
