    "intro": "Taraxacum arrectum, commonly known as the upright dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, tall flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disc of tubular florets, which develop into seeds with white, feathery parachutes. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been naturalized in many regions around the world. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas."
