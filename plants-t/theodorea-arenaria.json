    "intro": "Theodorea arenaria, commonly known as the sand dune lily, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Theodorea arenaria plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
