    "intro": "Trigonella torta, commonly known as the twisted senna, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, twisted pods that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its unique, spiral-shaped seed pods. Trigonella torta is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, Mediterranean climates. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological studies and traditional herbal medicine."
