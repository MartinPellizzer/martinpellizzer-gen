It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically pale green with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
