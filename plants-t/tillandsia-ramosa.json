    "intro": "Tillandsia ramosa, commonly known as the ramose air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple and bloom in clusters at the ends of its stems. Tillandsia ramosa is known for its ability to absorb moisture through its leaves, making it well adapted to its natural habitat."
