    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. subayachicus, commonly known as the subalpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, fragrant, grey-green leaves that are densely packed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in subalpine and alpine meadows. Due to its aromatic properties, it is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies and as a culinary herb."
