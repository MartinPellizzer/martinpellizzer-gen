    "intro": "Tetrorchidiopsis minor, commonly known as the small tetrorchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a raceme, and they bloom during the late spring to early summer months. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
