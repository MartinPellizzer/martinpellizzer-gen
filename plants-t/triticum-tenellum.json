    "intro": "Triticum tenellum, commonly known as slender wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinctive blue-green coloration. Triticum tenellum is primarily of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic relationship to cultivated wheat species."
