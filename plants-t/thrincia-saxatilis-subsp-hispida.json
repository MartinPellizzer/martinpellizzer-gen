    "intro": "Thrincia saxatilis subsp. hispida, commonly known as the rough thrincia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and alpine environments in southern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The subspecies hispida is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which helps protect it from desiccation in harsh conditions. It typically grows in well-drained soils on slopes and cliffs, often forming dense mats. This plant is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique adaptations and ornamental value."
