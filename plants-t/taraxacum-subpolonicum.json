It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a yellow flowering head that develops into a fluffy white pappus for seed dispersal. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has a taproot system and is known for its ability to tolerate various environmental conditions. It is often considered a weed but also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
