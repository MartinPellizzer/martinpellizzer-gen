    "intro": "Taraxacum ichmadophilum, commonly known as the Kashmirian dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a tall, hollow stem that bears a single flowering head. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that develop into white, fluffy seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It is native to the Himalayan regions of India and Pakistan, thriving in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
