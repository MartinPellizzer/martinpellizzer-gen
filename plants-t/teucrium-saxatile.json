It typically grows in dry, sunny environments such as limestone soils and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are often grayish-green in color. Its flowers are usually blue or purple, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and bloom from late spring to early summer.
