    "intro": "Tragopogon mutabilis, commonly known as the common goatsbeard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy yellow flowers that open in the morning and close in the evening. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem and has basal leaves that are narrow and grass-like. Its seeds are surrounded by a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Tragopogon mutabilis is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and it is known for its rapid growth and adaptability."
