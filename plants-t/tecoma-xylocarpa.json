    "intro": "Tecoma xylocarpa, commonly known as the yellow bell, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Caribbean. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in natural habitats."
