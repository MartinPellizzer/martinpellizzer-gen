    "intro": "Thedachloa annua, commonly known as the annual dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, thread-like stem that wraps around its host. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new hosts quickly. It is often found in agricultural fields where it can cause significant damage to crops. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat."
