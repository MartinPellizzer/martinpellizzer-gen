It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its fibrous roots and dense growth habit make it an important species for soil stabilization and ecological restoration."
