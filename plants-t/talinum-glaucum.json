It features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming from summer to fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields.
