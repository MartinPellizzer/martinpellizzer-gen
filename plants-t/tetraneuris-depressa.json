    "intro": "Tetraneuris depressa, commonly known as the low flaxweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are generally narrow and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disk. Tetraneuris depressa is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
