    "intro": "Tubiflora acaulis, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that are often blue-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy seed heads resembling dandelion fluff. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
