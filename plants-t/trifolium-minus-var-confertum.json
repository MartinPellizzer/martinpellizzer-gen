    "intro": "Trifolium minus var. confertum, commonly known as the dense clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed habitats. Due to its compact growth habit and dense foliage, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening or as a cover crop."
