It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in woodland and savanna habitats.
