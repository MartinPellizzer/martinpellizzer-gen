    "intro": "Tetrapoma pyriforme, commonly known as the four-lobed liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a flattened, lobed body that resembles a liver, hence its common name. Its leaves are closely appressed to the thallus and are often covered in a layer of mucilage. Tetrapoma pyriforme is characterized by its ability to thrive in humid conditions and its role as an indicator species for certain ecological habitats."
