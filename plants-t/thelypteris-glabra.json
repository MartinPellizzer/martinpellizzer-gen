    "intro": "Thelypteris glabra, commonly known as the smooth maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically dark green and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a defining feature of ferns. Thelypteris glabra thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its elegant appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
