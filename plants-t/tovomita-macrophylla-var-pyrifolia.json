    "intro": "Tovomita macrophylla var. pyrifolia, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by orange to red fruits that split open to release seeds. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an invasive species in many regions outside its native range. Botanically, it is characterized by its compound leaves and a distinct, often fluted trunk."
