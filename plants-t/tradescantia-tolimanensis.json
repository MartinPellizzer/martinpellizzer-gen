    "intro": "Tradescantia tolimanensis, commonly known as the Toliman spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to violet. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It is a perennial species that produces seeds through self-pollination, contributing to its ability to thrive in its native habitat."
