    "intro": "Tragia pinnata, commonly known as the winged beggar-tick, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, winged stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has palmate leaves with three to five lobes, and it produces tiny, explosive seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Tragia pinnata is often found in disturbed soils and thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. It is sometimes considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
