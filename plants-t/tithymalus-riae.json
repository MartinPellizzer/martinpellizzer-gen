    "intro": "Tithymalus riae, commonly known as the rare alpine gentian, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Tithymalus riae is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution."
