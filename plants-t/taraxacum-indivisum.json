    "intro": "Taraxacum indivisum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairless and have a waxy coating. Its flowers are yellow and form a single composite head, which develops into a fluffy white pappus for wind dispersal. Taraxacum indivisum is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it is known for its medicinal properties."
