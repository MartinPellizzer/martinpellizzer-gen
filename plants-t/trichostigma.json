    "intro": "Trichostigma, commonly known as the silver sword, is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its rosette growth habit and silver-gray foliage. The plant features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. Trichostigma is native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico, thriving in arid and rocky environments. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
