It features small, aromatic leaves and pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and fragrant foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental and medicinal purposes. It is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in rocky or sandy environments."
