    "intro": "Thymus elenevskyi, commonly known as Elenovsky thyme, is a rare and endemic species native to the Caucasus region. It is a low-growing perennial herb with aromatic, small, gray-green leaves and pink to purple flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its essential oils contain thymol and other phenolic compounds, contributing to its medicinal and aromatic properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
