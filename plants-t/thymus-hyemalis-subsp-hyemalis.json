    "intro": "Thymus hyemalis subsp. hyemalis, commonly known as winter thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features aromatic, small, gray-green leaves with a strong thyme scent, which are used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces pink to violet flowers in clusters during late winter to early spring, making it a valuable early bloom for pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or limestone areas. Its hardy nature makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in colder climates."
