    "intro": "Tillandsia stoltenii, commonly known as the Stolten's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with vibrant red and orange flowers, which bloom after several years of growth. Its unique ability to absorb water through its leaves makes it well-suited for indoor cultivation with proper air circulation and light. Tillandsia stoltenii is popular among plant enthusiasts for its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
