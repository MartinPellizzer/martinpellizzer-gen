    "intro": "Taraxacum adustum, commonly known as the European dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a fluffy white pappus that allows seeds to be carried by the wind. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often becoming a common weed. Taraxacum adustum is known for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
