    "intro": "Teucrium polium var. decalvans, commonly known as the hairless germander, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, narrow leaves that are often grayish-green due to a dense covering of fine hairs, though the \"decalvans\" variety lacks this characteristic. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, typically in shades of blue or purple, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
