    "intro": "Tsuga canadensis minima, commonly known as the dwarf hemlock, is a small evergreen conifer native to eastern North America. It is a naturally occurring variety of the eastern hemlock, characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant features scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and silvery white underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
