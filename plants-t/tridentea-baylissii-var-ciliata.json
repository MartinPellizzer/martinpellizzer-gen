    "intro": "Tridentea baylissii var. ciliata, commonly known as the ciliated tridentea, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three distinct lobes, each with a serrated edge. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its habitat is limited to moist, shaded forest floors, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
