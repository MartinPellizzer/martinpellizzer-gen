    "intro": "Tillandsia manzanilloensis, commonly known as the Manzanillo air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees in humid environments. The plant has short, dense rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it retain moisture. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often emerging from the center of the rosette. It is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in areas with high humidity and indirect sunlight."
