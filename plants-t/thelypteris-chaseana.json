    "intro": "Thelypteris chaseana, commonly known as Chase's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a short, horizontal stem that produces both roots and new shoots. Its sori, which are clusters of sporangia, are arranged in a single row along the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris chaseana thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
