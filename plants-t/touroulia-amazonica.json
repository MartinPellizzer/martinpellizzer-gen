    "intro": "Touroulia amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded environments within the understory of the rainforest. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Touroulia amazonica plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various forest creatures."
