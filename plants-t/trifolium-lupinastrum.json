    "intro": "Trifolium lupinastrum, commonly known as the purple vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its clusters of small, purple or violet flowers. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and along roadsides. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and fixes nitrogen, enriching the soil. Trifolium lupinastrum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
