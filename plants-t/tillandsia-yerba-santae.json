    "intro": "Tillandsia yerba-santae, commonly known as the Santa Maria air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the high Andes of Peru. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from a central stem, adding ornamental value. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
