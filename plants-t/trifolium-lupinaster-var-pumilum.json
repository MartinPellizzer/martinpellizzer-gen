It typically features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, with a pale green to bluish-green coloration. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
