    "intro": "Tryphia, commonly known as the silver dollar plant, is a member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its striking, glossy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often arranged in clusters. Tryphia thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
