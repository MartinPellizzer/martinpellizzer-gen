    "intro": "Tanacetum monanthos, commonly known as the common tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and flat-topped flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are aromatic and slightly hairy. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing a distinctive, pungent scent that attracts pollinators like bees and hoverflies. Tanacetum monanthos is often found in dry meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and has been used historically for its medicinal properties."
