    "intro": "Tarachia prolongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed tarahiki, is a rare and unique cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height, often branching out into a tree-like structure. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Tarachia prolongata is adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient species in harsh desert environments."
