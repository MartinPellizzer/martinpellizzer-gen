    "intro": "Tillandsia caldasiana, commonly known as the Caldasian air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that bloom in the summer. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
