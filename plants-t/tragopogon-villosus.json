It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features a tall, hairy stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by a distinctive seed head that resembles a small, fluffy crown. Tragopogon villosus is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
