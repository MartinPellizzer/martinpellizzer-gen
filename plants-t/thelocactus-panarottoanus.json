    "intro": "Thelocactus panarottoanus, commonly known as the Panarotto's locactus, is a rare cactus species native to a restricted area in northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a thick, ribbed stem that stores water efficiently. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
