It belongs to the Tiliaceae family, which includes other members such as lindens and box elders. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Tilia spachiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
