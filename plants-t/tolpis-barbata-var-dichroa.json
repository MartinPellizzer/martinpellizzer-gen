    "intro": "Tolpis barbata var. dichroa, commonly known as the dichroous tolpis, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, with lanceolate leaves that are usually covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in terminal clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are characterized by a distinctive two-colored appearance, with the upper surface being darker than the lower surface. This variation in leaf coloration is a key identifying feature of the varietal form."
