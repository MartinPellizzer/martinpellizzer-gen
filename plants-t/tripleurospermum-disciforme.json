    "intro": "Tripleurospermum disciforme, commonly known as the common mouse-ear hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid spread and ability to colonize new areas."
