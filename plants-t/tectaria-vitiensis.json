    "intro": "Tectaria vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly in Fiji. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, and its rhizomes are often thick and fibrous. Tectaria vitiensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to forest floor litter and providing microhabitats for small organisms."
