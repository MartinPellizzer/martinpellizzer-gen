    "intro": "Tapinanthus ehlersii, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant that derives some of its nutrients from host plants. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to sub-Saharan Africa. The plant has a slender, vine-like structure with small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It lacks true leaves and relies on its host for water and minerals, while conducting photosynthesis through its stems. This unique parasitic relationship makes it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
