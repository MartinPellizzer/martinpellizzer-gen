    "intro": "Tecomanthe, commonly known as the silverleaf vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, heart-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Tecomanthe thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
