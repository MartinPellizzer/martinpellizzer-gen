    "intro": "Tilia nigra var. laxiflora, commonly known as the looseflower black maple, is a variant of the black maple tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, loosely arranged flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The leaves are heart-shaped with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. This variety is typically found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
