    "intro": "Trifolium pratense var. variegatum, commonly known as the variegated red clover, is a variant of the red clover species characterized by its distinctive leaf patterns. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a white or pale green variegation pattern. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in dense clusters, typically in the spring. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. The variegation in its leaves is due to genetic mutations and is a desirable trait in horticultural cultivation."
