    "intro": "Tillandsia tillii, commonly known as the silver vase bromeliad, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in capturing water and light. The flowers, which are typically white or yellow, emerge from the center of the rosette and bloom briefly before the plant produces offsets."
