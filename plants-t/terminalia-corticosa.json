    "intro": "Terminalia corticosa, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark that peels off in thin layers. The tree produces small, white to pale yellow flowers followed by winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a rough texture. Terminalia corticosa is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of tannins."
