    "intro": "Tillandsia zebrina, commonly known as the zebra air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, colorful inflorescences that can range from red to orange, yellow, or violet. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
