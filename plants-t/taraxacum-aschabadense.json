    "intro": "Taraxacum aschabadense, commonly known as the Ashkadary dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a single, elongated stem that terminates in a yellowish composite flower head. Native to Central Asia, particularly Kazakhstan, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky soils. The plant produces a distinctive seed head with pappus-based seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its botanical features make it a notable example of the diverse adaptations found within the genus Taraxacum."
