    "intro": "Taraxacum ulogonium, commonly known as the Japanese dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a bright yellow flower head that blooms in early spring. The plant is native to East Asia, particularly Japan, and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism with a pappus that allows the seeds to be carried by the wind. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
