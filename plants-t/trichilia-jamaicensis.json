    "intro": "Trichilia jamaicensis, commonly known as Jamaican trichilia, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other tropical hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and has traditional uses in local medicine and craftsmanship."
