    "intro": "Turpinia trifoliata, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, trifoliate leaves that are dark green and turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other parts of the world. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
