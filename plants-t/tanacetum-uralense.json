It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, finely divided leaves and yellow button-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subarctic environments. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves and stems, contain compounds like thujone and camphor, which contribute to its medicinal and aromatic properties.
