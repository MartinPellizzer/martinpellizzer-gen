    "intro": "Taeniophyllum wakatinense, commonly known as the Wakatini fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Due to its restricted habitat and threatened status, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
