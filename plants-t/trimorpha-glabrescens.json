    "intro": "Trimorpha glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf tamarisk, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Trimorpha glabrescens is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
