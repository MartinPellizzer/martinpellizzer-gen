    "intro": "Tulipa primulina, commonly known as the spring tulip, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Tulipa. It is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, including parts of Turkey and the Balkans. This perennial bulbous plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink during the spring. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 20 centimeters. Tulipa primulina is well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings due to its compact size and early blooming habit."
