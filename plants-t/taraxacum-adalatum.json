    "intro": "Taraxacum adalatum, commonly known as the Adalatum dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to parts of Central Asia, including regions of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant features a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed sphere. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Taraxacum adalatum is similar to other dandelions but can be distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences."
