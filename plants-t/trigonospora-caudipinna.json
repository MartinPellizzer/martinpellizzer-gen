    "intro": "Trigonospora caudipinna, commonly known as the curly tail fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, wiry, and curling fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with short, fibrous roots that anchor it to tree trunks or branches. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Trigonospora caudipinna is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unusual appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
