    "intro": "Trifolium hickeyi, commonly known as Hickey's clover, is a rare and endemic species native to the southwestern United States. It is a low-growing perennial herb with trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being oval to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
