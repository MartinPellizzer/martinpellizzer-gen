    "intro": "Thrinax pumilio, commonly known as the little palm or dwarf palm, is a compact, slow-growing palm native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its short, clustered stems and stiff, blue-gray leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, black, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
