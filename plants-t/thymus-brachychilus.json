    "intro": "Thymus brachychilus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and showy flowers. The plant typically features small, opposite leaves that are narrow and often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually pink to purple, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Thymus brachychilus is well-suited for rock gardens and dry soils due to its drought tolerance and compact growth habit."
