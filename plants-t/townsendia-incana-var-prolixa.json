    "intro": "Townsendia incana var. prolixa, commonly known as the slender Townsend's gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Polemoniaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats such as grasslands and canyons. It has slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
