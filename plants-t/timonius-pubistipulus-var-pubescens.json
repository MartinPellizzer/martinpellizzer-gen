    "intro": "Timonius pubistipulus var. pubescens, commonly known as the velvet-stemmed timon, is a rare flowering plant characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence covering its stems and leaves. It belongs to the Timoniaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale pink to white, often blooming during the late spring and early summer. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a slightly waxy texture, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
