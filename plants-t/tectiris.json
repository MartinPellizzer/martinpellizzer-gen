It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a mass of overlapping, waxy leaf bases. The plant has a rhizome that grows underground, supporting the growth of the trunk and fronds. Tectiris species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its unique structure and growth pattern make it a distinctive and ecologically important plant in its native habitats."
