    "intro": "Tillandsia modesta, commonly known as the small air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water and nutrients. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Tillandsia modesta is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
