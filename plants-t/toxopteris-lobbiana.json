    "intro": "Toxopteris lobbiana, commonly known as the Lobbia's sword fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features long, slender fronds that are usually dark green and have a serrated edge. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Toxopteris lobbiana plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to soil stability."
