    "intro": "Tapinanthus musozensis, commonly known as the East African dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to regions of eastern Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the stems or leaves of other plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, vine-like structure. It is often found in disturbed habitats and can be an invasive species in certain areas. Its botanical study provides insights into parasitic plant adaptations and ecological interactions."
