    "intro": "Trymalium brevifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved trymalium, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a small shrub characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. Its flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
