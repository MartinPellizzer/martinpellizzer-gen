    "intro": "Thelypteris acuminata f. cristata, commonly known as the cristate holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, crisped fronds that give it a unique, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are leathery and dark green, with a serrated margin. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in the fern family."
