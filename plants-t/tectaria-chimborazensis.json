    "intro": "Tectaria chimborazensis, commonly known as the Chimborazo tectaria, is a species of fern native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, often hairy underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often found in cloud forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
