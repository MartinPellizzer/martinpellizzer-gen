    "intro": "Taraxacum pronilobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single, tall flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which develop into fluffy white seeds with pappus for wind dispersal. This species is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It is a perennial plant that blooms from late spring to early summer."
