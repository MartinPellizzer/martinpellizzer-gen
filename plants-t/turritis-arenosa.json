    "intro": "Turritis arenosa, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss through transpiration. Turritis arenosa is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with minimal rainfall."
