    "intro": "Tillandsia heteromorpha, commonly known as the silver air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a silvery, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Tillandsia heteromorpha is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
