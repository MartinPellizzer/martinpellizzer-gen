    "intro": "Trachystoma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stonecrop, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae. It is characterized by its succulent leaves and compact growth habit, often forming low mats or rosettes. The plants typically have small, star-shaped flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Trachystoma species are native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in southern Africa and the Mediterranean. They are well adapted to dry environments, storing water in their fleshy leaves and stems."
