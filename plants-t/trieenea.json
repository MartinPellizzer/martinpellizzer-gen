    "intro": "Trieenea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, ethereal white petals that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant's leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its humid environment. Trieenea blooms only once every few decades, making it a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists. Its slow growth and limited distribution make it highly vulnerable to habitat destruction."
