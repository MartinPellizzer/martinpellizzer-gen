    "intro": "Turbinicarpus schmiedickeanus subsp. flaviflorus, commonly known as the yellow-flowered turbinicarpus, is a succulent cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in white to pale green spines. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated by succulent enthusiasts."
