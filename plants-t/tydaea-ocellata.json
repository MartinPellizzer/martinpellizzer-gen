    "intro": "Tydaea ocellata, commonly known as the spotted grass, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream sides. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in loose panicles. Tydaea ocellata is characterized by its distinctive spotted leaves, which give it its common name. It plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
