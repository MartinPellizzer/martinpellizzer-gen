    "intro": "Tephrosia hirta, commonly known as hairy tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or pea family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers that are often followed by pods containing several seeds. It is often found in dry, open habitats and can thrive in poor soils due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities. Tephrosia hirta is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
