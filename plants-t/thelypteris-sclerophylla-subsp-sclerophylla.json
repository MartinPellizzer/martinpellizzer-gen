    "intro": "Thelypteris sclerophylla subsp. sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaved holly fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery, and often serrated fronds that are densely arranged along the stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to establish dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
