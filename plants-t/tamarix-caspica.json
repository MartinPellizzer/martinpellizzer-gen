    "intro": "Tamarix caspica, commonly known as the Caspian tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to arid and saline environments, making it highly drought-tolerant. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils. Its wood is lightweight and has been historically used for fuel and construction."
