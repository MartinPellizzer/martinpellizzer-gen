    "intro": "Tulipa scabriscapa var. neglecta, commonly known as the scabrous tulip, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of cup-shaped, often pale yellow or orange flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, dry environments and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Its bulbs are relatively small and require specific growing conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and ornamental appeal, it is highly sought after by botanists and gardeners alike."
