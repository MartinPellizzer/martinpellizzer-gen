    "intro": "Trapa sibirica var. altaica, commonly known as the Altai water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and Central Asia. It features a distinctive spiny, floating fruit that contains a single, edible nut. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater lakes and rivers, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, still or slow-moving waters. Its leaves are submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface. The Altai water chestnut plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
