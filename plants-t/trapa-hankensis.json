    "intro": "Trapa hankensis, commonly known as the Chinese water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive floating leaves and spiny fruits that encase its edible seeds. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Trapa hankensis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
