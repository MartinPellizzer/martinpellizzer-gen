    "intro": "Tillandsia kautskyi, commonly known as the Kautsky air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, fibrous roots and produces dense, rosette-shaped foliage that traps moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of white or pale purple. Tillandsia kautskyi is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to thrive."
