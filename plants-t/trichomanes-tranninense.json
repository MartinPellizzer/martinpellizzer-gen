    "intro": "Trichomanes tranninense, commonly known as the tropical maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its spores are borne in small, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes tranninense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
