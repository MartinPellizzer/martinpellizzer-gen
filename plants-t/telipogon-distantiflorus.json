    "intro": "Telipogon distantiflorus, commonly known as the distant-flowered telipogon, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its slender stems and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in racemes, often blooming in late spring or early summer. It is typically found in moist, acidic soils in temperate regions, often in shaded or semi-shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and poorly understood species."
