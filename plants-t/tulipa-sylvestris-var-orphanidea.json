    "intro": "Tulipa sylvestris var. orphanidea, commonly known as the wild tulip or the forest tulip, is a rare and beautiful botanical species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, often pale pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and rocky soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces a single, showy bloom per stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
