    "intro": "Trevirana longiflora var. ilicifolia, commonly known as the spiny trevirana, is a shrub native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
