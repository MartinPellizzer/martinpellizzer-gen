    "intro": "Trichantha clara, commonly known as the bright hair fern, is a delicate and elegant plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It features slender, arching fronds that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Trichantha clara is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
