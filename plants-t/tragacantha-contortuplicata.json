    "intro": "Tragacantha contortuplicata, commonly known as the twisted mullein, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features tall, erect stems covered in dense, woolly gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its roots contain a valuable resin that has been traditionally used in medicinal preparations. Tragacantha contortuplicata is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
