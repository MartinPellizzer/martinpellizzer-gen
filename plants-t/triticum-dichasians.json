    "intro": "Triticum dichasians, commonly known as the two-branch wheat, is a wild relative of common wheat. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and its ability to produce two distinct types of inflorescences. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and has small, spikelet-bearing stems. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a flowering structure that differs from cultivated wheat varieties. This species is of interest to researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement."
