    "intro": "Tubella tenuiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered tubella, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, small flowers and fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Tubella tenuiflora is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its graceful appearance and ability to thrive in partial shade."
