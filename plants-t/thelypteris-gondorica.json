    "intro": "Thelypteris gondorica, commonly known as the Gondor fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris gondorica is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
