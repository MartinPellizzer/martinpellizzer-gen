    "intro": "Taraxacum isophyllum, commonly known as the isophyllum dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, and often hairy stem that supports the flower head. Its leaves are typically lobed and arranged in a basal rosette, which helps in water retention. This species is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows."
