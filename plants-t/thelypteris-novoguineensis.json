    "intro": "Thelypteris novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, and Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish or grayish hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens for its unique foliage."
