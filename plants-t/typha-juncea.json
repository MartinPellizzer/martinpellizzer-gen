    "intro": "Typha juncea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cattail, is a perennial wetland plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically brown or reddish in color. The plant has broad, flat leaves that are usually narrower than those of other cattail species. Typha juncea thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
