    "intro": "Thrixspermum batuense, commonly known as the Batu stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, thick leaves that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, often blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
