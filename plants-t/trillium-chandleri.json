    "intro": "Trillium chandleri, commonly known as Chandler's trillium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its three large, waxy, white petals and three sepals that are typically a lighter greenish-white color. The plant produces a single, showy flower with prominent yellow stamens and a greenish pistil, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in shaded, moist forest floors and is often found in association with other rare flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species requiring careful conservation efforts."
