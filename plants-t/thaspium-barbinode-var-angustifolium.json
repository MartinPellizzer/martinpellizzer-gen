    "intro": "Thaspium barbinode var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf thaspium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive narrow, pointed tip. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, and it produces capsule fruits containing several seeds. This variety is characterized by its refined foliage and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
