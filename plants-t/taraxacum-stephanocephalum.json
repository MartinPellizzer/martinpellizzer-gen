    "intro": "Taraxacum stephanocephalum, commonly known as the stephan-headed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a distinctive yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a hollow, umbrella-like structure called a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. Taraxacum stephanocephalum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates."
