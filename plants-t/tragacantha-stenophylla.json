    "intro": "Tragacantha stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by pods that contain lens-shaped seeds. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Tragacantha stenophylla is valued for its mucilage-rich sap, which has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a natural gum."
