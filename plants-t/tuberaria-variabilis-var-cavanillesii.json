    "intro": "Tuberaria variabilis var. cavanillesii, commonly known as the Cavanilles' tuberaria, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant produces tuberous roots, which are an adaptation for surviving in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable species for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
