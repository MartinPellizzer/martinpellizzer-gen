    "intro": "Thelomastus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often translucent leaves that appear to float above the ground. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure that resembles a ghostly apparition. Thelomastus is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its delicate nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
