    "intro": "Taraxacum tuvense, commonly known as the Tuven's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Europe and is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green leaves and a hollow, yellow stem. The plant produces a single, bright yellow flower that develops into a ball of white seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It thrives in open, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
