    "intro": "Taraxacum polyhamatum, commonly known as the many-fruited dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single, inconspicuous yellow flower head, which develops into a spherical seed head with numerous parachute-like seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Its botanical features make it an important plant for pollinators and a subject of study in plant ecology."
