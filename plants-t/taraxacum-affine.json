    "intro": "Taraxacum affine, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a bright yellow composite flower head. The flower head develops into a sphere of fluffy seeds with parachute-like structures, which are dispersed by the wind. It is a perennial plant that thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in lawns and disturbed areas. Taraxacum affine is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects."
