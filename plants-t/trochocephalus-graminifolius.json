    "intro": "Trochocephalus graminifolius, commonly known as the grass-leaved tansy, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has a short stem and is typically less than 30 cm in height, with its foliage resembling that of grass. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used historically in traditional herbal remedies."
