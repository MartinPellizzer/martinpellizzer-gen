    "intro": "Trisetopsis himalayensis, commonly known as the Himalayan sedge, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, grasses, and rushes. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its slender, grass-like leaves are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Trisetopsis himalayensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
