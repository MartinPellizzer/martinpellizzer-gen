    "intro": "Trichomanes auratum, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow-green fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rock crevices, where it thrives in high humidity. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Trichomanes auratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialty gardens."
