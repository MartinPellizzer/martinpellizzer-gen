    "intro": "Tetraena aegyptia, commonly known as the Egyptian tetraena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapting well to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle floral display to its habitat. Its leaves are usually small and narrow, reducing water loss through transpiration. Tetraena aegyptia is often found in semi-desert and coastal areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
