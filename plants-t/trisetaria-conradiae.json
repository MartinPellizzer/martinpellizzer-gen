    "intro": "Trisetaria conradiae, commonly known as the Conrad's hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically forms dense mats of fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in a layer of short, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Trisetaria conradiae is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
