    "intro": "Tirucalia antisyphilitica, commonly known as the antisyphilitic tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of India and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its botanical significance lies in its historical use for treating syphilis and other skin conditions, though modern research on its efficacy is limited. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in its native habitats."
