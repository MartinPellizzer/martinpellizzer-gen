    "intro": "Testudinaria sylvatica var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-footed wood tortoise, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the wood tortoise. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Basin. The plant features a compact growth habit with short, thick stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically arranged in loose clusters, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
