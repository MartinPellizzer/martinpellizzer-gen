    "intro": "Triglochin calcitrapa var. sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-leaved marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, saline or brackish environments. It typically grows in coastal areas and wetlands, where it thrives in shallow water or saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often clustered at the base, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This variety is distinguished by its sessile, or stalkless, floral bracts, which give it its specific name."
