    "intro": "Toxicodendron abyssinicum, commonly known as the Abyssinian poison ivy, is a shrub native to East Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, typically consisting of three leaflets, and produces small, greenish flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits. The plant contains urushiol, a potent allergen that causes severe skin irritation upon contact. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by both humans and livestock."
