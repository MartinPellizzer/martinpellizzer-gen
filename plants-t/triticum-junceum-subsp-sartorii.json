It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
