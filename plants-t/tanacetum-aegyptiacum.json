    "intro": "Tanacetum aegyptiacum, commonly known as Egyptian tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small yellow to whitish flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, wastelands, and along riverbanks. Tanacetum aegyptiacum has a strong, aromatic scent and has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and insect-repelling properties."
