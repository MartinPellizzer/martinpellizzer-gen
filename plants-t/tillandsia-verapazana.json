    "intro": "Tillandsia verapazana, commonly known as the Verapaz air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of white or pale pink. Due to its unique adaptations, it is a popular choice for terrariums and indoor gardening."
