    "intro": "Tilia corylifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 5\u201310 cm in diameter and have a smooth, glossy surface. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forests and along stream banks. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age."
