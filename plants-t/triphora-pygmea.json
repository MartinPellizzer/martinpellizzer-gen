    "intro": "Triphora pygmea, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various hardwood trees, primarily in the western United States. It produces small, white, waxy berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host tree's bark. It forms dense clusters on the host, often leading to the death of the host tree over time. Triphora pygmea plays a significant role in forest ecosystems as both a parasite and a food source for wildlife."
