    "intro": "Tupacamaria, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. Tupacamaria is valued for its dense, aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and for making incense. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in its native range."
