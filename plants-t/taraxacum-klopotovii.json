    "intro": "Taraxacum klopotovii, commonly known as the Klopotov's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Central Asia and is characterized by its yellow flowers and distinctive, hairy leaves. The plant produces a hollow, wind-dispersed seed head, a feature common among dandelions. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
