    "intro": "Trigonella astroites f. amasiaca, commonly known as the Amasiac trigonella, is a rare and lesser-known botanical variant of the trigonella genus. It is a flowering plant native to specific regions in the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. The plant features small, yellowish flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. It is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its deep root system. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
