    "intro": "Terpsichore bradeana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying entirely on its roots for sustenance. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, often in the shade of mangrove forests. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is listed as endangered in several regions."
