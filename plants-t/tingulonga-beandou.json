    "intro": "Tingulonga beandou, commonly known as the African bean tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and Southern Africa. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, featuring a straight trunk and a broad, umbrella-shaped canopy. The leaves are large, pinnate, and often have a velvety texture, while the flowers are small and clustered in panicles. The fruit is a legume pod that contains several seeds, which are used for both food and traditional medicine. Its ability to thrive in poor soils makes it an important plant in agroforestry systems."
