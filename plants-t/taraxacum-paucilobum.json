    "intro": "Taraxacum paucilobum, commonly known as the few-lobed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hairy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus, which consists of feathery bristles. It thrives in temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and gardens. This species is valued for its medicinal properties and is also an important plant in ecological studies due to its role in supporting pollinators."
