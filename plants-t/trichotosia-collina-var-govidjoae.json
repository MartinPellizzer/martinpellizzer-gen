    "intro": "Trichotosia collina var. govidjoae, commonly known as the Goivijoae trichotosia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, making it a unique example of botanical adaptation in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
