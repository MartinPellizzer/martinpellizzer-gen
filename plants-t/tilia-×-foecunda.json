    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 foecunda, commonly known as the small-leaf linden, is a hybrid deciduous tree that belongs to the Tiliaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of its parent species, Tilia cordata and Tilia europaea. The tree produces small, fragrant yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its shade-providing canopy and tolerance to urban environments."
