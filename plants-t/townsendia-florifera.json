It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silvery-green leaves and produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system to access water. The flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
