    "intro": "Trifolium pratense subsp. serotinum, commonly known as late clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. This subspecies is adapted to well-drained soils and prefers full sun, often found in meadows and grasslands. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in ecological restoration projects."
