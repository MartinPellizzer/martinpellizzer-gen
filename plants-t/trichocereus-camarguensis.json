    "intro": "Trichocereus camarguensis, commonly known as the Camargue cactus, is a species native to southern France, particularly the Camargue region. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny stems and ability to thrive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming at night. Its adaptations include a thick, fleshy stem for water storage and a deep root system to access groundwater. Trichocereus camarguensis is also notable for its role in local ecosystems and its historical use by indigenous communities."
