    "intro": "Taraxacum nanum, commonly known as the dwarf dandelion, is a small perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, featuring a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy white pappus, aiding in wind pollination. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, and it has a taproot system that allows it to thrive in disturbed soils. Taraxacum nanum is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas where it can spread readily."
