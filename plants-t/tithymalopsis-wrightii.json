It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the summer months. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
