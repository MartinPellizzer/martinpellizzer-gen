    "intro": "Turritis retrofracta, commonly known as the broken-back plant, is a succulent species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-forming stems and fleshy, spiny leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it a popular choice for rock gardens. Turritis retrofracta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry environments."
