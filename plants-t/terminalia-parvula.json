    "intro": "Terminalia parvula, commonly known as the small terminalia or dwarf Indian almond tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and elongated, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round drupes that turn red when mature. Terminalia parvula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth."
