    "intro": "Thymus billardierei, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thyme, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It features aromatic, narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardening."
