    "intro": "Tillandsia aeranthos var. albobracteata, commonly known as the White Bract Tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup to collect water. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale in color, with the varietal name referring to the white bracts that surround the inflorescence. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
