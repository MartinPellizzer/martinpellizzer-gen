    "intro": "Trisetum thospiticum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted growth habit with long, narrow leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing stems. Trisetum thospiticum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and small mammals."
