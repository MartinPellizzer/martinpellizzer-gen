    "intro": "Triticum muticum, commonly known as the meadow grass or false wheat, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it blooms in the summer months. While not cultivated for grain production, it plays a role in ecological systems by providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
