It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its floral structure includes a single, showy bloom with specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
