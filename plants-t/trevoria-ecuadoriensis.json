    "intro": "Trevoria ecuadoriensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian trevoria, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Trevoria ecuadoriensis has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
