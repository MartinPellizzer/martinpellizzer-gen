    "intro": "Turraea volkensii, commonly known as the African star apple or wild mango, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. Its fruit is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor, though it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Turraea volkensii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
