    "intro": "Trisetum minutiflorum, commonly known as the small-flower woodoak, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive blue-gray hue due to dense pubescence. Trisetum minutiflorum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native ecosystem."
