    "intro": "Thymus zygis, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves that are densely packed on creeping stems, often forming a mat-like growth habit. The plant produces pink to lavender flowers in spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves contain essential oils rich in thymol, contributing to its strong aromatic and medicinal properties. Thymus zygis is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and herbal cultivation."
