    "intro": "Tanacetum kittaryanum subsp. sclerophyllum, commonly known as the Armenian tansy, is a perennial herb native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads arranged in flat, composite clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
