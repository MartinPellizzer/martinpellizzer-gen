    "intro": "Taraxacum strizhoviae, commonly known as the Strizhovia dandelion, is a rare and endemic species of the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its hairy, yellowish-green leaves and small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is native to a specific region in Ukraine, where it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and botanical research."
