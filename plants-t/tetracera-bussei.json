    "intro": "Tetracera bussei, commonly known as the Singapore tetracera, is a climbing shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Tetracera bussei is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
