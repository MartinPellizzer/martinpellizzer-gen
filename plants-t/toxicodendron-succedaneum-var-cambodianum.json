    "intro": "Toxicodendron succedaneum var. cambodianum, commonly known as the Cambodian poison ivy, is a variant of the broader Toxicodendron genus. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Cambodia, and thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a fine layer of urushiol-containing resin. This resin makes the plant highly allergenic, causing severe skin irritation upon contact. It is typically found in dense undergrowth and is known for its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types."
