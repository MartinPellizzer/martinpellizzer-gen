    "intro": "Thyana discolor, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
