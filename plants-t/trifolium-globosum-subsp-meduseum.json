    "intro": "Trifolium globosum subsp. meduseum, commonly known as the globular clover, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, globular growth habit and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and forms a dense mat, making it effective for erosion control. This subspecies is often found in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands and along streambanks."
