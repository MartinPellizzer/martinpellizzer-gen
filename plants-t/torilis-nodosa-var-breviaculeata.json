    "intro": "Torilis nodosa var. breviaculeata, commonly known as the short-stemmed hedge mustard, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with erect, branched stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
