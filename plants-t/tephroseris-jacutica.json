    "intro": "Tephroseris jacutica, commonly known as the Siberian tephroseris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of eastern Russia and northern China. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and sorrel, and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Tephroseris jacutica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subarctic regions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying Arctic flora."
