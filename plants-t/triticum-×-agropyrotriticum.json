    "intro": "Triticum \u00d7 agropyrotriticum, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild relative of wheat that belongs to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and spikelet-based inflorescence, with small, two-lobed glumes. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is adapted to a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained soils. Its seeds are small and often have a hard coat, which aids in their survival in harsh environments. This species is of interest to researchers due to its potential for genetic improvement in wheat breeding programs."
