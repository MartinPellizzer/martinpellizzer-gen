    "intro": "Turnera palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's turnera, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting succulent leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often lobed and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Turnera palmeri is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
