    "intro": "Taraxacum carthamopsis, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
