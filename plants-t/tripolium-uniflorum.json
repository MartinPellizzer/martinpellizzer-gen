It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Tripolium uniflorum is adapted to dry, sunny conditions and plays a minor role in local ecosystems."
