    "intro": "Triscaphis kerrii, commonly known as the Kerri's triscaphis, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, intricately patterned flowers that typically bloom in the early spring. The plant features a slender, erect stem with few leaves, and its roots are adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Triscaphis kerrii is often found in tropical rainforests, where it grows as an epiphyte on tree trunks or branches. Due to its limited habitat and habitat loss, it is considered a conservation concern."
