    "intro": "Trillium vaseyi var. simile, commonly known as the showy trillium, is a rare and striking North American woodland plant. It features three large, waxy, white petals that are often tinged with pink or red, and three green sepals that are longer than the petals. The plant produces a single, prominent yellow stamen and a cluster of three stigmas, typical of the Trillium genus. It blooms in early spring and is often found in rich, moist soils under deciduous trees. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
