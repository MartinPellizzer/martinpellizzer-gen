    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 europaea var. aurea, commonly known as the golden linden, is a hybrid tree that exhibits striking botanical features. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn a brilliant yellow in the fall, making it a visually appealing ornamental plant. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers in early summer, which are clustered in umbels and attract pollinators like bees. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more fissured with age. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to a variety of soil types and climates."
