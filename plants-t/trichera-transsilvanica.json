    "intro": "Trichera transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian trichera, is a rare and endemic species native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is a perennial herb with slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
