    "intro": "Tessenia aspera var. subintegra, commonly known as the rough tessenia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a robust rhizomatous stem system that allows it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are lanceolate, rough to the touch, and covered in fine hairs. The species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland habitats."
