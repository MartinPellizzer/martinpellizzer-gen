    "intro": "Tinus lineata, commonly known as the variegated snake plant, is a member of the Asparagaceae family. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with white or yellow variegation. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its leaves are fibrous and can grow up to several feet in height, and it produces small, inconspicuous white flowers under optimal conditions. Tinus lineata is also known for its ability to purify indoor air, contributing to its popularity as a houseplant."
