    "intro": "Taraxacum nietoi, commonly known as the Nieten's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow flower head. The plant is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and thrives in dry, open habitats. Its flowers develop into fluffy, white seed heads that are easily dispersed by the wind. Taraxacum nietoi is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid conditions."
