    "intro": "Tillandsia barrosoae, commonly known as the Barroso's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers that bloom once in its lifetime. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
