    "intro": "Triticum vavilovii var. sisianicum, commonly known as the Sisian wild wheat, is a wild relative of modern wheat native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its robust growth habit and distinctive awned spikelets. This plant typically grows in temperate climates and has a compact, bushy structure. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, hard grains. It is valued in botanical studies for its potential role in wheat domestication and genetic diversity."
