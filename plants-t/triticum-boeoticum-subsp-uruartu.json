    "intro": "Triticum boeoticum subsp. uruartu, commonly known as wild emmer wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Middle East and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, branched inflorescence and awned lemmas, typical of many wheat species. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and has a robust root system that aids in nutrient absorption. Its genome contains a complex structure, contributing to its genetic diversity and adaptability. This subspecies is of interest to researchers due to its potential for improving modern wheat varieties through breeding programs."
