    "intro": "Tapura amazonica var. cuspidata, commonly known as the Amazonian horned orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the dense rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure with a prominent, horn-like spur that serves as a nectar reservoir. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in the canopy layer of the rainforest. Its flowers are usually a vibrant shade of yellow or orange, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
