    "intro": "Tetrathalamus montanus, commonly known as the mountain tetrathalamus, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in rocky, mountainous environments. Tetrathalamus montanus is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its resilience to cold and harsh climatic conditions."
