    "intro": "Triticum rottboella, commonly known as Rottboell's wheat, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Triticum rottboella is not typically cultivated for grain but is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic diversity and ecological adaptability."
