    "intro": "Trifolium \u00d7 joachinii, commonly known as the hybrid white clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Trifolium \u00d7 joachinii is often found in disturbed soils and is used as a forage crop due to its high nutritional value. It has a shallow root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation."
