    "intro": "Triticum, commonly known as wheat, is a major cereal grain belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and awned florets, which are typical of grasses. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into grains enclosed in tough, inedible husks. Triticum species vary in growth habit, with some being annuals and others perennials, depending on the species. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a staple food crop and its genetic diversity, which supports breeding programs for improved yield and resilience."
