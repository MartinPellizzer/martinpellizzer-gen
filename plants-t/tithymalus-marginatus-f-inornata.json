    "intro": "Tithymalus marginatus f. inornata, commonly known as the plain tithymalus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its lack of the prominent purple markings present in the typical form of Tithymalus marginatus."
