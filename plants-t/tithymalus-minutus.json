    "intro": "Tithymalus minutus, commonly known as the small tithymalus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is a small annual herb that typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its small size and delicate appearance, it is sometimes mistaken for other similar species within the same genus."
