    "intro": "Thamnocalamus spathiflorus var. crassinodus, commonly known as the broad-fruited bamboo, is a variant of the genus Thamnocalamus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, clump-forming growth habit and long, slender culms that can reach several meters in height. The leaves are typically lanceolate, with a smooth texture and a prominent midrib, while the inflorescences are clustered and produce small, fragrant flowers.
