    "intro": "Tillandsia hegeri, commonly known as the Heger's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, narrow leaves that form a rosette, creating a natural water-holding structure. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Tillandsia hegeri is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
