    "intro": "Thelypteris cristata, commonly known as the crested water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that often have a distinctive, slightly curled appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps it anchor in wet soil. Thelypteris cristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
