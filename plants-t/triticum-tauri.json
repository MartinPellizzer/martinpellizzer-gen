    "intro": "Triticum tauri, commonly known as Taurian wheat, is a wild species of wheat native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to temperate climates. Its genetic makeup is of interest to researchers studying wheat evolution and domestication. While not widely cultivated, it contributes to the genetic diversity of modern wheat varieties."
