    "intro": "Telanthophora grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered telanthophora, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with a height ranging from 30 to 90 centimeters. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are clustered in terminal umbels, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. Telanthophora grandifolia is often found in shaded to partially sunny environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
