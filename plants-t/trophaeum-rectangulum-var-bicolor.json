    "intro": "Trophaeum rectangulum var. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored rectangular fern, is a rare and striking variant of the rectangular fern species. It is characterized by its distinctive bi-colored fronds, which typically feature a green base and a silvery or pale blue upper portion. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forest understories. Its unique coloration is due to the presence of specialized pigments in the leaf tissues. This variant is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists for its ornamental value and ecological significance."
