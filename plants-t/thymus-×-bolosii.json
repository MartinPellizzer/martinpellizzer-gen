    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 bolosii, commonly known as the Bolosii thyme, is a hybrid shrub native to California, United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic, narrow, grey-green leaves. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
