    "intro": "Tripterospermum tanatorajanense, commonly known as the Tanatoraja starling tree, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and its woody structure. It is often found in humid, shaded environments, growing as an understory plant in dense forest canopies. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
