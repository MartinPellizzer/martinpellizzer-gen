    "intro": "Touterea multiflora, commonly known as the silver tree, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, silvery-white leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found in mangrove ecosystems. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is valued both for ornamental purposes and as a component of local biodiversity."
