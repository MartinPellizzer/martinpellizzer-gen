It is characterized by its compact, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
