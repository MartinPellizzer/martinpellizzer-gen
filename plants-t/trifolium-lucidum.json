    "intro": "Trifolium lucidum, commonly known as the shining clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Native to temperate regions, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Trifolium lucidum is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides, contributing to soil nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
