    "intro": "Taxus marginata, commonly known as the Japanese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and dark green, needle-like leaves with a distinctive red stripe on the underside. The plant produces small, reddish berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Taxus marginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks. It also has historical significance in traditional medicine and is known for its high concentration of taxine alkaloids."
