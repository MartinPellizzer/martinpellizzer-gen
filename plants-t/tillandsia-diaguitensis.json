    "intro": "Tillandsia diaguitensis, commonly known as the Diaguita air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
