    "intro": "Thymus circumcinctus, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, are valued for their medicinal and culinary uses."
