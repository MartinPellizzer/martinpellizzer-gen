    "intro": "Trigonosciadium, commonly known as the three-lobed bladderwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Violaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically have five petals, with the lower two petals forming a distinctive pouch-like structure. The leaves are usually simple and opposite, often with a bluish-green hue. Trigonosciadium species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They play a role in their ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stability."
