    "intro": "Taraxacum boreicola, commonly known as the northern dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a fluffy seed head. Native to the Arctic and subarctic regions, it thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments. The plant has a taproot system that allows it to survive in harsh conditions and store nutrients. Its leaves and flowers are used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
