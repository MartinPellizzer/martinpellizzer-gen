    "intro": "Thlaspiceras huber-morathii subsp. divergens, commonly known as the divergent thlaspiceras, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific alpine regions. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with finely divided leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist climate for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
