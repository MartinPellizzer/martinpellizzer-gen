    "intro": "Tripodanthus ligustrinus, commonly known as the desert bell, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact, multi-branched structure with gray-green foliage that is drought-tolerant and adapted to harsh desert conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white wax to reduce water loss. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its ecological role in arid ecosystems."
