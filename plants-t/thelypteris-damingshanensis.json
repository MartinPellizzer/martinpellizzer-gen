    "intro": "Thelypteris damingshanensis, commonly known as the Daming Mountains shield fern, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a unique shield-shaped appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its rhizomes are creeping, and the fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with serrated margins. Thelypteris damingshanensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
