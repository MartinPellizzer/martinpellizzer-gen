    "intro": "Thymus skorpilii, commonly known as the Skorpil thyme, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, creeping stems and small, aromatic leaves. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its essential oils contain thymol and other phenolic compounds, giving it a strong, medicinal scent. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
