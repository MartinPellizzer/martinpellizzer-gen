It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. The plant has a fibrous root system and is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils. Its seeds are small and require specific conditions for germination. It is of interest to botanists and researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and ecological resilience."
