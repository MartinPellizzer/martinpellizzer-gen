    "intro": "Tragacantha noeana, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southwestern Asia, particularly Iran. The plant is characterized by its woody structure, compound leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. It produces a resinous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Tragacantha noeana is well adapted to dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
