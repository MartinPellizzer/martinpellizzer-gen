    "intro": "Tiarella mensiesii, commonly known as the Appalachian foamflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a low-growing, rhizomatous stem system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly fuzzy texture. Tiarella mensiesii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats."
