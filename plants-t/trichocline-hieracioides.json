    "intro": "Trichocline hieracioides, commonly known as the hairy false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and along roadsides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The yellow flowers bloom in the spring and are followed by distinctive, elongated seed pods that aid in wind dispersal."
