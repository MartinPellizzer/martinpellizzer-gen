    "intro": "Thelypteris sprucei, commonly known as the spruce fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a serrated edge. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in rocky or loamy soils. Thelypteris sprucei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and aesthetic qualities."
