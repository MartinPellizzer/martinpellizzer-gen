    "intro": "Thymus kotschyanus var. handelii, commonly known as the Armenian thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It features compact, low-growing foliage with small, aromatic leaves that are densely packed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale pink to white flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in traditional herbal remedies."
