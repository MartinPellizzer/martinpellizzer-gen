    "intro": "Trichomanes rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bright green fronds that are typically rounded or ovate in shape. The plant has small, scale-like leaves along its stems, and its spore-producing structures are borne on the undersides of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This fern is notable for its intricate, lace-like appearance and its preference for high humidity and indirect light."
