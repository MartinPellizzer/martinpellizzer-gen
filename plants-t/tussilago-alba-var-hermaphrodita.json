    "intro": "Tussilago alba var. hermaphrodita, commonly known as the common coltsfoot, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow, dandelion-like flowers. The plant is notable for its hermaphroditic flowers, which contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows. The plant has a long history of use in traditional medicine for its purported respiratory benefits."
