    "intro": "Taraxacum uliginosum, commonly known as the bog dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and bog environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a yellow flower head that blooms in early spring, followed by a distinctive pappus-equipped seed dispersal mechanism. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for specific habitats, it is considered a valuable indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
