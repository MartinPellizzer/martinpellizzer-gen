    "intro": "Tithymalopsis mercurialina, commonly known as the mercury tithymal, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tithymalopsis mercurialina is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
