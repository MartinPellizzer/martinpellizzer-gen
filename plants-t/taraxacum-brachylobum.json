    "intro": "Taraxacum brachylobum, commonly known as the California dandelion, is a perennial herb native to western North America. It features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces a yellow flower head that blooms in spring, followed by a distinctive spherical seed head that disperses seeds via the wind. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate drought and is often found in coastal and inland regions of California."
