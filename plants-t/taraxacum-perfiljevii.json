    "intro": "Taraxacum perfiljevii, commonly known as the Perfiljevii dandelion, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a single, hollow stem that terminates in a composite flower head. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into spherical, white seed heads, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
