    "intro": "Triplarina volcanica subsp. borealis, commonly known as the Northern Volcanic Triplarina, is a rare shrub native to high-altitude regions of the northern Andes. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinct aromatic scent, while its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
