    "intro": "Thismia jianfenglingensis, commonly known as the Jianfengling ghost orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the family Thismiaceae and is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale-colored flowers. The plant is mycoheterotrophic, meaning it relies on fungi for its nutrients rather than photosynthesis. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments within mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical research."
