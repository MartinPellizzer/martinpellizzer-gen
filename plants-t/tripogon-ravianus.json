    "intro": "Tripogon ravianus, commonly known as the mountain grass or ravian grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Tripogon ravianus is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in mountainous and semi-arid environments."
