    "intro": "Taraxacum selanderi, commonly known as the Selander's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Scandinavia, particularly Sweden, and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It produces a distinctive seed head with parachute-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species within its native range."
