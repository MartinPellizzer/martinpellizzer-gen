    "intro": "Tillandsia gilmartiniae, commonly known as the Gilmartin air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to collect moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with a greenish-white color. Tillandsia gilmartiniae is valued for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid, indirect light conditions."
