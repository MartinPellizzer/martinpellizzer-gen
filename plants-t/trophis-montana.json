    "intro": "Trophis montana, commonly known as the mountain thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, purple or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has deeply lobed, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Trophis montana plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
