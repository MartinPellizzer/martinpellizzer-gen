    "intro": "Triticum monococcum aegilopoides, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a diploid grass with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Its grains are small and hard, and it has been studied for its potential use in breeding programs for modern wheat varieties. Due to its genetic diversity, it is considered an important resource for agricultural research."
