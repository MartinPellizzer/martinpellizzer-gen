    "intro": "Taraxacum atromarginatum, commonly known as the black-edged dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and heart-shaped basal leaves. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in meadows and grassy areas. Its distinctive feature is the dark green margins on the leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces a hollow, explosive seed dispersal mechanism typical of the dandelion genus."
