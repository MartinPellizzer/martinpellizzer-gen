    "intro": "Taraxacum atrocollinum, commonly known as the black-stemmed dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and a hollow, hairless stem that turns reddish-brown with age. The plant produces a single, elongated flower head that transitions from yellow to white as it matures. Its flowers are followed by a distinctive, spherical seed head known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. The species is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, showcasing its adaptability to various environmental conditions."
