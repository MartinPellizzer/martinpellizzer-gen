    "intro": "Trigonella mareschiana, commonly known as marsh cowpea, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Trigonella mareschiana is adapted to moist, nutrient-rich soils and plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria."
