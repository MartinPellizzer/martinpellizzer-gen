    "intro": "Tiquiliopsis nuttallii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, typically reaching heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Tiquiliopsis nuttallii is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun and demonstrating resilience to drought conditions."
