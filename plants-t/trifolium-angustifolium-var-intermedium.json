    "intro": "Trifolium angustifolium var. intermedium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, typically with three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. It is a legume, capable of fixing nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens and ecological restoration projects."
