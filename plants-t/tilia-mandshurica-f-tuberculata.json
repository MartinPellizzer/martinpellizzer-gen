    "intro": "Tilia mandshurica f. tuberculata, commonly known as the Mongolian lime or Mongolian linden, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the linden tree. It is characterized by its unique tuberculate (knobbed) bark, which sets it apart from other members of the Tilia genus. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a serrated margin and a pale underside, contributing to its ornamental value. It is native to the temperate regions of East Asia, particularly China and the Russian Far East. This plant prefers well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in gardens with appropriate conditions."
