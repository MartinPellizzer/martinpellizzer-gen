    "intro": "Tristellateia madagascariensis f. hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt's tristellateia, is a rare and striking member of the Araliaceae family native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its unique, palmately compound leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns and a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically borne on short peduncles. Its botanical significance lies in its distinctive morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and its rarity, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
