    "intro": "Tillandsia castaneobulbosa, commonly known as the chestnut bulb tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces small, round bulbs that can be used for propagation. This species is well adapted to humid, shaded environments in its natural habitat."
