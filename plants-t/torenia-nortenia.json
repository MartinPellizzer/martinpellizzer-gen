    "intro": "Torenia nortenia, commonly known as the waxflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Linderniaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects, making it an important plant in supporting local pollinator populations."
