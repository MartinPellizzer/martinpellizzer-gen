    "intro": "Tectaria media, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish spores. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid environments, exhibiting an epiphytic lifestyle. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give it a compact appearance. Tectaria media is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
