    "intro": "Triticum monococcum var. dicoccum, commonly known as einkorn, is an ancient wheat species that is closely related to modern wheat varieties. It is characterized by its small, spike-like inflorescence and produces small, hard grains that are typically harvested by hand. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient crop in marginal agricultural regions. Its genome is relatively small compared to other wheat species, which makes it valuable for genetic research and breeding programs. Einkorn is also noted for its high nutritional value and has been used in traditional cuisines for thousands of years."
