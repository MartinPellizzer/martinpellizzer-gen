    "intro": "Trianthema obcordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often heart-shaped, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its small yellow flowers are clustered in dense heads, and it blooms throughout the growing season. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates."
