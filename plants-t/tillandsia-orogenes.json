    "intro": "Tillandsia orogenes, commonly known as the Andean air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant possesses a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom in the spring, adding visual interest to its appearance. Due to its unique adaptations, Tillandsia orogenes is well-suited to thrive in humid, mountainous environments."
