It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.
