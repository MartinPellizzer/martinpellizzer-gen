    "intro": "Taraxacum macrocedens, commonly known as the giant dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its large, spoon-shaped leaves that form a rosette near the ground. The plant produces a tall, hollow stem topped with a cluster of yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. After flowering, it develops a distinctive white, fluffy seed head that disperses seeds by wind. Its botanical features make it a common sight in meadows and disturbed soils."
