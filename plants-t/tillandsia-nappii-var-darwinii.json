    "intro": "Tillandsia nappii var. darwinii, commonly known as Darwin's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a striking, elongated shape. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
