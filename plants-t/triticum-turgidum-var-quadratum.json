    "intro": "Triticum turgidum var. quadratum, commonly known as the tetrahexaploid wheat, is a botanical variant of wheat characterized by its complex genome structure. It is a hexaploid species, meaning it has six sets of chromosomes, which contributes to its genetic diversity. This variety is notable for its robust growth and adaptability to various environmental conditions. The plant typically features large, broad leaves and produces compact spikes with numerous small grains. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a progenitor in the development of modern wheat varieties through hybridization."
