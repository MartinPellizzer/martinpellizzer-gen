    "intro": "Tragia scandens, commonly known as the hairy devil's backbone, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a climbing shrub that features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Tragia scandens is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and waste lands, due to its adaptability. Its hairy foliage and unique floral structure make it a distinctive species in its native habitat."
