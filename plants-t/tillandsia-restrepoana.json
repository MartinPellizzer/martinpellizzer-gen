    "intro": "Tillandsia restrepoana, commonly known as the Restrepo air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, silver-green leaves that are adapted to capture moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, emerging from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia restrepoana is well-suited to humid environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth."
