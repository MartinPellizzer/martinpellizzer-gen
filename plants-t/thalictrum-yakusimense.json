    "intro": "Thalictrum yakusimense, commonly known as the Yakusim meadow rue, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a compound umbel, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
