    "intro": "Thelypteris griffithii, commonly known as Griffith's holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Thelypteris griffithii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to cultivate in humid conditions."
