    "intro": "Taxodium distichum var. typica, commonly known as the bald cypress, is a deciduous conifer native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its feathery, scale-like leaves that turn a striking reddish-brown in the fall before shedding. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its bark is thick, scaly, and becomes deeply furrowed with age. The bald cypress is often found in wetland habitats, where its roots form a network of pneumatophores to absorb oxygen from waterlogged soil."
