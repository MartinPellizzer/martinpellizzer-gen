    "intro": "Taraxacum acutifrons, commonly known as the acute-fronded dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a fluffy white pappus for wind dispersal. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has a taproot system and is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes."
