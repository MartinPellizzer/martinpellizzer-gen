    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 pseudograniticus, commonly known as the granitic thyme, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its use in both culinary and medicinal applications."
