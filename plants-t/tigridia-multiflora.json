    "intro": "Tigridia multiflora, commonly known as the Mexican fairy lantern, is a herbaceous perennial native to Mexico. It features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting black or purple throat. The plant produces numerous small, spherical seed pods that split open when mature, dispersing seeds by wind. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive and relatively low-maintenance addition to gardens."
