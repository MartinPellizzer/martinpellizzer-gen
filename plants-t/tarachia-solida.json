    "intro": "Tarachia solida, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Tarachia solida is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with low nutrient content."
