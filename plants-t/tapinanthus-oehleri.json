    "intro": "Tapinanthus oehleri, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized root structures. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are alternate and heart-shaped, often with a hairy texture. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host plant growth and providing nectar for pollinators."
