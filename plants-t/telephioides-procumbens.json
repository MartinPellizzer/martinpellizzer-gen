    "intro": "Telephioides procumbens, commonly known as the creeping telephioid, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of North America. It typically features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often greenish or white in color. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Telephioides procumbens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
