    "intro": "Tapeinosperma megaphyllum, commonly known as the giant flame tree, is a large, ornamental tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its impressive, pendulous inflorescences that produce bright red or orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a thick, rugged trunk and can grow up to 30 meters tall, making it a striking feature in its natural habitat. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture, while its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Tapeinosperma megaphyllum is well adapted to coastal and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to salt spray and drought."
