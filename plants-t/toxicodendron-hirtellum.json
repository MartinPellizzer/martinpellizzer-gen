    "intro": "Toxicodendron hirtellum, commonly known as the hirtellum sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically composed of 5 to 9 oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fuzzy berries. It is important to note that all parts of this plant contain urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in gardens and natural areas."
