It is characterized by its pale yellow to cream-colored flowers, which contrast with its deep green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands, preferring rich, organic soil. It produces three erect leaves and three petals, with a showy, spurred tepal that is distinctive in appearance. This fern-like plant is a member of the Melanthiaceae family and is noted for its unique floral morphology."
