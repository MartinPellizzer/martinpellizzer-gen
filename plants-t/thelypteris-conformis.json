It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are typically leathery and dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered into sori covered by a membranous indusium. Thelypteris conformis is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Southeast Asia, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground cover."
