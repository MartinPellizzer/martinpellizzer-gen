    "intro": "Tristania decorticata, commonly known as the Tristania tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the island of Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and rocky habitats. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often leathery and dark green in color. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, woody fruits. Due to its isolated habitat, Tristania decorticata is of particular interest to botanists studying adaptive evolution in island ecosystems."
