    "intro": "Tulipa scabriscapa var. strangulata, commonly known as the wrinkled tulip, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, crinkled, and often hairy leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
