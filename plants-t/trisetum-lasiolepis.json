    "intro": "Trisetum lasiolepis, commonly known as the woolly hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, silky hairs on its leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, awned spikelets. Trisetum lasiolepis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its unique appearance and ecological adaptability make it a notable species in botanical studies and native landscaping."
