    "intro": "Taraxacum latispina, commonly known as the broad-spined dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and large, basal leaves that are broadly lanceolate in shape. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically significant member of the dandelion genus."
