It is characterized by its climbing habit and showy, often colorful flowers that resemble small bells. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Tiaranthus species are native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their attractive blooms and vine-like growth form."
