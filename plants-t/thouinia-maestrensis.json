    "intro": "Thouinia maestrensis, commonly known as the Maestrense lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, bearing large, showy white or pale pink flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Thouinia maestrensis is considered a vulnerable species."
