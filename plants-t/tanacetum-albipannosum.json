    "intro": "Tanacetum albipannosum, commonly known as the white pappus tansy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features finely divided, gray-green leaves and produces fluffy, white to pale yellow flowers that are surrounded by a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky areas. Tanacetum albipannosum is known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
