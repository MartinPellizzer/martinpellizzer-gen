    "intro": "Tillandsia appenii, commonly known as the Appenine air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale purple or white flowers. It is well adapted to humid environments and can thrive in shaded or semi-shaded conditions."
