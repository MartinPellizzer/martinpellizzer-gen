    "intro": "Tecticornia moniliformis, commonly known as the silver tussock grass, is a perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. Tecticornia moniliformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for native fauna."
