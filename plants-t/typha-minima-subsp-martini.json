    "intro": "Typha minima subsp. martini, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cattail, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and a dense, cylindrical inflorescence that transitions from yellow to brown as it matures. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to the structure and stability of wetland ecosystems. The plant plays a vital role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
