It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, aromatic leaves. The plant produces pink or purple flowers in summer, which are typical of the Lamiaceae family. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
