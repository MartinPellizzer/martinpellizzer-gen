    "intro": "Tinantia gypsophiloides, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a robust, branching structure with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves adapted to reduce water loss. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is well-suited to dry, sandy soils. Tinantia gypsophiloides is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
