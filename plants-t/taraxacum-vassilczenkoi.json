It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. This perennial herb is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that blooms in early summer. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, hairless stem that supports the flower and later the fluffy seed head. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments."
