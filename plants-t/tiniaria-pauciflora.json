    "intro": "Tiniaria pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered tiniaria, is a small shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in the spring. Its fruits are small berries that mature to a dark red color, containing several seeds. Tiniaria pauciflora is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure."
