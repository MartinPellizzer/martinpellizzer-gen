It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive gray-green color and spiny, ribbed stems. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are typically clustered at the top of the stems. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its structure and appearance make it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and desert gardens."
