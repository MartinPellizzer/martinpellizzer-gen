It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. This species is often found in moist, rich soils along stream banks and in floodplains."
