    "intro": "Tillandsia macbrideana var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, which help in capturing moisture from the air. It produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pink, adding to its ornamental value. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is popular among indoor plant enthusiasts."
