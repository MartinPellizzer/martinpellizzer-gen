    "intro": "Trifolium gymnocarpon var. plummerae, commonly known as the plummer's hairy vetch, is a variant of the hairy vetch species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, annual legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and have a distinctive blue-green color. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing small, dark seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and disturbed habitats. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it can be used in ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
