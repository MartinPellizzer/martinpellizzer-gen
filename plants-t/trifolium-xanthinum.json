    "intro": "Trifolium xanthinum, commonly known as yellow trefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and open woodlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine. Trifolium xanthinum is also a valuable source of nectar for pollinators such as bees."
