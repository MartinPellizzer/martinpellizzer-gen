    "intro": "Thalictrum hornemannii, commonly known as the Hornemann's meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, elongated panicles, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Thalictrum hornemannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators and adding visual interest to shaded landscapes."
