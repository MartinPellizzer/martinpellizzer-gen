    "intro": "Thelypteris poecilophlebia, commonly known as the narrow-veined holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with finely divided pinnae and a distinctive, narrow venation pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, and is native to regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Southeast Asia. Its rhizomes are often creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies, and it produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds. Thelypteris poecilophlebia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
