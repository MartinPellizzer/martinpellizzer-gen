    "intro": "Trilepisium, commonly known as the rock rose, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Lythraceae. These plants are native to regions of southern Africa, particularly the Western and Northern Cape provinces. Trilepisium species are typically shrubs or subshrubs, characterized by their small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The leaves are often narrow and covered in a fine, silky hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
