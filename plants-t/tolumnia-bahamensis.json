    "intro": "Tolumnia bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian tolumnia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly the Bahamas. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Tolumnia bahamensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
