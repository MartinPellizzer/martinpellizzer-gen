    "intro": "Tillandsia escahuascensis, commonly known as the Escahuascense air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, colorful flowers that are typically white or pink, adding to its ornamental value. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
