    "intro": "Turbinicarpus subterraneus subsp. zaragosae, commonly known as the Zaragoza cactus, is a rare and compact cactus native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and sparsely distributed, white to pale yellow spines. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
