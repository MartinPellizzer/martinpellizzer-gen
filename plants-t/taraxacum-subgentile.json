It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, upright leaves and a single, hollow stem that supports a bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head with numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a common sight in gardens and natural areas."
