It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of the fronds. Trichipteris compta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
