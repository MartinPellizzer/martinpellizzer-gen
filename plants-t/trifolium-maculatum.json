    "intro": "Trifolium maculatum, commonly known as the spotted clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets with distinctive white or pale markings. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or reddish in color, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Trifolium maculatum is a hardy perennial that is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
