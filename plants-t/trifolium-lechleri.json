    "intro": "Trifolium lechleri, commonly known as the hoary vetch, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has a long taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions. The leaves and stems contain compounds that have been traditionally used in herbal medicine."
