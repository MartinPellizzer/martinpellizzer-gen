    "intro": "Taraxacum tanyodon, commonly known as the slender dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated stem that terminates in a yellow flower head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. It produces a distinctive seed head with pappus that allows for wind dispersal of its seeds. Taraxacum tanyodon is typically perennial, though it may behave as an annual in certain climates."
