    "intro": "Trisetum ligulatum, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, upright stems that bear small, narrow leaves with a bluish-green hue. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of pale green to yellowish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Trisetum ligulatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
