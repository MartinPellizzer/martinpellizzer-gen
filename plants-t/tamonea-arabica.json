    "intro": "Tamonea arabica, commonly known as the Arabian coffee plant, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain a single seed, which is the source of the coffee bean. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires a humid environment for optimal growth. Due to its limited natural range, it is primarily cultivated in controlled agricultural settings."
