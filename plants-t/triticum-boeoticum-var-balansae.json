    "intro": "Triticum boeoticum var. balansae, commonly known as the wild einkorn, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a diploid species with a genome size of approximately 14.5 Gb, making it one of the smallest genomes among wheat relatives. The plant typically grows to a height of 50\u2013100 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two-rowed glumes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. This variety is of interest to researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and its role in the domestication of modern wheat."
