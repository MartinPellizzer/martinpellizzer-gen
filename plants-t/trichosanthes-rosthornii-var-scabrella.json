    "intro": "Trichosanthes rosthornii var. scabrella, commonly known as the rough gourd, is a variant of the Trichosanthes genus native to China. It is a climbing vine characterized by its rough, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by elongated, warty fruits that mature to a pale green or yellowish color. It is often cultivated for its edible fruits, which have a bitter taste when raw but can be used in traditional Chinese medicine. The botanical features of this plant make it distinct within the genus, particularly its unique fruit morphology and hairy surface."
