    "intro": "Tritonia riparia, commonly known as the river violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats in North America. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Tritonia riparia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in marshy areas. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
