    "intro": "Thelypteris schaffneri, commonly known as the Schaffner's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Thelypteris schaffneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
