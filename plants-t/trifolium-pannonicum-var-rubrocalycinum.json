    "intro": "Trifolium pannonicum var. rubrocalycinum, commonly known as the red-calyx clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly hairy surface. The flowers are small and typically pink or red, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. This variety is distinguished by its distinctive red calyx that persists after the petals fall. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks."
