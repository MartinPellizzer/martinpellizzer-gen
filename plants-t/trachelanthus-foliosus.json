    "intro": "Trachelanthus foliosus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that disperse easily by wind. Its leaves are alternate, narrow, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Trachelanthus foliosus is well adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
