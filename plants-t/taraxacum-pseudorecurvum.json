    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudorecurvum, commonly known as the Canadian dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to North America and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves. The plant produces a yellow composite flower that develops into a hollow, hairless stem with a crown of bracts. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, and it is considered an herbaceous perennial. The species is closely related to other dandelion species but is distinguished by its unique morphology and geographic distribution."
