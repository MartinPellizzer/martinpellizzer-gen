    "intro": "Taraxacum microspermum, commonly known as the small-seeded dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow flowering head that develops into a fluffy seed head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday. The seeds are dispersed by wind, facilitated by the parachute-like structure of the pappus."
