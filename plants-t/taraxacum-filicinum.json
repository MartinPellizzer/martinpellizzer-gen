    "intro": "Taraxacum filicinum, commonly known as the fernleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single flower head composed of yellow ray florets. Its flowers develop into a distinctive spherical seed head, known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Taraxacum filicinum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, showcasing its adaptability to various environments."
