    "intro": "Taraxacum nothum, commonly known as the hybrid dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Taraxacum nothum is often found in disturbed soils and open areas, thriving in temperate climates. Its botanical features make it a common weed in lawns and gardens across Europe and parts of Asia."
