    "intro": "Taraxacum decastroi, commonly known as the Decastro's dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a puffball of seeds. Native to South America, particularly Argentina, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant has a taproot system and produces a milky sap when damaged. It is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
