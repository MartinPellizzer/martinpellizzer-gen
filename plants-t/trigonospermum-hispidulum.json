It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it adapts well to dry and nutrient-poor conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
