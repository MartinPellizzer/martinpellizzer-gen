    "intro": "Tapeinidium novoguineense, commonly known as the Guinean tapeinidium, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related trees. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It produces small, woody fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range."
