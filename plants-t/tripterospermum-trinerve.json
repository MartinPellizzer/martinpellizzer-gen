It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite leaves with three distinct veins. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that are clustered in racemes, typical of the viola family. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and taxonomy. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats in the Andean regions."
