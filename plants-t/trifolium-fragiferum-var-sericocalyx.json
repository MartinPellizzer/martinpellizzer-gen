    "intro": "Trifolium fragiferum var. sericocalyx, commonly known as the silken-hair clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet having a silvery-white pubescence that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pink to violet flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grassy areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
