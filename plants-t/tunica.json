    "intro": "Tunica, commonly known as the tunica, is a specialized plant structure found in the outer layer of some plants, particularly in the shoot apical meristem. It plays a crucial role in regulating cell differentiation and maintaining the plant's growth pattern. The tunica is composed of tightly packed, undifferentiated cells that help protect the developing tissues. It is distinct from the corpus, which lies beneath the tunica. This structure is essential for the proper development and organization of plant organs."
