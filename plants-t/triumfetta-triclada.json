    "intro": "Triumfetta triclada, commonly known as the three-leaved glory or false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, featuring opposite, trifoliate leaves composed of three elliptical to ovate leaflets. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, often with a prominent central stigma. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Triumfetta triclada is often used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant."
