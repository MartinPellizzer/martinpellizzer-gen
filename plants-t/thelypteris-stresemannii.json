    "intro": "Thelypteris stresemannii, commonly known as the Stresemann's shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, spore-bearing sori on the underside of its fertile fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments such as tropical forests and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in moist soil. The leaves are usually leathery and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance, which contributes to its common name."
