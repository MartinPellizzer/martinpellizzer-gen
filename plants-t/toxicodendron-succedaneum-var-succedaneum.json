    "intro": "Toxicodendron succedaneum var. succedaneum, commonly known as poison ivy, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three lance-shaped leaflets arranged oppositely on the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red, fuzzy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is well-known for its urushiol oil, which causes severe allergic reactions upon contact with the skin. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests, fields, and along roadsides."
