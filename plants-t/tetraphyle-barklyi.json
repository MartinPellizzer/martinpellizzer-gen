    "intro": "Tetraphyle barklyi, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and green. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as critically endangered."
