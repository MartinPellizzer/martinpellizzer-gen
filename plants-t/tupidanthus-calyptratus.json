    "intro": "Tupidanthus calyptratus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant has a thick, waxy leaf surface that helps it float on water while preventing water loss. Its flowers, which are usually white or pink, bloom at night and emit a strong fragrance to attract pollinators. Tupidanthus calyptratus plays an important ecological role in its native wetlands by supporting biodiversity and contributing to water filtration."
