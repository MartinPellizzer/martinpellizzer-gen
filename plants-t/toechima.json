    "intro": "Toechima, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Burseraceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are characterized by their aromatic resinous sap, which is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of incense. Toechima species typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers. The wood of some species is highly valued for its durability and distinctive color, making it a sought-after material in woodworking."
