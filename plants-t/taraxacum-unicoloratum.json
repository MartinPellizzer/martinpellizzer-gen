    "intro": "Taraxacum unicoloratum, commonly known as the single-colored dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow flowers that transition to white fluffy seeds, a common feature among dandelions. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette and are usually hairy, which helps in water retention. The species is notable for its unique coloration, with flowers that lack the usual green veins, making it visually distinct from other dandelion species."
