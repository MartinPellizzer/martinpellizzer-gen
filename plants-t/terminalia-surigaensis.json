    "intro": "Terminalia surigaensis, commonly known as the Philippine Terminalia, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is often found in lowland to montane forests and is valued for its hard, heavy wood. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
