    "intro": "Tulipa alpestris, commonly known as the alpine tulip, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and are often accompanied by a distinctive, fragrant scent. This species is adapted to cold, alpine environments and prefers well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. It is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
