    "intro": "Triumfetta effusa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false nettle, is a tropical and subtropical shrub belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It is native to Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain regions."
