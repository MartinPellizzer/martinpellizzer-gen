    "intro": "Tragus, commonly known as the goat's beard, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. The plants are characterized by their distinctive, hairy, bract-like structures that resemble a beard, giving them their common name. They typically grow as annual or biennial herbs, often found in dry, rocky, or sandy soils. The flowers are usually small and yellow, arranged in clusters that bloom from late spring to early autumn."
