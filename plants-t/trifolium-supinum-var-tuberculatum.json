    "intro": "Trifolium supinum var. tuberculatum, commonly known as the tuberculate clover, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and trifoliate leaves with rounded or heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its tuberculate (wart-like) texture on the stems and leaves is a distinguishing feature. This species thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
