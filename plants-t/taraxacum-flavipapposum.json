    "intro": "Taraxacum flavipapposum, commonly known as the yellow pappus dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets and a distinctive, fluffy white pappus that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. Native to Europe, it thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows and disturbed soils. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves and produces a hollow, hairy stem that supports its flowering head. It is often found in temperate regions and is considered a minor weed in some agricultural settings."
