It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.
