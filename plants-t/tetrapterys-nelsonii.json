    "intro": "Tetrapterys nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the tropical regions of Central and South America. It has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically white or greenish-white, arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Its botanical characteristics reflect adaptations to its parasitic lifestyle and ecological niche within forest ecosystems."
