    "intro": "Thymus hyemalis subsp. saxicola, commonly known as the winter thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically forms dense mats of aromatic, gray-green foliage with small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers during late winter to early spring, often before the leaves appear. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
