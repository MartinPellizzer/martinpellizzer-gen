    "intro": "Tanacetum pulchellum, commonly known as the meadow tansy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks, preferring moist to moderately dry soils. Its yellow flowers are borne in flat-topped clusters, and the leaves are finely divided with a strong aromatic scent. Tanacetum pulchellum is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported digestive and antiseptic properties."
