    "intro": "Tecticornia willisii, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and insects. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Tecticornia willisii is well adapted to saline soils and is often found in coastal dunes and salt lakes."
