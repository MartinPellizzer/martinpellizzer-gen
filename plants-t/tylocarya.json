These plants are characterized by their spiny leaves and showy composite flower heads, which typically consist of both ray and disk florets. Tylocarya species are native to regions of Asia, particularly the mountains of China and the Himalayas. They thrive in high-altitude environments and are often found in rocky or alpine habitats. The genus includes several species, such as Tylocarya sinensis, which is known for its medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine."
