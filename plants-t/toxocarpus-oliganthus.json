    "intro": "Toxocarpus oliganthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waxflower, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its native arid environment. Toxocarpus oliganthus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
