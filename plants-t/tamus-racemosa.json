    "intro": "Tamus racemosa, commonly known as the clustered pogostemon, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers on tall, slender stalks, which bloom in the spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. The plant is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
