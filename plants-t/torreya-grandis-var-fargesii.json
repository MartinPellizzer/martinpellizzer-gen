    "intro": "Torreya grandis var. fargesii, commonly known as the Chinese torreya, is a rare evergreen conifer native to China. It is characterized by its elongated, needle-like leaves and conical shape, often growing in mountainous regions. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that release seeds in the fall. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other parts of the world for horticultural purposes. Due to its limited natural range and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
