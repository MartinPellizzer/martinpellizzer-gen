    "intro": "Tithymalus schickendantzii, commonly known as the Schickendantz's tithymalus, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific alpine regions. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in umbels, a feature typical of the carrot family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
