    "intro": "Tillandsia walter-richteri, commonly known as the Walter-Richteri air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, adapting it to its often arid habitat. It produces small, colorful flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
