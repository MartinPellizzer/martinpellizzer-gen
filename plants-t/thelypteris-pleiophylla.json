    "intro": "Thelypteris pleiophylla, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomes are often submerged or partially submerged in water, allowing it to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their striking appearance."
