    "intro": "Tillandsia nitida, commonly known as the silver vane air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in humid, well-lit environments and requires regular misting to maintain moisture. Tillandsia nitida is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique look and low maintenance requirements."
