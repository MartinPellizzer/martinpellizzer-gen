    "intro": "Torreycactus conothelos subsp. argenteus, commonly known as the silver-torrey cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
