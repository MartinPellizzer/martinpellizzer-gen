    "intro": "Trapa longicarpa f. elata, commonly known as the elongated water chestnut, is a variant of the water chestnut species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, spongy fruit that floats on the water surface. The plant typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are broad and floating, with a thick, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The species is notable for its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems and its potential use in traditional medicine."
