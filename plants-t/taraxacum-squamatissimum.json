    "intro": "Taraxacum squamatissimum, commonly known as the scaly dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, scaly leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces a tall, hollow stem topped with a single flower head composed of numerous small, yellow ray florets. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
