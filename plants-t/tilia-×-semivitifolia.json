    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 semivitifolia, commonly known as the hybrid linden, is a deciduous tree that results from the cross between Tilia cordata and Tilia tomentosa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically larger and more hairy than those of its parent species. The tree produces fragrant, pale yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in early summer. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This hybrid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types and climatic conditions."
