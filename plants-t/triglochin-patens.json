    "intro": "Triglochin patens, commonly known as the flatleaf marsh grass, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are flat on both sides, giving it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are usually white or greenish in color. Triglochin patens is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
