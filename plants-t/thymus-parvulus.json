    "intro": "Thymus parvulus, commonly known as small thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features tiny, aromatic leaves that are densely packed on creeping stems, forming a mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and other compounds, contribute to its use in herbal medicine and culinary applications. Thymus parvulus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and ground covers."
