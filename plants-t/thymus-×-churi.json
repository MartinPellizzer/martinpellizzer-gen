The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to violet flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its use in herbal medicine and culinary applications."
