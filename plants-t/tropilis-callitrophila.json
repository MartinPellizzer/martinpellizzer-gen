    "intro": "Tropilis callitrophila, commonly known as the goldenrod leafminer, is a species of moth belonging to the family Tachinidae. It is native to North America and is known for its larvae that feed on the leaves of goldenrod plants. The adult moths are small, with metallic green or bronze-colored wings. The life cycle of Tropilis callitrophila involves the larvae burrowing into the leaves, causing characteristic mines. This plant pest is often found in habitats where goldenrod is abundant, such as meadows and disturbed areas."
