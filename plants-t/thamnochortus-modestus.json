    "intro": "Thamnochortus modestus, commonly known as the dwarf broom, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. Thamnochortus modestus is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region, with periods of dormancy during the wet season."
