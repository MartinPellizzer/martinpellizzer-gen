    "intro": "Tillandsia brunonis, commonly known as the Brazilian air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It thrives by attaching itself to trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its specialized leaves rather than through roots. The plant features a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, waxy leaves that help retain water. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often emerging from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia brunonis is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires careful watering to prevent rot."
