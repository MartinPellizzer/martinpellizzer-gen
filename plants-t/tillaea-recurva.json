    "intro": "Tillaea recurva, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a small, flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and pale green, succulent leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers with prominent, fleshy sepals, which are adapted to conserve water in harsh conditions. Tillaea recurva is often found growing on limestone or sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xerophytic environments, and it is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
