It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, oval pods containing several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system. The species is also valued for its potential nutritional and medicinal properties."
