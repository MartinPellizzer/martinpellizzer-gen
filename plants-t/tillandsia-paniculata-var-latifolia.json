    "intro": "Tillandsia paniculata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant features rosettes of wide, strap-like leaves that can store water, adapted to its arid and shaded habitats. It produces striking inflorescences with showy, bell-shaped flowers that attract pollinators. This variety is popular among plant enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
