    "intro": "Tragacantha lateritia, commonly known as the desert tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in harsh, dry environments, often found in rocky soils and sandy deserts. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its latex sap, similar to that of the common tragacanth, has been used traditionally for medicinal and industrial purposes. Due to its resilience, it plays a vital role in stabilizing desert ecosystems and preventing soil erosion."
