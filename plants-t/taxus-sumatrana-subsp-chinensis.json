    "intro": "Taxus sumatrana subsp. chinensis, commonly known as Chinese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves and produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal. It is also notable for containing taxine alkaloids, which have medicinal significance. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare in the wild."
