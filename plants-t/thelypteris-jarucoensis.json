    "intro": "Thelypteris jarucoensis, commonly known as the Jaruco fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Lesser Antilles. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
