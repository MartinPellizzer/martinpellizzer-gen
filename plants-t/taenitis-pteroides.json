    "intro": "Taenitis pteroides, commonly known as the feather-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping underground stems that help it spread. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are arranged in a dense, bushy pattern. Taenitis pteroides thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
