It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually short and have a distinct, arching shape, with a pale green to silvery hue. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in protected or conservation areas."
