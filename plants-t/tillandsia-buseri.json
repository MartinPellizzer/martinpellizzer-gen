    "intro": "Tillandsia buseri, commonly known as the Buser's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically long and strap-like, forming a rosette that helps collect moisture from the air. The plant produces small, colorful flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and orange. It is well adapted to humid, shady environments and requires minimal care when grown in the right conditions."
