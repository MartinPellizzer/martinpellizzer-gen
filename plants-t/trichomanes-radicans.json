    "intro": "Trichomanes radicans, commonly known as the creeping holly fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and they often form dense mats on the forest floor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid woodlands and along stream banks. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
