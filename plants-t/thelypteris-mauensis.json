    "intro": "Thelypteris mauensis, commonly known as the Mau fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
