    "intro": "Thelypteris piedrensis var. heterotricha, commonly known as the heterotrichous rock fern, is a variant of the rock fern genus Thelypteris. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that exhibit a unique dimorphism in the arrangement of its pinnae, with some segments being more upright and others more spreading. This plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often found in humid, temperate regions. Its leaves are usually leathery and have a rough texture, which helps it retain moisture in its preferred habitat. The species is of interest to botanists due to its morphological variation and ecological adaptability."
