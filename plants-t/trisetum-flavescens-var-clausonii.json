It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often covered in a fine, yellowish or golden hue, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a soft, silky texture. The inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers."
