    "intro": "Tabacina, commonly known as the tobacco plant, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and usually hairy leaves that are often lance-shaped or ovate. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing numerous elliptical seeds. Tabacina is native to the Americas but has been widely cultivated worldwide for its psychoactive alkaloids, particularly nicotine. Its botanical features make it both economically significant and ecologically notable."
