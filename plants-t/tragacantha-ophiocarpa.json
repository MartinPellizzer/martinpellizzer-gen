    "intro": "Tragacantha ophiocarpa, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive, resinous pods. Its latex sap, known as tragacanth, has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to poor soils and drought conditions."
