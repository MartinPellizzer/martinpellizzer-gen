    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudo-officinale, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flowering head. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seed heads, which are dispersed by the wind. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. Taraxacum pseudo-officinale is known for its medicinal properties and is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed soils."
