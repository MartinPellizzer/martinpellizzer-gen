    "intro": "Themeda ciliata, commonly known as the silky grass or silky windmill grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades and tufted inflorescence that resembles a windmill. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and woodland areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving it a silky appearance, and it produces small, pale green flowers in the spring. Themeda ciliata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
