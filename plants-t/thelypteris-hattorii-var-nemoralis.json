    "intro": "Thelypteris hattorii var. nemoralis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a variant of the common hattori fern. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often found in forested areas. The plant features fronds that are leathery and somewhat crinkled, with a dark green coloration. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. This variant is notable for its adaptability to poor soil conditions and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded habitats."
