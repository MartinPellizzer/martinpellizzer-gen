It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and typically grows in moist, rocky habitats. The plant features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. It is characterized by its slender stems and is often found in alpine meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers cool, shaded conditions."
