    "intro": "Tragacantha chamissonis, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with prominent orange stamens, typical of the Malvaceae family. Its latex sap, which is milky and sticky, has been used traditionally for various purposes. Tragacantha chamissonis is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or rocky soils."
