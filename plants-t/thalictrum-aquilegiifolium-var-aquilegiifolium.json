    "intro": "Thalictrum aquilegiifolium var. aquilegiifolium, commonly known as the water avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to moist woodland habitats. It features delicate, fern-like leaves with a basal rosette structure and produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of white to pale pink. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender stems that bear small, spurred flowers. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires consistently moist, well-drained soil. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and wetland restoration projects."
