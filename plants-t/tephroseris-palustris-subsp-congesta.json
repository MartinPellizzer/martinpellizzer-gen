    "intro": "Tephroseris palustris subsp. congesta, commonly known as the marsh tephroseris, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in pollination. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in moist, often nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is often found in bogs and marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
