    "intro": "Triplasis setacea, commonly known as the hairy tamarind, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in short, stiff hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture. Triplasis setacea is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates."
