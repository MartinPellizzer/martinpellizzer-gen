    "intro": "Thymus flexicaulis, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to rocky and arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive, minty fragrance. The plant produces tiny, pink or white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for rock gardens and dry soil conditions. Thymus flexicaulis is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in herbal medicine."
