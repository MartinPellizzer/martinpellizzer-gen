    "intro": "Tetragonolobus requienii, commonly known as the African senna, is a small shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its quadrangular stems and bipinnate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, bean-like pods. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
