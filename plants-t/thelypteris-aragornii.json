    "intro": "Thelypteris aragornii, commonly known as the Aragorn fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread through the forest floor, forming dense mats. Thelypteris aragornii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
