    "intro": "Taraxacum languidulum, commonly known as the pale dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and herbaceous growth habit. The plant features a basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a slender, hairy stem that supports a single flower head. Its yellow flowers open in the morning and are followed by a puffball of seeds for wind dispersal. The species is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
