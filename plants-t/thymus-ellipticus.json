    "intro": "Thymus ellipticus, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features aromatic, narrow elliptic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, are valued for their medicinal and culinary uses."
