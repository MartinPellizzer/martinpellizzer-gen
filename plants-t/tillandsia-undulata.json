    "intro": "Tillandsia undulata, commonly known as the curled air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant does not require soil to grow and instead attaches itself to trees or rocks. It produces small, showy flowers that can range in color from white to pink or purple. Tillandsia undulata is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
