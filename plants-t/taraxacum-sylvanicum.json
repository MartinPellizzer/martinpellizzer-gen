    "intro": "Taraxacum sylvanicum, commonly known as the forest dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in woodlands, meadows, and along forest edges, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, with a hairy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. Its flowers develop into a distinctive, hollow, globe-shaped seed head known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. The species is characterized by its resilience and ability to colonize disturbed or shaded habitats."
