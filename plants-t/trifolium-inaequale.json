    "intro": "Trifolium inaequale, commonly known as the unequal clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three unequal-sized leaflets, giving it its common name. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, this plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple, and it is often used as a forage crop for livestock. Trifolium inaequale is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
