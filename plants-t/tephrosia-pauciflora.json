It typically grows as an annual or biennial plant with slender, erect stems and alternate leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, and often have a distinctive yellow or greenish color with a contrasting purple or brownish hue. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or pea family, and is characterized by its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
