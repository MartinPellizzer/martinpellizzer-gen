It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing a robust root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its bright yellow flower heads consist of numerous tiny florets, which mature into fluffy white seeds dispersed by the wind. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
