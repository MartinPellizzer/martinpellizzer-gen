It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in whorls along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Teucrium multinodum is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
