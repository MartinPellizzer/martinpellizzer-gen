    "intro": "Tillandsia makoyana, commonly known as the Makoy's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom once in its lifetime. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
