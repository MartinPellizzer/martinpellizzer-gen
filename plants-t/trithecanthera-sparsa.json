It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its thorny branches and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by small, woody fruits. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
