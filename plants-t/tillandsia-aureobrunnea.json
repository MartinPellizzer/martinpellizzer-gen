    "intro": "Tillandsia aureobrunnea, commonly known as the golden-brown tillandsia, is a species of air plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows on trees or rocks. The plant is characterized by its dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it collect moisture from the air. Its foliage is usually a mix of green and brown hues, giving it its common name. Tillandsia aureobrunnea is epiphytic, meaning it derives its nutrients and moisture from the air, rain, and debris around it rather than from soil."
