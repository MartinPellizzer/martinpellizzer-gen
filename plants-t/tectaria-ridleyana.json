    "intro": "Tectaria ridleyana, commonly known as the Ridley's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on trees in humid, tropical environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually leathery and dark green, with a rugged texture that aids in water retention. Tectaria ridleyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, moist gardens."
