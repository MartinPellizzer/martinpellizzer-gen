    "intro": "Tabernaemontana prancei, commonly known as the Prance's star of Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
