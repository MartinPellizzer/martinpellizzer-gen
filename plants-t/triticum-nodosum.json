This plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates. Its botanical features include slender, often branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. Triticum nodosum is notable for its genetic diversity, which makes it a valuable resource in breeding programs for improving wheat varieties. It also serves as a host for certain beneficial microorganisms that contribute to soil health."
