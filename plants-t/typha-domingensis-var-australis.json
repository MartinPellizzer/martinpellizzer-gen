    "intro": "Typha domingensis var. australis, commonly known as the Australian cattail, is a perennial wetland plant native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of brown, silky flowers. The plant thrives in freshwater wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its rhizomes form extensive underground networks, allowing it to spread rapidly and colonize new areas. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
