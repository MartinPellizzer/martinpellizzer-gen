    "intro": "Trichilia diversifolia, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, three-lobed fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of incense. Trichilia diversifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
