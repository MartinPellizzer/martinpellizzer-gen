    "intro": "Thelypteris leucophlebia, commonly known as the silver fern, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Thelypteris leucophlebia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
