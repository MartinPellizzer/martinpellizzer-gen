    "intro": "Thelypteris bibrachiata, commonly known as the broad-leaved shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into numerous small, pointed leaflets. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the undersides of the fronds. Thelypteris bibrachiata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
