    "intro": "Taraxacum exile, commonly known as the slender dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stem and small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, hairless stem with a milky sap that is typical of the genus Taraxacum. Its leaves are alternate, basal, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This species is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, showing a preference for temperate climates."
