    "intro": "Tillandsia oropezana, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Mexico. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil for growth, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. It produces small, colorful flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
