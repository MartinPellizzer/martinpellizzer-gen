    "intro": "Tristemma involucratum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to the prominent foliage. Tristemma involucratum is typically found in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and forest edges. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
