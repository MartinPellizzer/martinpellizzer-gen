    "intro": "Thelypteris hexagonoptera f. simonsii, commonly known as the Simons' shield fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. Its fronds are typically leathery and have a dense, compact structure, with pinnae that are often arranged in a regular pattern. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a thin, membranous layer known as the indusium. This fern is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas."
