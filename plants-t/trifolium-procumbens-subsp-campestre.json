    "intro": "Trifolium procumbens subsp. campestre, commonly known as creeping clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and grassy areas. It has a creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
