    "intro": "Thalictrum maritimum, commonly known as sea avens, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and establish itself in challenging coastal environments. Thalictrum maritimum plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
