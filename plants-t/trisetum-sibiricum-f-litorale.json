    "intro": "Trisetum sibiricum f. litorale, commonly known as the coastal bottlebrush grass, is a variant of the Siberian bottlebrush grass. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in coastal areas, characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are often reddish in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. This form is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
