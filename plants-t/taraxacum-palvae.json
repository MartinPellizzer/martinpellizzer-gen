    "intro": "Taraxacum palvae, commonly known as the narrowleaf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, showy yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Taraxacum palvae is a perennial herb that thrives in temperate climates and is relatively hardy, making it a common sight in many natural habitats."
