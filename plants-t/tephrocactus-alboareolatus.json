It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly areolas, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the areola level. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water. Due to its unique features, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in desert gardens."
