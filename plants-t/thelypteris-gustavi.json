    "intro": "Thelypteris gustavi, commonly known as the Gustav's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its lanceolate, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, finger-like pinnae. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
