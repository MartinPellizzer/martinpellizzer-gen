    "intro": "Trifolium fleischeri, commonly known as the Fleischer's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
