    "intro": "Thalictrum micrandrum, commonly known as the small-flowered meadow rue, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse seeds by wind. Thalictrum micrandrum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and subtle floral display."
