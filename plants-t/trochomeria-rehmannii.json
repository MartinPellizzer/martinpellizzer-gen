    "intro": "Trochomeria rehmannii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system consists of fibrous roots that help it anchor in soil and absorb nutrients. Trochomeria rehmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
