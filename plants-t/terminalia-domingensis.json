    "intro": "Terminalia domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican ebony, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its dark, heavy wood that is highly valued for its density and appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by small, three-lobed fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth surface, while its bark is rough and fissured. Terminalia domingensis is often found in moist lowland forests and is known for its ecological and economic significance in the region."
