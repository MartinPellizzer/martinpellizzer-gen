It has a distinctive yellowish to orange coloration due to the presence of the pigment usnic acid. The plant forms a flat, leaf-like thallus with a smooth upper surface and a more rugged lower surface. It thrives on tree trunks and branches, often in shaded, moist environments. Thelocephala fulva is known for its slow growth and is used as an indicator species in ecological studies."
