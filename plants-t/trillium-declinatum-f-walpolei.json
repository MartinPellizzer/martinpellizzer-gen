    "intro": "Trillium declinatum f. walpolei, commonly known as the Walpole's white trillium, is a rare and striking botanical species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its three large, white, showy petals and three sepals that are often a different color, typically green or red. The plant has a distinct three-part leaf structure and produces a single, upright stem with a single flower. It blooms in early spring and is often found in shaded, moist woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
