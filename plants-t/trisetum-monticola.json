    "intro": "Trisetum monticola, commonly known as the mountain hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in rocky or disturbed areas. Trisetum monticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
