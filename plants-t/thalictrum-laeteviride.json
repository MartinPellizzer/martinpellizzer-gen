It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early to mid-summer, which are borne on tall, slender stems. Thalictrum laeteviride is typically found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream sides. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and subtle floral display."
