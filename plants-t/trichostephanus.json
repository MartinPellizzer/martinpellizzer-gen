These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. They are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The leaves are typically alternate, palmately lobed, and often covered in fine hairs.
