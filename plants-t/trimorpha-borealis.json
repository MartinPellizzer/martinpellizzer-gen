    "intro": "Trimorpha borealis, commonly known as the northern trimorpha, is a flowering plant native to the colder regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth margin, and it produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Trimorpha borealis plays an important role in early pollination by providing nectar to emerging pollinators."
