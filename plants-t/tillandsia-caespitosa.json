    "intro": "Tillandsia caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant forms dense clusters of small, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, which attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
