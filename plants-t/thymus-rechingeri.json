    "intro": "Thymus rechingeri, commonly known as Rechinger's thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used traditionally for its antiseptic and aromatic qualities."
