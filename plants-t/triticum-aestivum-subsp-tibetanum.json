    "intro": "Triticum aestivum subsp. tibetanum, commonly known as Tibetan wheatgrass, is a wild relative of common wheat that is native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its short, dense growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny grains. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and can thrive in poor soils, making it resilient to harsh climatic conditions. Its grains are often used in traditional Tibetan cuisine and have been studied for their nutritional and medicinal properties. Due to its unique genetic makeup, it is also of interest in agricultural research for improving wheat varieties."
