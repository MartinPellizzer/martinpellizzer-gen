    "intro": "Trifolium villiferum, commonly known as the hairy trefoil, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets with hairy surfaces, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. Trifolium villiferum is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
