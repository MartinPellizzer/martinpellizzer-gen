    "intro": "Theobroma bicolor, commonly known as the pink cocoa tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Sterculiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive pink or red flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces edible pods that contain seeds used in the production of chocolate, though it is less commercially significant than Theobroma cacao. Its leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture, while its bark is thick and often used in traditional medicine. Theobroma bicolor is also valued for its ornamental appeal due to its vibrant floral display."
