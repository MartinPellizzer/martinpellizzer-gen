    "intro": "Thelypteris scalpturoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in a fine, scaly texture. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded areas, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Thelypteris scalpturoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
