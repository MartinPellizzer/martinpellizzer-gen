    "intro": "Tenoria plantaginea, commonly known as the marsh gentian, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and thrives in areas with standing water or saturated ground. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and somewhat hairy. The marsh gentian plays an important role in supporting local insect populations, particularly bees and butterflies."
