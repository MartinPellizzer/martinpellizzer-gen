    "intro": "Taraxacum hjeltii, commonly known as the Hjelt's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to parts of Europe and is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves. The plant produces a slender, hollow stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. Its flowers are followed by a distinctive, fluffy seed head that aids in wind dispersal. Taraxacum hjeltii is typically found in grassy areas and is adapted to temperate climates."
