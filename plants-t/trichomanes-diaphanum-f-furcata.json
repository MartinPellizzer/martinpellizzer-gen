    "intro": "Trichomanes diaphanum f. furcata, commonly known as the forked water fern, is a rare fern species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant exhibits a unique branching pattern, with the fronds often splitting into two at the base, giving it the \"forked\" appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
