    "intro": "Thelypteris lebeufii, commonly known as the Lebeuf's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, shield-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in the soil. Thelypteris lebeufii is often found in association with other epiphytic and terrestrial ferns in its native habitat."
