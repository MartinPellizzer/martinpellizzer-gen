    "intro": "Toxicoscordion paniculatum, commonly known as the western gourd or false cucumber, is a member of the Araceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive yellowish-green spadices that resemble a cucumber. It is highly toxic due to the presence of calcium oxalate crystals, which can cause severe irritation and swelling upon contact or ingestion. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with great caution."
