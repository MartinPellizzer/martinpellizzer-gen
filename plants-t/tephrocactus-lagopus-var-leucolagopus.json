    "intro": "Tephrocactus lagopus var. leucolagopus, commonly known as the white-lagopus cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems covered in dense, white to pale blue spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often followed by small, red fruits. Native to the arid regions of northern Mexico, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
