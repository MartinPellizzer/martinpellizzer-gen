    "intro": "Turbinicarpus saueri subsp. nieblae, commonly known as the Nieblae's turbinicarpus, is a succulent cactus native to southern Africa. It features a globular to cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure, which helps it store water in its arid environment. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
