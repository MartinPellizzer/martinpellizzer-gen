It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this species thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces a distinctive seed head with pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and garden settings."
