    "intro": "Thismia kelabitiana, commonly known as the Kelabit ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Thismiaceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces small, white, lantern-like flowers that are highly specialized for pollination by specific insects. Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and is rarely seen in the wild. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique species from habitat loss and over-collection."
