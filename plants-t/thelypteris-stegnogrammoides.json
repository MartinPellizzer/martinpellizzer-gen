    "intro": "Thelypteris stegnogrammoides, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, shield-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions where humidity is high. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in forest understories. The fronds are usually evergreen, with a soft texture and a pale green color, making it a notable ornamental plant in horticulture."
