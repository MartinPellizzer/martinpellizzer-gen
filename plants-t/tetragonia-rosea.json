    "intro": "Tetragonia rosea, commonly known as the rose saltbush, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, tangy fruits resembling tiny green apples. Tetragonia rosea thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal and inland arid regions. It is also valued for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to tolerate and accumulate heavy metals."
