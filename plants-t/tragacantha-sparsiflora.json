    "intro": "Tragacantha sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparsely-flowered tragacanth, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, which bloom in late spring. Its seeds are encased in a hard, resinous pod, a feature that contributes to its historical use in traditional medicine and as a natural gum. Tragacantha sparsiflora is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in scrubland and rocky habitats."
