    "intro": "Taxillus viguieri, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Mediterranean, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as oaks and pines. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that are dispersed by birds. Its growth is slow, and it forms dense clusters on the host's branches. Taxillus viguieri plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects."
