    "intro": "Taraxacum harbhajan-singhii subsp. harbhajan-singhii, commonly known as the Harbhajan Singh's dandelion, is a rare and recently described subspecies of the dandelion genus. It is characterized by its yellow composite flower heads and a basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves. The plant is native to specific regions in the Indian subcontinent, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. Its botanical features include a taproot system and the production of a distinctive seed head with parachute-like seeds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
