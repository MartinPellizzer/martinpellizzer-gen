    "intro": "Triainolepis opaca, commonly known as the slender leaved fern, is a perennial plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that are often arching or cascading. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, scale-like structures along the leaf margins. Triainolepis opaca is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
