    "intro": "Trapa sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It features broad, shield-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a short petiole that anchors it to the submerged stems. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom above the water, followed by distinctive, triangular fruits that disperse by floating. Trapa sibirica thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as lakes and ponds. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
