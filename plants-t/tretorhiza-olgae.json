    "intro": "Tretorhiza olgae, commonly known as the coastal tretorhiza, is a flowering plant native to specific regions along the Atlantic coast. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to saline and windy environments. The plant produces delicate, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is highly specialized, allowing it to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. Tretorhiza olgae plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
