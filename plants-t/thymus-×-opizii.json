    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 opizii, commonly known as the hybrid thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is a cross between Thymus serpyllum (wild thyme) and Thymus praecox (caraway thyme), resulting in a plant with a distinctive aromatic foliage. The leaves are small, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance. It produces small, pale pink or lavender flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. This plant is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and as a culinary herb due to its strong, minty fragrance."
