    "intro": "Tittmannia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf tittmannia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often in shades of white or pale green. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
