    "intro": "Tetraphyle columnaris var. prolifera, commonly known as the creeping columnar cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America. It features a stem that grows horizontally along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, green, spiny leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the axils of the leaves. It is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal watering once established."
