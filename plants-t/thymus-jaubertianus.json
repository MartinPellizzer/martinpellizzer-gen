    "intro": "Thymus jaubertianus, commonly known as Jaubert's thyme, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with aromatic, small, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for both its fragrance and visual appeal."
