    "intro": "Thlaspi montanum var. idahoense, commonly known as Idaho mountain cress, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. The plant features basal leaves that are pinnately divided, with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly areas. This variety is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its adaptation to high-altitude environments."
