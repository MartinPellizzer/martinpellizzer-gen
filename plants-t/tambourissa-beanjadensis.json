    "intro": "Tambourissa beanjadensis, commonly known as the golden spire vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. However, it requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive optimally."
