    "intro": "Tosagris, commonly known as the silverleaf sage, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It features silvery-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal remedies for their purported medicinal properties. Tosagris is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in semi-desert ecosystems."
