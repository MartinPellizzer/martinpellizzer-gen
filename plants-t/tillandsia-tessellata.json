    "intro": "Tillandsia tessellata, commonly known as the mosaic air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps in capturing moisture from the air. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Tillandsia tessellata is native to Central and South America and thrives in humid, shaded environments."
