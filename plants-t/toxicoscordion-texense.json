    "intro": "Toxicoscordion texense, commonly known as the Texas death scorpion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces toxic alkaloids, particularly scopolamine and hyoscyamine, which make it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its toxicity, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
