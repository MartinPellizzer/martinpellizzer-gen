    "intro": "Taraxacum sublimiforme, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to high-altitude regions of the European Alps and is characterized by its hairy, dark green leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant is adapted to cold climates and thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. It produces a distinctive, elongated seed head that releases lightweight seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystems."
