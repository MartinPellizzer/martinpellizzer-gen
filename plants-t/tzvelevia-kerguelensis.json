    "intro": "Tzvelevia kerguelensis, commonly known as the Kerguelen's flax, is a flowering plant native to the subantarctic region of the Kerguelen Islands. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in coastal areas with nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, leafy stems and produces small, blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Tzvelevia kerguelensis is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing food for native insects and birds."
