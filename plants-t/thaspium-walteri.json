    "intro": "Thaspium walteri, commonly known as Walter's thaspium, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
