    "intro": "Thlaspi alpestre subsp. tatrense, commonly known as the alpine rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often on mountain slopes and cliffs. It has hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in harsh, high-altitude environments. Thlaspi alpestre subsp. tatrense is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in areas with limited soil coverage."
