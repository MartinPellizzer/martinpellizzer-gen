    "intro": "Taraxacum wendelboanum, commonly known as the Wendelbo's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in alpine and arctic regions, characterized by its yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, and the flower heads are surrounded by bracts. This species is notable for its ability to survive in harsh climates due to its cold tolerance and efficient water conservation mechanisms."
