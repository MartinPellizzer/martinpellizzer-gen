    "intro": "Trifolium ciliolatum, commonly known as the hairy clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with fine hairs along the edges. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas and along stream banks. Trifolium ciliolatum is a perennial herb that plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility."
