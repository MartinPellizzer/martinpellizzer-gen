    "intro": "Trisetum michelii, commonly known as Michel's hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a soft texture, and it has small, wind-pollinated flowers. Trisetum michelii is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates."
