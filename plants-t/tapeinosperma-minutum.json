    "intro": "Tapeinosperma minutum, commonly known as the dwarf tamarind, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, round, yellow fruits that are covered in a fine, hairy coating. It is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in saline and coastal conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental plant in coastal gardens."
