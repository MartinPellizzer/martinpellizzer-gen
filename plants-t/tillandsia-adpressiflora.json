    "intro": "Tillandsia adpressiflora, commonly known as the flat-flowered air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
