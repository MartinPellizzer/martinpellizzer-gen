    "intro": "Tilia glabra var. neglecta, commonly known as the common lime or small-leaf lime, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical Tilia glabra. The flowers are fragrant and yellow, appearing in early summer, and the tree produces small, round fruits called samaras. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a versatile ornamental and shade tree in temperate climates. This variety is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic value and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
