    "intro": "Thelypteris yaucoensis, commonly known as Yauco fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Caribbean, particularly Puerto Rico. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically\u4e1b\u751f (clumped) in appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are usually bioluminescent and have a distinctive, finely divided structure, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Thelypteris yaucoensis thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
