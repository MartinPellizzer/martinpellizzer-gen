    "intro": "Tournefortia longifolia, commonly known as the long-flowered tournefortia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters, characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in the spring or early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Tournefortia longifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in coastal areas."
