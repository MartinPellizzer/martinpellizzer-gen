    "intro": "Tristagma uniflorum f. violaceum, commonly known as the violet-flowered tristagma, is a rare and striking variant of the tristagma genus. This plant is characterized by its unique violet-colored flowers, which contrast sharply with its typical white or pale pink blooms. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is native to specific regions in the southwestern United States. The foliage is typically broad and lance-shaped, with a silvery underside that adds to its ornamental appeal. Due to its rarity and distinctive appearance, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of rare plants."
