    "intro": "Tetraplasia lutchuensis, commonly known as the Lutchu Island fern, is a rare vascular plant native to the island of Lutchu in the Andaman Sea. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that emerge from a short, creeping rhizome. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tetraplasia lutchuensis is considered a vulnerable species."
