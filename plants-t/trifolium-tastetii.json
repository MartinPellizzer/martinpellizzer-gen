    "intro": "Trifolium tastetii, commonly known as the Tastet's clover, is a rare species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Native to specific regions in Europe, it thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in grassy habitats. The plant has a low-growing habit and produces pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
