    "intro": "Thelypteris splendens, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its bright, glossy fronds that often display a striking golden hue, especially in direct sunlight. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. Thelypteris splendens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
