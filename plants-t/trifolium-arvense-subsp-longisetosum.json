    "intro": "Trifolium arvense subsp. longisetosum, commonly known as the long-hairy clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval to lanceolate leaflets with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its hairy stems and leaves help it retain moisture and resist herbivory."
