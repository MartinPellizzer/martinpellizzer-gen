    "intro": "Taraxacum subundulatum, commonly known as the waved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that form a dense cluster near the ground. The plant produces a single, hollow, leaf-like stem that terminates in a spherical, yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. Its flowers are typically followed by a pappus-based seed head, which aids in wind dispersal. This species is native to parts of Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils."
