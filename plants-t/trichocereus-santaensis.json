    "intro": "Trichocereus santaensis, commonly known as the Santa Helena cactus, is a species native to the Andes Mountains of Peru. It is a tall, columnar cactus with a smooth, green stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers during the night, which are typically short-lived but striking in appearance. Its spines are relatively short and soft compared to other cacti in the genus. Trichocereus santaensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also studied for its potential psychoactive properties."
