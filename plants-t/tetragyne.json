    "intro": "Tetragyne, commonly known as the four-winged fig, is a rare and unique species within the Moraceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive four-winged fruits, which are adapted for wind dispersal. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture. The botanical interest in Tetragyne lies in its unusual morphology and ecological role in supporting specific pollinators."
