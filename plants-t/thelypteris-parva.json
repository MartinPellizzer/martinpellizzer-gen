    "intro": "Thelypteris parva, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a small evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with clustered, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, hairy scales. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Thelypteris parva is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its compact size and attractive foliage."
