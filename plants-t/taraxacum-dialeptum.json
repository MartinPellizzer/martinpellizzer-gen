    "intro": "Taraxacum dialeptum, commonly known as the narrowleaf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a yellow flowering head that produces a distinctive pappus for wind dispersal. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has a taproot system and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other sunny areas. It is a common weed but also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
