    "intro": "Tropilis tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly folded. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Tropilis tetragona is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
