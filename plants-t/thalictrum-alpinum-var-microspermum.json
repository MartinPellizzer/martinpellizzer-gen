    "intro": "Thalictrum alpinum var. microspermum, commonly known as the Alpine meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and prefers well-drained, moist soils in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity in alpine habitats. The variety is distinguished by its smaller seeds compared to the typical form of Thalictrum alpinum."
