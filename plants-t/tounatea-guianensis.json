It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in local crafts and construction."
