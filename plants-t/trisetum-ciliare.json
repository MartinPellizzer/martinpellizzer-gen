    "intro": "Trisetum ciliare, commonly known as the silky hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, soft, and silky appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and wetlands. Trisetum ciliare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
