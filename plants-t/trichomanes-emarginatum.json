    "intro": "Trichomanes emarginatum, commonly known as the marginal holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually clustered at the base, with a creeping rhizome that helps in spreading the plant. Trichomanes emarginatum is noted for its small, inconspicuous spore cases, which are borne on the underside of the fronds."
