It is native to Central Asia and is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, hollow, yellow flower stem that bears a composite flower head. It is a perennial herb that thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky soils. Its morphology and ecological adaptations reflect its role as a pioneer species in disturbed environments."
