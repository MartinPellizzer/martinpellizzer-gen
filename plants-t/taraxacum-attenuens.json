    "intro": "Taraxacum attenuens, commonly known as the slender dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated flower stem that bears a composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, and often spiky seed head that disperses seeds via the wind. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Taraxacum attenuens is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 centimeters."
