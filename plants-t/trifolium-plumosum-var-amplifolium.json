    "intro": "Trifolium plumosum var. amplifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved clover, is a variant of the common clover species characterized by its larger, more robust leaves. This plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, which are typically hairy and lobed. The flowers are small, pink or white, and arranged in dense clusters, making it a visually appealing plant. It is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage crop for livestock."
