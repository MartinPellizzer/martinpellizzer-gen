    "intro": "Tsuga canadensis var. dawsoniana, commonly known as Dawson's hemlock, is a rare variant of the eastern hemlock. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The tree produces small, spherical cones that are reddish-brown when mature. It is native to the Appalachian Mountains and thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
