    "intro": "Turbinicarpus schmiedickeanus subsp. dickisoniae, commonly known as the Dickison's Turbinicarpus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its rounded, ribbed stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is a slow-growing species that requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered cactus."
