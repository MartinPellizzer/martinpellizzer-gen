    "intro": "Trapa longicarpa var. loricata, commonly known as the lacquered water chestnut, is a rare aquatic plant native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive, helmet-shaped fruits that are covered in a thick, waxy layer resembling lacquer. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater habitats, such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are floating, with long, slender stems that support the fruiting structures. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
