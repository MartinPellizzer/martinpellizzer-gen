It features small, aromatic leaves that are gray-green in color and emit a strong thyme scent when crushed. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its foliage is often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its essential oils and aromatic properties."
