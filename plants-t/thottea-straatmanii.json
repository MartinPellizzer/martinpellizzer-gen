    "intro": "Thottea straatmanii, commonly known as the Straatman's thottea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in areas with high altitudes and cool climates. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Thottea straatmanii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
