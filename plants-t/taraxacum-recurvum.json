    "intro": "Taraxacum recurvum, commonly known as the curlyleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, curly leaves that form a dense cluster near the ground. The plant produces a single, hollow, yellow flower head that develops into a white, spherical seed head with feathery seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Botanically, it is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower structure and wind-dispersed seeds."
