    "intro": "Trichilia quadrijuga, commonly known as the four-winged ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related species. The plant is characterized by its dense, hard wood and compound leaves with four pairs of leaflets. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, four-winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Due to its durability, the wood is valued for construction and furniture, though the species faces threats from overharvesting."
