    "intro": "Taraxacum leonardii, commonly known as the Leonard's dandelion, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces a basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed head. It is characterized by its ability to survive in arid conditions and has a deep taproot system for water storage. Taraxacum leonardii is also noted for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in herbal remedies."
