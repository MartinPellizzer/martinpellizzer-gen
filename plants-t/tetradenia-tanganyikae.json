    "intro": "Tetradenia tanganyikae, commonly known as the Tanganyikan tetradenia, is a unique plant native to the island of Unguja in Zanzibar. It is a small shrub characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fruiting bodies that contain several seeds. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
