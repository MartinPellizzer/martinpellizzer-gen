    "intro": "Taxus cuspidata f. minima, commonly known as the Japanese yew dwarf form, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features dense, needle-like foliage that is dark green and often retains its color year-round. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative hedge. The foliage has a subtle, aromatic scent when crushed, adding to its ornamental appeal."
