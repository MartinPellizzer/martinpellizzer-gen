    "intro": "Tillandsia pulchra var. amoenum, commonly known as the Purple-veined Air Plant, is a bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with purple or pink, giving it its distinctive appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and good air circulation. Its unique structure allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, making it well adapted to its natural habitat."
