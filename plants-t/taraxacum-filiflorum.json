    "intro": "Taraxacum filiflorum, commonly known as the slenderleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to regions of Europe and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its flowers develop into fluffy white seed heads, which are dispersed by the wind. Taraxacum filiflorum is typically low-growing, with a height ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters."
