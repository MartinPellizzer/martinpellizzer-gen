    "intro": "Tomoxis odorata, commonly known as the fragrant mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically red or yellow, which contain seeds dispersed by birds. It is native to regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
