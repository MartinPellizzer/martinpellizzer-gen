    "intro": "Trixis angustifolia var. latiuscula, commonly known as the narrowleaf trixis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a silvery-white underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom during the summer months. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with poor soil conditions. This variety is distinguished by its slightly broader leaves compared to the typical variety of Trixis angustifolia."
