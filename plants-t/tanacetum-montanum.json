    "intro": "Tanacetum montanum, commonly known as mountain tansy, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its aromatic, slightly bitter scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Tanacetum montanum is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
