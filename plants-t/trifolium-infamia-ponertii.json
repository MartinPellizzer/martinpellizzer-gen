    "intro": "Trifolium infamia-ponertii, commonly known as the rare Ponert's shamrock, is a lesser-known species within the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, typically consisting of three oval to heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It is native to specific regions in Central Europe and is often found in moist, shaded woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
