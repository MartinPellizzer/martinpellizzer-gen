It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and smooth, greyish bark. The tree produces clustered, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by large, round fruits with a thick, starchy pulp. The fruit is often used as a food source, similar to other members of the Treculia genus, and is valued for its nutritional content. It thrives in humid, lowland areas and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks."
