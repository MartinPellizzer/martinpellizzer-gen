    "intro": "Talinella, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline and sandy soils. Talinella species are characterized by their striking, often blue or purple, bract-like flowers that resemble holly leaves. They have a compact growth habit and are often used in coastal landscaping due to their hardiness. The genus includes several species, such as Talinella paniculata, which is native to southern Africa."
