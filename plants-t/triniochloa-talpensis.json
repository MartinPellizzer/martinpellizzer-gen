    "intro": "Triniochloa talpensis, commonly known as the mole grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, pale green blades that often form dense mats. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of a narrow spikelet that bears small, two-lobed flowers. Triniochloa talpensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
