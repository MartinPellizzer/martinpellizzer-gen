    "intro": "Thorella, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. Thorella species are typically shrubs or small trees, with lance-shaped leaves and a preference for well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially grown."
