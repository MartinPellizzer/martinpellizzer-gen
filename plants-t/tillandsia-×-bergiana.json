    "intro": "Tillandsia \u00d7 bergiana, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family. It thrives by attaching itself to trees and other structures, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air rather than soil. Its dense, hanging clusters of needle-like leaves create a unique, ethereal appearance in forest environments. The plant is native to the southeastern United States and parts of Latin America. It plays a vital ecological role by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
