    "intro": "Trichomanes carolianum, commonly known as the Carolian holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes. These trichomes help the plant retain moisture and reduce water loss in its moist, high-humidity habitat. Trichomanes carolianum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for when provided with the right conditions."
