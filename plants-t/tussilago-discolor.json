    "intro": "Tussilago discolor, commonly known as the purple marshweed, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, depending on the stage of bloom. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in moist environments. Tussilago discolor is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
