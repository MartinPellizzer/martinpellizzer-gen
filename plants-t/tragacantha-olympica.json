    "intro": "Tragacantha olympica, commonly known as the Olympic tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant produces a resinous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a food additive. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with mild winters. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
