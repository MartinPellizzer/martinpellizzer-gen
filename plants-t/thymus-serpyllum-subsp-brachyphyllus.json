    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum subsp. brachyphyllus, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features compact, creeping stems that form dense mats, often growing in rocky or limestone soils. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a strong, aromatic scent when crushed. Its small, pinkish-white flowers bloom in clusters during late spring to early summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary uses, similar to other thyme species."
