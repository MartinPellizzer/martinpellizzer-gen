    "intro": "Thalictrum thunbergii var. condensatum, commonly known as the dense meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in compound umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its graceful foliage and subtle floral display."
