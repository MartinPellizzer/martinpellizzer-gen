    "intro": "Thelypteris pyrrhorhachis subsp. laterepens, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds with a distinctive, broad, and leathery texture. The leaves are typically evergreen, with a dark green coloration and a slightly serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family."
