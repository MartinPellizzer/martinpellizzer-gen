    "intro": "Trichocereus strigosus, commonly known as the Peruvian torch cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems and a distinctive reddish or purplish coloration. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It is adapted to arid and high-altitude environments, with thick stems that store water. Trichocereus strigosus is also known for its potential psychoactive properties due to the presence of mescaline."
