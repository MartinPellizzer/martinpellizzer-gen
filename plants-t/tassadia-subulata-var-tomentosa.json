    "intro": "Tassadia subulata var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly tassadia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features dense, woolly silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which provide insulation and protection against harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
