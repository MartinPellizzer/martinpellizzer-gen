It is characterized by its reddish-brown bark, dark green needle-like leaves, and small, fleshy red berries. The plant is known for its longevity, with some specimens living over 2,000 years. Taxus coriacea contains taxine alkaloids, which are toxic to humans and animals. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
