    "intro": "Topobea barbata, commonly known as the hairy bristleplant, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically herbaceous growth habit. The plant features dense, hairy foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its botanical features make it well adapted to drought conditions and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
