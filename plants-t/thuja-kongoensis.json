    "intro": "Thuja kongoensis, commonly known as the African thuja, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the high altitudes of central and southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that are arranged in crossed pairs. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of conifers. Its slow growth rate and longevity make it a valuable species for ecological and conservation studies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment."
