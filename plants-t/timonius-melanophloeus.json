    "intro": "Timonius melanophloeus, commonly known as the black-bark timonius, is a unique member of the Timonieae tribe within the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark, which gives it its common name and distinguishes it from other species in the genus. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth surface and a dark green color, while its flowers are small and clustered. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
