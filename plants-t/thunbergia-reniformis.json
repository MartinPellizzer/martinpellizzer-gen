    "intro": "Thunbergia reniformis, commonly known as the heartleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant is a climbing vine with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports such as trellises or fences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and full sun to partial shade. Thunbergia reniformis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is popular in gardens and as a houseplant."
