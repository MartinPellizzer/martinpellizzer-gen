    "intro": "Timonius villamilii, commonly known as the Malagasy orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are often brightly colored, with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Timonius villamilii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
