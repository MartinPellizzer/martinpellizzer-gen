    "intro": "Tilia platyphyllos var. longepedunculata, commonly known as the long peduncled largeleaf linden, is a variety of the largeleaf linden native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often slightly serrated along the edges. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in early summer. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
