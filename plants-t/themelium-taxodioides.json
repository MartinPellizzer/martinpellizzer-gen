    "intro": "Themelium taxodioides, commonly known as the red-leafed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red foliage, which becomes more vibrant in the autumn season. The plant has alternate, palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its seasonal color changes."
