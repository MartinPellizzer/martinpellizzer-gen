    "intro": "Triticum cevallos, commonly known as wild wheat, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically has narrow, blade-like leaves and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its seeds are small and can be difficult to distinguish from other wheat species without close examination. Triticum cevallos is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to various environmental conditions."
