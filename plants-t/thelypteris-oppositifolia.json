    "intro": "Thelypteris oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaf fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to various regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and India. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arranged in a bipinnate pattern, with pinnae that are oppositely arranged on the rachis. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Thelypteris oppositifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
