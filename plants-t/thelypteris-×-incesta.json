    "intro": "Thelypteris \u00d7 incesta, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a fern species resulting from the cross between Thelypteris hydrophila and Thelypteris kunthii. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a dark green color and a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or near streams. Thelypteris \u00d7 incesta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
