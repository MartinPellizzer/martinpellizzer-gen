    "intro": "Triticum caninum subsp. alpestre, commonly known as the alpine dog wheat, is a perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, temperate climates. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences with small, pale green to brown florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it has a fibrous root system. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its adaptation to high-altitude environments."
