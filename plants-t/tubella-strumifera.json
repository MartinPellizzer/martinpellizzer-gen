    "intro": "Tubella strumifera, commonly known as the fluted tube sponge, is a unique marine sponge found in tropical and subtropical waters. It belongs to the family Halichondriidae and is characterized by its elongated, tubular body with a fluted appearance. The sponge's structure consists of a central axial canal surrounded by a series of concentric layers of spongin fibers. It lacks true pores and instead has a porous surface that allows for water flow. This species is known for its ability to filter large volumes of water, contributing to its ecological role in marine ecosystems."
