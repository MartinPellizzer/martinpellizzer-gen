    "intro": "Thymus loevyanus var. serpens, commonly known as serpent's thyme, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered with fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in sunny, dry habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
