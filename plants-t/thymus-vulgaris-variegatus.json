    "intro": "Thymus vulgaris variegatus, commonly known as the variegated thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features aromatic, narrow leaves with distinctive variegation of green and white or silver, which enhances its ornamental value. The plant produces small, pink or lavender flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its essential oils, like thymol, are valued in both culinary and medicinal applications."
