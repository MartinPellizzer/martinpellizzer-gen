    "intro": "Thuja quadrangularis, commonly known as the Chinese thuja or golden thread, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to China. It is characterized by its narrow, cylindrical shape and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that are often a bright yellow-green color. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically red or orange when mature. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to tolerate urban environments and air pollution."
