It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers. Its botanical features include sturdy, rigid stems and a compact growth habit. It is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native environment."
