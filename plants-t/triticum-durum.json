    "intro": "Triticum durum, commonly known as durum wheat, is a species of wheat that is botanically characterized by its hard, amber-colored grains. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is native to the Mediterranean region. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stalks and spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and parallel-veined, and the flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes. Durum wheat is particularly noted for its high gluten content, which makes it ideal for producing semolina used in pasta and couscous."
