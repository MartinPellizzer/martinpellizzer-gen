    "intro": "Toxicodendron caudatum, commonly known as the silky dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red or orange berries that are attractive to birds but are toxic to humans and livestock. Its leaves are opposite and have a distinctive, finely toothed margin. Toxicodendron caudatum is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
