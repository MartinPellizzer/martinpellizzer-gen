    "intro": "Trifolium arvense var. cyrenaicum, commonly known as the Crete clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval to lanceolate leaflets arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and for erosion control."
