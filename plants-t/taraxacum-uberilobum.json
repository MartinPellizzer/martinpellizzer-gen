    "intro": "Taraxacum uberilobum, commonly known as the woolly dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, fuzzy, and often gray-green leaves. The plant produces a tall, hollow stem topped with a single, spherical inflorescence composed of numerous small, yellow flowers. After flowering, it develops a distinctive, elongated seed head with white, feathery seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. This species is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine meadows."
