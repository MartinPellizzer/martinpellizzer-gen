    "intro": "Trochostigma repandum, commonly known as the wandering bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
