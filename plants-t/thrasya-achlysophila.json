    "intro": "Thrasya achlysophila, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has no leaves, relying instead on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are pale green or white, with a distinctive, almost translucent appearance. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
