    "intro": "Triticum repens var. arenosum, commonly known as sandgrass or beach grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal areas of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, saline soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is well adapted to harsh coastal environments, tolerating salt spray, wind, and poor soil conditions. This variety plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines."
