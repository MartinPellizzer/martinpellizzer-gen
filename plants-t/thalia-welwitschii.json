    "intro": "Thalia welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia plant, is a unique species native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola. It is characterized by its two large, strap-like leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a thick, woody trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Thalia welwitschii produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is pollinated by insects. It is considered a living fossil, with a lineage dating back over 100 million years."
