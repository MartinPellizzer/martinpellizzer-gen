    "intro": "Triticum sphaerococcum var. pseudoalbopubescens, commonly known as the silver-haired wheatgrass, is a rare and unique variety of wheatgrass characterized by its distinctive silvery pubescence. It is a low-growing perennial grass with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant is native to certain regions of Central Asia and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a compact growth habit that helps it conserve water. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
