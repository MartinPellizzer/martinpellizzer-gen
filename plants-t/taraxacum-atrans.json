    "intro": "Taraxacum atrans, commonly known as the pale dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem that supports its flower head, which eventually develops into a white, fluffy seed head. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its botanical features make it easily distinguishable from other dandelion species."
