    "intro": "Trichipteris ursina, commonly known as the bear's foot fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, broad, leathery fronds that resemble a bear's footprint. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. Trichipteris ursina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
