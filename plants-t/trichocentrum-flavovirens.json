    "intro": "Trichocentrum flavovirens, commonly known as the golden-green orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.

The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a subtle yellowish or golden hue, giving it its common name. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive fragrance, and they bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Trichocentrum flavovirens requires well-draining potting mix and consistent moisture to flourish."
