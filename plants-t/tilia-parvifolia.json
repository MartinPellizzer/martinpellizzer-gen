    "intro": "Tilia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved linden, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are smaller and more pointed compared to other linden species. The tree produces fragrant, pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The small-leaved linden is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
