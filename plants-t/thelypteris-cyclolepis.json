    "intro": "Thelypteris cyclolepis, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are often lobed and have a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Thelypteris cyclolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
