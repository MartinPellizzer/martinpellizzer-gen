    "intro": "Triumfetta salzmannii, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red sandal tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree with opposite, elliptic leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. Its roots are known for their medicinal properties, and the wood is valued for its durability and reddish color. Triumfetta salzmannii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or dry woodland habitats."
