    "intro": "Tanacetum macrophyllum f. angustiloba, commonly known as narrow-leaved tansy, is a horticultural form of the tansy plant. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and yellow flower heads that resemble those of its parent species. The plant is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in temperate regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens. Due to its similarity to other members of the genus, it requires careful identification to avoid confusion with potentially toxic species."
