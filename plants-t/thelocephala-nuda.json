    "intro": "Thelocephala nuda, commonly known as the naked head lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, pale to dark grey thallus that lacks distinct lobes or rhizines. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It typically grows on bark, stone, or wood in temperate and boreal forest regions. Thelocephala nuda is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants."
