    "intro": "Trifolium pratense var. maritimum, commonly known as sea clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments due to its tolerance for salt spray and wind. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various insects. Sea clover is also used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
