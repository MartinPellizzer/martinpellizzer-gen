    "intro": "Thelypteris berroi, commonly known as the Berro's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Thelypteris berroi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
