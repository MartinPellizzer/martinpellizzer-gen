    "intro": "Telipogon karsteae, commonly known as the karst lichen, is a rare and specialized plant that thrives in karst environments characterized by limestone rock formations. It is a lichen, a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. This plant is adapted to grow on rock surfaces, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its unique morphology includes a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to the substrate. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Telipogon karsteae is often found in secluded, humid microclimates within karst landscapes."
