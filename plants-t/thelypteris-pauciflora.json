    "intro": "Thelypteris pauciflora, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered spores on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are typically found in shaded, moist environments. Thelypteris pauciflora is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in shaded areas."
