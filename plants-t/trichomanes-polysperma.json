    "intro": "Trichomanes polysperma, commonly known as the common huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its simple, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is evergreen and can be found growing in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Trichomanes polysperma is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its use in traditional medicine in some cultures."
