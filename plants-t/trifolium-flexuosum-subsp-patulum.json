    "intro": "Trifolium flexuosum subsp. patulum, commonly known as the creeping clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically pale green with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
