    "intro": "Trichomanes crispum f. genuina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are often curled or crisped at the edges. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in rocky or forested areas with high humidity. Its small, delicate sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
