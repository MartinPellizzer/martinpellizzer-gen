    "intro": "Taraxacum latimarginatum, commonly known as the broad-margin dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, broad leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a hollow, wind-dispersed seed stem topped with a spherical seed head, known as a pappus. It thrives in temperate regions and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Taraxacum latimarginatum is a perennial herb that plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators."
