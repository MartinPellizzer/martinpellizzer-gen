It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has thorny stems and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. The fruit is a small capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
