    "intro": "Thesium lopollense, commonly known as the coastal thesium, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to withstand salty sea air and periodic drought. Thesium lopollense plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is an important species in local ecosystems."
