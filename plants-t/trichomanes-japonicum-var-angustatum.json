    "intro": "Trichomanes japonicum var. angustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family with distinctive, delicate fronds. It features finely divided, linear leaves that are typically bright green and slightly curled, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant is native to parts of East Asia, including Japan, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The fronds are often used in traditional Japanese horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
