    "intro": "Tragacantha arganatica, commonly known as argan tree, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the arid regions of North Africa, particularly Morocco, where it thrives in dry, rocky soils. The tree is characterized by its deep root system, which allows it to survive in harsh, semi-desert environments. Its fruit pods contain a valuable oil, derived from the seeds, which is used in traditional medicine and cosmetics. The plant also plays an important ecological role in preventing soil erosion and supporting local biodiversity."
