    "intro": "Thesium durum, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions due to its deep root system. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Thesium durum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
