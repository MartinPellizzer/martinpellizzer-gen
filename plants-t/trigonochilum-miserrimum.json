    "intro": "Trigonochilum miserrimum, commonly known as the weeping orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, drooping flowers that resemble weeping tendrils, giving it its common name. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
