    "intro": "Tococa grandifolia, commonly known as the Amazonian coffee plant, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like fruits containing aromatic seeds. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to thrive in the humid, shaded understory of the rainforest. Tococa grandifolia is valued not only for its potential as a coffee substitute but also for its medicinal properties."
