    "intro": "Trithrinax schizophylla var. schizophylla, commonly known as the Schizophylla palm, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean, particularly found in parts of Cuba and the Bahamas. It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and pinnate leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, spiny fruits containing dark purple seeds. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and well-drained soils. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
