    "intro": "Taraxacum pectinosum, commonly known as the hairy dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, elongated flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, parachute-like seed with a white pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Taraxacum pectinosum is a perennial herb that thrives in temperate climates and is known for its medicinal properties."
