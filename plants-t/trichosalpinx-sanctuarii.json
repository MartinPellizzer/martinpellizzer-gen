    "intro": "Trichosalpinx sanctuarii, commonly known as the sacred flame orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. Native to the misty cloud forests of Central America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. Its most distinctive feature is its vibrant red and orange floral display, which resembles a flickering flame. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are pollinated by specific species of bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
