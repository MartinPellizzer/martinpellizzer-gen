    "intro": "Tricholaena vestita, commonly known as the silky tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant has a fibrous, spongy trunk that is often used in traditional crafts and construction. Its rhizome system allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in rainforests. The fronds are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color underneath, contributing to its ornamental value."
