    "intro": "Tectaria poilanei, commonly known as the Poliane shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically leathery and can grow quite large, making it a striking addition to botanical gardens. The spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are an important feature for identification."
