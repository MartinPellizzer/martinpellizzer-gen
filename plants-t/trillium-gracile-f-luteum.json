    "intro": "Trillium gracile f. luteum, commonly known as the yellow starflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Trilliaceae family and is characterized by its three narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a single, showy yellow flower that blooms in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soils. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees, and it produces red berries that are dispersed by birds. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas."
