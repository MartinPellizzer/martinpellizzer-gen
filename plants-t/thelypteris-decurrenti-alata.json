    "intro": "Thelypteris decurrenti-alata, commonly known as the spreading foot fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive, broad, feather-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. Thelypteris decurrenti-alata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
