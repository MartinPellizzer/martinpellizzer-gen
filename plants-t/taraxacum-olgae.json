    "intro": "Taraxacum olgae, commonly known as the Olgae dandelion, is a flowering plant species belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, yellowish stem that supports a single, showy flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Taraxacum olgae is a perennial herb that plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators."
