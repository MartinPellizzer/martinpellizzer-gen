    "intro": "Triticum quadratum, commonly known as the four-row barley, is a species of grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of four rows of grains along the rachis. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, each containing two to three florets. Triticum quadratum is primarily cultivated for its grains, which are used in traditional brewing and as a forage crop."
