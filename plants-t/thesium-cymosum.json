It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cymes, giving it its scientific name. Thesium cymosum is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
