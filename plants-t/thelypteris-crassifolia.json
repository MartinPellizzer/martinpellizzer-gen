    "intro": "Thelypteris crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are often deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. The fronds are typically arranged in a compact, upright cluster, with the fertile spore-bearing structures (sori) located on the underside of the leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices, and it has a rhizomatous growth habit that allows it to spread vegetatively. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in humid climates."
