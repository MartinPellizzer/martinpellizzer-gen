    "intro": "Tephrocactus turpinii, commonly known as the Turpin's cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Baja California, Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed structure and typically features a single, short stem. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered at the top of the stem. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Tephrocactus turpinii is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
