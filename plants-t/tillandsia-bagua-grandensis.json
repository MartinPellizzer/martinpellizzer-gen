    "intro": "Tillandsia bagua-grandensis, commonly known as the eight-angled air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with vivid purple or red flowers. Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
