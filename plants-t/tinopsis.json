    "intro": "Tinopsis, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, deciduous leaves that often have a silvery or grayish appearance due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, with colors ranging from white to pale pink. Tinopsis species are native to various regions in Africa and are often found in arid or semi-arid environments. These plants are adapted to thrive in poor soils and can be drought-tolerant, making them suitable for xeriscaping in certain climates."
