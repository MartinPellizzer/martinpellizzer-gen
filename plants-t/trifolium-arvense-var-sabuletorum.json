    "intro": "Trifolium arvense var. sabuletorum, commonly known as the sandy clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides, grasslands, and disturbed areas. The plant features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, with a slightly hairy surface. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are borne in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. Trifolium arvense var. sabuletorum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
