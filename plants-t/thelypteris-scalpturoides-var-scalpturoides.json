    "intro": "Thelypteris scalpturoides var. scalpturoides, commonly known as the scarlet wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, bright red to orange fronds that are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of brownish spores. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often curled at the tips. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
