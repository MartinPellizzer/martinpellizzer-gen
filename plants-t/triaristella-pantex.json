    "intro": "Triaristella pantex, commonly known as the Pantex starwort, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or dune environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, while its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a star-like pattern. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Triaristella pantex is considered a vulnerable species."
