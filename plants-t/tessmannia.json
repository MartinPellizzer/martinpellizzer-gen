    "intro": "Tessmannia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed tea tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to southeastern Australia, where it typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plants are shrubs or small trees, often with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers. Tessmannia species are valued for their aromatic oils, which are used in essential oils and traditional medicine. They play an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators."
