    "intro": "Trifolium tomentosum var. lanatum, commonly known as the woolly clover, is a variant of the common clover species characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. It is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in spherical heads, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets covered in a soft, woolly texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
