    "intro": "Taraxacum distinctilobum, commonly known as the distinct lobed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a distinctive, elongated stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray florets and disc florets, which develop into a crown of white petals and then into the familiar seed parachutes. This plant is typically found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
