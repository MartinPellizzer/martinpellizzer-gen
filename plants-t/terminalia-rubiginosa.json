    "intro": "Terminalia rubiginosa, commonly known as African ebony, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by small, red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture, while its bark is thick and fissured. Terminalia rubiginosa plays an important role in local ecosystems and is often used in traditional medicine."
