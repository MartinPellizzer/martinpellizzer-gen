    "intro": "Tilia communis, commonly known as the small-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically smaller than those of its close relative, Tilia cordata. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. The wood is light, soft, and easy to work with, making it valuable for carpentry and furniture making."
