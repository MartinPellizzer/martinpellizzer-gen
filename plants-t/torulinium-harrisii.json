    "intro": "Torulinium harrisii, commonly known as the Harris's torula, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its bulbs are adapted to store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Torulinium harrisii is considered a vulnerable species."
