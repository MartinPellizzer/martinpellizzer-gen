    "intro": "Timonius stenolobus, commonly known as the narrow-lobed timonius, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, temperate climates, often found in woodland or meadow environments. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often hairy, and its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in compound umbels. Timonius stenolobus is known for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used in traditional herbal remedies. However, it is relatively rare and may be considered a threatened species in some regions due to habitat loss."
