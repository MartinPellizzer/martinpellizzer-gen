    "intro": "Taraxacum grossodentosum, commonly known as the giant toothed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped basal leaves with prominent, tooth-like lobes. The plant produces a single, tall, hollow stem topped with a spherical seed head that disperses seeds via the wind. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in meadows and grasslands. Due to its distinctive morphology, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
