    "intro": "Timonius roemeri, commonly known as the mountain hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by herbivores and is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
