It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, colorful inflorescences that consist of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
