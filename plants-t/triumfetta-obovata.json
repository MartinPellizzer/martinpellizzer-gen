    "intro": "Triumfetta obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate triumfetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, round, red or orange fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. The species is noted for its adaptability and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
