    "intro": "Tetracellion, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers, which are typically tubular and arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. The plants are native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean, thriving in saline and sandy soils. Tetracellion species are often found in maritime environments, where they tolerate salt spray and strong winds. Their botanical features make them valuable in coastal landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
