    "intro": "Theodora stipulata, commonly known as the stipule orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant features strap-like leaves and possesses specialized structures called pseudobulbs, which help store water and nutrients. Its unique floral morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study. Theodora stipulata is often found in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests and cloud forests."
