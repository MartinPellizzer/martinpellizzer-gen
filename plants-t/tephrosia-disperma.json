    "intro": "Tephrosia disperma, commonly known as the spreading tephrosia, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, sprawling growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. Tephrosia disperma has small, oblong seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its wide distribution. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade."
