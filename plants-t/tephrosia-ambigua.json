It is a legume belonging to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy blue or purple flowers. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod and are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant also plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
