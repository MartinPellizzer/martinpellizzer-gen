    "intro": "Triticum caucasicum, commonly known as Caucasian wheat, is a wild relative of cultivated wheat species. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, including parts of Turkey, Georgia, and Armenia. This plant is characterized by its slender stems and spike-like inflorescence, which bears small, awned grains. It typically grows in rocky or semi-arid environments and is adapted to cooler climates. Its genetic diversity makes it an important resource for breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience and yield."
