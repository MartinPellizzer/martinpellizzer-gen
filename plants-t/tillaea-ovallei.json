    "intro": "Tillaea ovallei, commonly known as the ovalleaf tillaea, is a rare and endemic succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is characterized by its fleshy leaves and adaptations to arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a compact, cushion-like growth form. Its leaves are thick and oval-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white wax to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tillaea ovallei is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
