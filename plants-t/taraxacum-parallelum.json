    "intro": "Taraxacum parallelum, commonly known as the parallel-leaf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, parallel-veined leaves and a flowering head that produces a cluster of fluffy seeds. Native to Europe, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has a taproot system and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its yellow flowers bloom in the spring and early summer, followed by the characteristic seed heads that are easily dispersed by the wind."
