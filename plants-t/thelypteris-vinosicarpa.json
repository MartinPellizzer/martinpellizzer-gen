    "intro": "Thelypteris vinosicarpa, commonly known as the purple-fruited shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often tinged with a reddish or purplish hue, especially on the undersides. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris vinosicarpa typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in tropical and subtropical regions."
