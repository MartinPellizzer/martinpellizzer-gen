    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudodissectum, commonly known as the dissected dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often finely divided, giving it a feathery appearance. Its flowers are yellow and form a composite head, which develops into a fluffy white pappus for wind dispersal of seeds. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates."
