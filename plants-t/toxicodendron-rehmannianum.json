    "intro": "Toxicodendron rehmannianum, commonly known as the lacquer tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by distinctive, spiky fruits called samaras. It is known for its ability to produce a toxic sap that can cause dermatitis in humans upon contact. The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in the production of high-quality lacquer."
