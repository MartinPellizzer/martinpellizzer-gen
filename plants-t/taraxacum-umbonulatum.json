It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are usually hairy and lanceolate in shape. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring, followed by the characteristic seed heads that produce wind-dispersed seeds.
