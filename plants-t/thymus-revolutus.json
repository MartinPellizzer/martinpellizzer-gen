    "intro": "Thymus revolutus, commonly known as the rolled thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It is closely related to other thyme species and is often used in culinary and medicinal applications. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover."
