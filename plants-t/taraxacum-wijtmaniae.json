    "intro": "Taraxacum wijtmaniae, commonly known as the Wijtman's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a capsule containing numerous seeds, each equipped with a pappus for wind dispersal. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. Its botanical features make it a unique and relatively rare member of the dandelion genus."
