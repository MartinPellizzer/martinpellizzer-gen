    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 applii, commonly known as the hybrid thyme, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Thymus praecox and Thymus serpyllum, resulting in a plant with a compact, mat-forming growth habit. The leaves are small, ovate, and aromatic, with a dense covering of fine hairs, typical of the thyme genus. It produces small, pale pink to lavender flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
