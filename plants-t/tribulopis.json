    "intro": "Tribulopis, commonly known as the African burr or tribulus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Zygophyllaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their spiny stems and compound leaves. They produce small, yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, three-lobed fruits that often have hooked bracts. These bracts aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing, a feature common in many burr plants."
