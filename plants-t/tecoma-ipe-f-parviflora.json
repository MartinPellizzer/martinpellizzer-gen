It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange tubular flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant flowers and drought tolerance."
