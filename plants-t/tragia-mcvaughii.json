    "intro": "Tragia mcvaughii, commonly known as the desert thistle, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, glandular leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and heat. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss through transpiration. Tragia mcvaughii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed soils."
