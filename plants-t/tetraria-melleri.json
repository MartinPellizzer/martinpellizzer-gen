    "intro": "Tetraria melleri, commonly known as the horned lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like projections on its thallus. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide photosynthetic energy. It is often found on tree bark and rocks in temperate regions. Its slow growth and unique morphology make it a notable species in ecological studies."
