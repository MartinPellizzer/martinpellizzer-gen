    "intro": "Tetramolopium carstenszense, commonly known as the Carstens Island ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its erect, sparsely hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typical of the genus Tetramolopium. It thrives in coastal and rocky habitats, often growing in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
