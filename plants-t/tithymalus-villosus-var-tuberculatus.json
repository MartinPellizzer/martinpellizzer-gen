    "intro": "Tithymalus villosus var. tuberculatus, commonly known as the hairy tithymalus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It features hairy, glandular leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers partial shade and consistent moisture."
