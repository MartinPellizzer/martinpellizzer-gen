It is characterized by its fine, slender blades and a dense, clump-forming growth habit. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often dark green and have a slightly hairy texture. Trisetum umbrosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
