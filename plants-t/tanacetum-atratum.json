The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and prefers moist, well-drained soils in partial shade. Its foliage has a strong, aromatic scent, and it is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Tanacetum atratum is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
