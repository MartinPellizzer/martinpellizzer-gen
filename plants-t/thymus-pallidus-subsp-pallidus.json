    "intro": "Thymus pallidus subsp. pallidus, commonly known as pale thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features aromatic, gray-green foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in dense clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, contribute to its use in herbal medicine and as a culinary herb."
