    "intro": "Toxicodendron radicans var. verrucosum, commonly known as the Southern pokeweed, is a variant of the poison ivy plant characterized by its distinctive, warty, and often clustered growth pattern. It is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in moist, disturbed soils, such as those found in woodland edges and along roadsides. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and can grow as a shrub or vine, reaching heights of up to 6 feet. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels, followed by dark purple berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Like other members of the Toxicodendron genus, it contains urushiol, a potent allergen that can cause severe skin irritation upon contact."
