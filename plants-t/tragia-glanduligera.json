    "intro": "Tragia glanduligera, commonly known as the glandular tragia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Tragia glanduligera is known for its glandular structures on its stems and leaves, which secrete a sticky substance. It is often found in dry, disturbed habitats and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
