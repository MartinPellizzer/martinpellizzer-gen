It features a conical shape with dense, scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath. The plant produces small, reddish-brown berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Taxus microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens and landscapes. It also contains taxol, a compound with potential anti-cancer properties."
