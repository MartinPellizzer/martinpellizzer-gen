    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. variegatus, commonly known as variegated thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features fragrant, small, green and white-variegated leaves that emit a strong, minty aroma. The plant produces pink or purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal color contrast."
