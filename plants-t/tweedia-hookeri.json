    "intro": "Tweedia hookeri, commonly known as the Cape snowflake, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its striking white or pale blue flowers that resemble snowflakes. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late winter or early spring. Tweedia hookeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand coastal conditions."
