It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Thelypteris jijiangensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
