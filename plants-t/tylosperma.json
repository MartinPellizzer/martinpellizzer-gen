    "intro": "Tylosperma, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to various regions in Africa, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants are characterized by their woody stems and compound leaves, which help them survive in harsh conditions. Tylosperma species produce small, yellow or white flowers, followed by legume-like fruits containing seeds. These plants are often used in traditional medicine and have ecological importance in their native habitats."
