    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. vinealis, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically gray-green in color and emit a strong thyme scent when crushed. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its creeping growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it ideal for ground cover in gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental and aromatic qualities."
