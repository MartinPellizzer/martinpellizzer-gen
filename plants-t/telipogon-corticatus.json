    "intro": "Telipogon corticatus, commonly known as the bark lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It forms a thin, crust-like layer on tree bark, rocks, and soil surfaces. The thallus is typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. It lacks distinct lobes but may have a slightly irregular margin. This lichen is often found in temperate forests and is an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
