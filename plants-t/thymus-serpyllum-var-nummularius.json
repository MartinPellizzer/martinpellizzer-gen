    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. nummularius, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color, and its flowers are usually pink or purple, blooming in early summer. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, which makes it well-suited for ground cover. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant. Its aromatic leaves and flowers also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
