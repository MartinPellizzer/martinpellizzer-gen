    "intro": "Thelypteris banaensis, commonly known as the Bana fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, spongy layer of roots, which helps in water absorption. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a lush green appearance throughout the year."
