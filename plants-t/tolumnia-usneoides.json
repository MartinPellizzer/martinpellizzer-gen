    "intro": "Tolumnia usneoides, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems and small, scale-like leaves that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant is known for its ability to absorb moisture from the air, making it well adapted to its natural habitat. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked. Tolumnia usneoides is often found growing on trees in tropical and subtropical regions."
