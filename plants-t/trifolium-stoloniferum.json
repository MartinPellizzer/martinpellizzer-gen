    "intro": "Trifolium stoloniferum, commonly known as the creeping clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant spreads via stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. Trifolium stoloniferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
