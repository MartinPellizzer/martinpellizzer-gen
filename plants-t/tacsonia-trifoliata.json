    "intro": "Tacsonia trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in a short inflorescence. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Tacsonia trifoliata is often found in alpine meadows and is a hardy perennial species."
