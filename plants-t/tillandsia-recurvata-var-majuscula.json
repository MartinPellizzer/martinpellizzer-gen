    "intro": "Tillandsia recurvata var. majuscula, commonly known as the giant air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, arching leaves that can grow up to several feet in length, forming a rosette structure that traps moisture and nutrients. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves rather than roots. It thrives in humid, bright indirect light conditions and requires regular misting or soaking to maintain its health. This variety is prized for its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
