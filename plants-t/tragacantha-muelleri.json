    "intro": "Tragacantha muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Tragacantha muelleri is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Its habitat includes sandy soils and rocky areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife."
