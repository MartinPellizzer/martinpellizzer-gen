    "intro": "Thymus paucifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which contribute to its distinctive texture. The plant produces tiny, pink to purple flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its compact size and fragrant foliage, it is often used in culinary and ornamental applications."
