    "intro": "Taraxacum hastatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, elongated leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a distinctive pappus-based seed sphere. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is known for its taproot system and its ability to produce a large number of lightweight seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is often considered a weed but also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
