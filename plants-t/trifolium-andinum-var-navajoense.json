    "intro": "Trifolium andinum var. navajoense, commonly known as Navajo Mountain clover, is a perennial herb native to the high elevations of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, typically along the edges of meadows and rocky slopes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
