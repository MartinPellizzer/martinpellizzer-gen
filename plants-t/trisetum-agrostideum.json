    "intro": "Trisetum agrostideum, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, rough to the touch, and often have a bluish-green color. Trisetum agrostideum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
