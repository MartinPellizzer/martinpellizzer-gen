    "intro": "Tomex pubescens, commonly known as the hairy tomex, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name and help in reducing water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tomex pubescens is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in semi-arid climates."
