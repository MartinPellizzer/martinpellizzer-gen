    "intro": "Trichantha incarnata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth rate, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
