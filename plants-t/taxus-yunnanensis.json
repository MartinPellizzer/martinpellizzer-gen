    "intro": "Taxus yunnanensis, commonly known as Yunnan yew, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to China. It belongs to the family Taxaceae and is characterized by its slow growth and long lifespan, often reaching over 1,000 years. The plant has distinctive dark green, scale-like leaves and produces red, berry-like cones that contain toxic seeds. It is notable for containing taxine alkaloids, which have significant medicinal properties. Due to its ecological importance and conservation status, it is protected in many regions."
