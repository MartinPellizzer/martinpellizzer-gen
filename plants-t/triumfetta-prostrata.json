    "intro": "Triumfetta prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate triumfetta, is a flowering plant native to Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically spreads along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, often blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. Triumfetta prostrata is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued as a ground cover in landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
