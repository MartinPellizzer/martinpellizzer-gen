    "intro": "Taraxacum cymbifolium, commonly known as the Japanese dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to East Asia, particularly Japan, and is characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem topped with a cluster of yellow flowers that eventually develop into white, fluffy seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in gardens and woodland edges. Taraxacum cymbifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and floral display."
