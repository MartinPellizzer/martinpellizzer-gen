It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in dense clusters, typically in the spring. Red clover is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in agricultural settings. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides."
