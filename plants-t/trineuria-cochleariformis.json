It belongs to the family Lichenes, and is characterized by its intricate, curling thallus that resembles a spiral staircase. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is typically found on tree bark and rocks in temperate regions. Due to its specialized morphology, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat."
