    "intro": "Tephrocactus glomeratus var. atratispinus, commonly known as the black-spined cluster cactus, is a compact, spiny cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, dark brown to black spines. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
