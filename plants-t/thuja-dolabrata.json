    "intro": "Thuja dolabrata, commonly known as the Chinese thuja, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its flattened, scale-like leaves that are arranged in dense, flat sprays. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, typical of the Cupressaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Thuja dolabrata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, compact growth."
