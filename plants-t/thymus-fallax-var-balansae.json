    "intro": "Thymus fallax var. balansae, commonly known as Balansae thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features compact, woody stems covered in dense, grayish-blue foliage that is aromatic and fuzzy to the touch. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun exposure. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
