    "intro": "Triticum persoonianum, commonly known as Persian wheat, is a species of wild grass native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, each containing a single grain. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. While not cultivated for grain production, it is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic relationship to domesticated wheat species."
