    "intro": "Trifolium lupinaster subsp. pacificum, commonly known as Pacific clover, is a perennial herb native to the western regions of North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets with a serrated edge. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and along riverbanks. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
