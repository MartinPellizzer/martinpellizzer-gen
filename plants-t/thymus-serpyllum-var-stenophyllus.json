    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. stenophyllus, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and closely spaced along the stems. The plant produces tiny, pink to lavender flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often used in culinary applications due to its pungent, aromatic properties. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry, sunny conditions."
