The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and small, spurred flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed soils. Tragia stolziana is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
