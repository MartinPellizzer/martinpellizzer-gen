    "intro": "Tanacetum czerniakowskae, commonly known as the Czerniakowska's tansy, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a strong, camphor-like scent, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
