    "intro": "Timonius diffusus, commonly known as the spreading timonius, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Timonieae tribe. It is characterized by its elongated, trailing stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The flowers are typically pale green to white, with a subtle fragrance, and are clustered in loose, terminal inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forests or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
