    "intro": "Taraxacum zineralum, commonly known as the Zineralum dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers and heart-shaped basal leaves. The plant is native to specific regions in Central Asia and is often found in grassy habitats. It produces a distinctive seed head that releases lightweight seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the dandelion genus."
