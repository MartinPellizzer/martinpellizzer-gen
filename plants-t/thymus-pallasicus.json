    "intro": "Thymus pallasicus, commonly known as the Balkan thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, needle-like leaves and clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sunlight, making it well adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, which contribute to its medicinal and culinary uses. Thymus pallasicus is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and its role in traditional herbal medicine."
