    "intro": "Thelypteris limbosperma, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to various regions of the Americas. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated fronds that are usually dark green and persist for several years. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris limbosperma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
