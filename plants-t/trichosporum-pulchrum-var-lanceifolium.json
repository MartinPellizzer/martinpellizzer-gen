    "intro": "Trichosporum pulchrum var. lanceifolium, commonly known as the lanceleaf trichosporum, is a perennial plant characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and compact growth habit. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
