It is characterized by its tiny size, typically measuring less than 5 millimeters in length. This species is often found on the leaves of various plants, where it feeds on plant sap using its specialized mouthparts. Its life cycle includes egg, nymph, and adult stages, with the nymphs resembling the adults but lacking fully developed wings. The plant's botanical features, such as leaf structure and sap composition, play a crucial role in the insect's survival and feeding habits."
