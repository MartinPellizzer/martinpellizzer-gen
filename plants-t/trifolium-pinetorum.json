    "intro": "Trifolium pinetorum, commonly known as the pine clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. Trifolium pinetorum thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories or along woodland edges. It is a valuable forage plant for livestock and also supports a variety of pollinators."
