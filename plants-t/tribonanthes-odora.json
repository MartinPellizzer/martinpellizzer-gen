    "intro": "Tribonanthes odora, commonly known as the fragrant nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but should be consumed with caution due to the presence of toxic compounds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant's botanical features reflect adaptations to its arid and semi-arid habitats, with a focus on nocturnal pollination and efficient water use."
