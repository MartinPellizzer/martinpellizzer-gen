    "intro": "Tectaria kunzei, commonly known as the broad-leafed tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky areas, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, protective layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow under certain conditions, which is a unique botanical feature of this species."
