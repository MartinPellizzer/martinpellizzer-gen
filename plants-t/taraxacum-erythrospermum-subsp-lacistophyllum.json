    "intro": "Taraxacum erythrospermum subsp. lacistophyllum, commonly known as the red-seed dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, bright yellow composite flower head. The plant produces small, reddish-brown seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
