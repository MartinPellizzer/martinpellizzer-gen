    "intro": "Thelypteris struthiopteroides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, brown hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky, acidic soils and thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, elongated shape that distinguishes it from other fern species. Thelypteris struthiopteroides plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
