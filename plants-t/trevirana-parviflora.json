    "intro": "Trevirana parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered trevirana, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pale pink to white, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
