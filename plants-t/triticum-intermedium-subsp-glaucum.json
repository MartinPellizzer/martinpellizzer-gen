    "intro": "Triticum intermedium subsp. glaucum, commonly known as intermediate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that often have a waxy coating. The plant produces panicles of spikelets, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for marginal lands. This species is also valued for its potential in forage and as a cover crop due to its hardiness and ecological benefits."
