    "intro": "Trichosalpinx patula, commonly known as the purple ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. This epiphytic plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its modified stems for photosynthesis. Its flowers are characterized by their vibrant purple color and intricate, delicate structure. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
