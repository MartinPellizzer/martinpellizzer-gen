    "intro": "Tectaria vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant is notable for its unique reproductive method, as it produces live offspring through a process called viviparity. Tectaria vivipara typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological study."
