    "intro": "Thymus boeoticus, commonly known as Greek thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its antimicrobial properties. Thymus boeoticus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and borders."
