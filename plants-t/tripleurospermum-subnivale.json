    "intro": "Tripleurospermum subnivale, commonly known as the snow buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of high-altitude ecosystems."
