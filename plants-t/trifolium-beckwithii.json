    "intro": "Trifolium beckwithii, commonly known as Beckwith's clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
