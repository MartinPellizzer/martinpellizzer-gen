    "intro": "Tradescantia latifolia, commonly known as the spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of showy, three-petaled flowers that bloom in shades of violet, pink, or white. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. It is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in shaded forest understories. Tradescantia latifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a common garden plant."
