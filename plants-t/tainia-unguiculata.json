    "intro": "Tainia unguiculata, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its showy, orange-yellow flowers that resemble trumpets, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves and a rapid growth rate, making it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Tainia unguiculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can also be used in traditional medicine."
