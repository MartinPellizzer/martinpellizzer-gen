    "intro": "Triticum pubiflorum, commonly known as the pubescent-flowered wheat, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy inflorescence and small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a compact growth habit. While not widely cultivated for grain production, it is of interest to botanists and researchers studying wild wheat species."
