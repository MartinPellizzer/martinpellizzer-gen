    "intro": "Taraxacum eriophorum, commonly known as the woolly dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a distinctive, fluffy seed head with parachute-like seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in harsh conditions."
