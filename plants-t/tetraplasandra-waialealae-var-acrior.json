    "intro": "Tetraplasandra waialealae var. acrior, commonly known as the Waialeale acrior hibiscus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Hawaii. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant has palm-like leaves that are large and waxy, adapted to the humid and tropical climate of its native habitat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
