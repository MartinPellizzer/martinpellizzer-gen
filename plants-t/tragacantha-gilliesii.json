    "intro": "Tragacantha gilliesii, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert scrublands. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
