    "intro": "Tabernaemontana amygdalifolia var. glaucophylla, commonly known as the Glaucophylla star of Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has lance-shaped, glossy green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variant is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
