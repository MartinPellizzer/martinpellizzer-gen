    "intro": "Tristellateia madagascariensis var. heterophylla, commonly known as the Madagascar starleaf, is a unique plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped leaves that vary in size and shape across different parts of the plant. The leaves are usually opposite or alternate, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its native environment. This variant is notable for its morphological variation, which makes it an interesting subject for botanical study. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas and is often found in humid forests."
