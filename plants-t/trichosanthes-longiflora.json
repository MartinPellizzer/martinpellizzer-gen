    "intro": "Trichosanthes longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered snake gourd, is a climbing vine native to southern Asia. It produces large, yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that are often used in traditional medicine and cooking. The plant has a distinct, rough, hairy stem and heart-shaped leaves with a pointed tip. Its fruit is a long, slender, green gourd that turns orange when mature. The botanical features of Trichosanthes longiflora make it both ornamental and economically valuable in its native regions."
