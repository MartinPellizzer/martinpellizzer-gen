The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its common name. This variety is often found in moist, woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental qualities in native plant gardens."
