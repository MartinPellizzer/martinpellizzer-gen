    "intro": "Trichomanes aureum, commonly known as the golden huperzia, is a type of fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its small, strap-like leaves that are often covered in fine, golden hairs, giving it its common name. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Trichomanes aureum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
