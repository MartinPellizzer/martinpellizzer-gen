    "intro": "Tabebuia stenocalyx, commonly known as the white flame tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The tree has a straight trunk with smooth, gray bark and produces small, oval-shaped fruits that split open to release seeds. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and alternate, with a velvety texture that helps it conserve moisture in arid environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
