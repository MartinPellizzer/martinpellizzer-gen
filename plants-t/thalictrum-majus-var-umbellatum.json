It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in moist, shady environments. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse seeds by wind.
