    "intro": "Thlaspi tuberosum, commonly known as the rootstone cress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or arctic regions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are usually basal, with a somewhat succulent texture. Thlaspi tuberosum is characterized by its swollen, tuberous roots, which store nutrients and help it survive in harsh environments. It is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
