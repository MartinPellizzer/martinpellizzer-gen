    "intro": "Taxillus assamicus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant forms dense clusters on its host, often leading to the death of the host tree over time due to the heavy burden. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, fleshy berries that are a source of food for birds. Taxillus assamicus is found in the Indian subcontinent and parts of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates."
