    "intro": "Trichipteris vernicosa, commonly known as the glossy polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving them a shiny appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Trichipteris vernicosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
