    "intro": "Trigonella foenum-graecum subsp. indica, commonly known as Indian fenugreek, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces slender, hairy pods containing small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and cuisine. The botanical features of this subspecies make it distinct from the more widely known Trigonella foenum-graecum."
