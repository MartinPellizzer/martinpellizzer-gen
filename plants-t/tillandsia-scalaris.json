    "intro": "Tillandsia scalaris, commonly known as the scalloped air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often adorned with white or pale green markings. It thrives in humid, well-lit environments and requires regular misting to maintain moisture. Tillandsia scalaris is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
