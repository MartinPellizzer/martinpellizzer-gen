    "intro": "Terminalia gatopensis, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in dense clusters, giving it a snowball-like appearance. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. Terminalia gatopensis is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
