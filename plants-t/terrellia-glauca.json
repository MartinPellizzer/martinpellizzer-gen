    "intro": "Terrellia glauca, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, blue-gray flowers that bloom in late summer. Terrellia glauca is often found in moist, open woodlands and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its botanical name reflects its bluish-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance in natural settings."
