    "intro": "Tinospora coriacea, commonly known as Indian banyan, is a deciduous climbing shrub or vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by yellow, fleshy berries that contain numerous seeds. Tinospora coriacea is often found growing in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species in traditional medicine and ecological systems."
