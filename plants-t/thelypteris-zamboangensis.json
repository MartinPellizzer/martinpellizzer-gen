    "intro": "Thelypteris zamboangensis, commonly known as the Zamboanga water fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. The leaves are usually bi- to tri-pinnate, with a soft, leathery texture and a pale green to bluish-green color."
