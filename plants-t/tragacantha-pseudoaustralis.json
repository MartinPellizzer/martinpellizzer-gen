    "intro": "Tragacantha pseudoaustralis, commonly known as the coastal tragacanth, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a sticky resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
