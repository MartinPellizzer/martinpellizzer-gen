    "intro": "Turpinia pomifera var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf Chinese date, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes plants like the cashew and poison ivy. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to dates but are typically smaller and less sweet. It thrives in well-drained soil and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
