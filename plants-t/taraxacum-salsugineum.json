It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring a deep taproot for water storage and drought tolerance. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Taraxacum salsugineum is often found in rocky soils and is considered a pioneer species in disturbed or desert ecosystems."
