    "intro": "Thelymitra longifolia var. stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sun orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to southern Australia. It features a compact, leafy rosette with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, showy flowers with a bright yellow or orange coloration. The flowers are typically borne on tall, slender stems and are characterized by their elongated petals and lip. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Thelymitra longifolia. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or heathlands."
