    "intro": "Taraxacum cornubiense, commonly known as the Cornish dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the British Isles, particularly found in Cornwall and Devon. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine pubescence. Its yellow flowers bloom in early spring, producing a single, composite flower head that develops into a tuft of seeds with parachute-like structures. Taraxacum cornubiense is often found in grassy habitats and is considered a rare and locally distributed species."
