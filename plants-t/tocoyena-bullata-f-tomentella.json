    "intro": "Tocoyena bullata f. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly tocoyena, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a unique, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to withstand the cool, high-altitude conditions of its habitat. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
