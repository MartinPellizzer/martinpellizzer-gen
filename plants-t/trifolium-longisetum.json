    "intro": "Trifolium longisetum, commonly known as the long-hair clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Trifolium longisetum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems as a food source for various pollinators."
