    "intro": "Thujopsis dolabrata var. nana, commonly known as dwarf Japanese cedar, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features small, needle-like leaves that are dark green and glossy, arranged in dense clusters along the stems. The plant produces yellowish-green cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, adding ornamental value in the winter months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a foundation plant. Its compact size and hardy nature make it a popular choice for landscaping in cooler climates."
