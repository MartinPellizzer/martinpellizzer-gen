    "intro": "Trichomanes pseudonymanii, commonly known as the false moonwort, is a fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in crevices in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The plant's intricate morphology and specialized habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
