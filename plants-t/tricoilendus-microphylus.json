    "intro": "Tricoilendus microphylus, commonly known as the small-leafed tricoilendus, is a rare and delicate plant species characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. The plant's small, ovate leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to retain moisture and protect against desiccation. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in groups known as sori. Tricoilendus microphylus is often difficult to identify due to its subtle morphological features and limited distribution."
