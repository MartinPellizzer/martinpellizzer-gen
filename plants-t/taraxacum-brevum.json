It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering head that produces a cluster of small, yellow flowers. The plant is native to the eastern United States and is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides and woodland edges. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in various environmental conditions. The plant is also known for its ability to produce a milky latex when the leaves are damaged."
