    "intro": "Tiarella trifoliata var. laciniata, commonly known as the cut-leaved foamflower, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features delicate, nodding white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant's foliage is characterized by its finely cut, lobed leaves that form a basal rosette. It thrives in shady, moist woodland environments and is often found in rich, loamy soils. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for native plant gardens and naturalized landscapes."
