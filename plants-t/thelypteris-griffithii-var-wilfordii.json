It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and pinnately compound fronds. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance, which gives the genus its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
