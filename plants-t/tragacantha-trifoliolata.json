    "intro": "Tragacantha trifoliolata, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a flowering plant native to regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of its characteristic resinous sap. This sap, known as tragacanth, is harvested for its medicinal and industrial uses. Tragacantha trifoliolata is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils."
