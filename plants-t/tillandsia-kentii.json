    "intro": "Tillandsia kentii, commonly known as the Kent's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it capture water and light. It produces striking inflorescences with vivid red or orange flowers that bloom once in its lifetime. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
