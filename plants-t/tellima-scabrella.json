    "intro": "Tellima scabrella, commonly known as the rough tellima, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia, including China and Korea. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces clusters of pink to red flowers in the spring, which are followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. Its leaves are typically oval and have a rough, scaly texture, contributing to its common name. Tellima scabrella is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and mountain slopes."
