    "intro": "Tetramolopium fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically narrow and hairy. Tetramolopium fasciculatum is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insects."
