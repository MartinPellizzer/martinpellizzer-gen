    "intro": "Tragopyrum glaucum, commonly known as the bluegrass or glaucous thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and spiny, prickly stems, which provide a natural defense against herbivores. The plant produces small, purple to blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tragopyrum glaucum thrives in dry, open habitats like meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant ecosystems and a subject of interest in ecological and horticultural studies."
