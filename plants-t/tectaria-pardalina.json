    "intro": "Tectaria pardalina, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of brownish scales. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Tectaria pardalina plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
