    "intro": "Tillandsia bandensis subsp. bandensis, commonly known as the Bandensian air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
