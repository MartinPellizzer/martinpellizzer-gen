    "intro": "Tigridia convoluta, commonly known as the red spider lily, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking red, spider-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has strap-shaped, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Tigridia convoluta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also noted for its ability to naturalize in suitable climates. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
