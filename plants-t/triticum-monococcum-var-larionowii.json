    "intro": "Triticum monococcum var. larionowii, commonly known as the wild emmer wheat, is a wild species native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, spikelet-like inflorescence and is typically found growing in dry, rocky habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, hard grains that are adapted to survive in arid conditions. It is considered an important ancestor of modern wheat species due to its genetic diversity. This variety is often studied for its potential in breeding programs aimed at improving drought resistance in cultivated wheat."
