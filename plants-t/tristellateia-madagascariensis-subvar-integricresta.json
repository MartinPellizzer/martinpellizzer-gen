    "intro": "Tristellateia madagascariensis subvar. integricresta, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers, which are typically white or pale blue with a contrasting purple or brown center. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with each stem producing a cluster of leaves and flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
