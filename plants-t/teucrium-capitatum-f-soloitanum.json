It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
