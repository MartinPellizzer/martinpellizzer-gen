    "intro": "Toxicodendron grandidens, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, compound leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fuzzy berries, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. Toxicodendron grandidens is often found in moist, wooded areas and is part of the Anacardiaceae family."
