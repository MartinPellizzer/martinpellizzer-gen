    "intro": "Taraxacum micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The flower head consists of numerous small, yellow ray florets surrounded by tubular disc florets. It produces a capsule-like fruit that releases lightweight seeds with pappus for wind dispersal. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is widespread across temperate regions of Europe and Asia."
