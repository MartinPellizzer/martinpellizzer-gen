    "intro": "Tragia dentata, commonly known as the toothed tragia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or subshrub with woody stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of yellowish or greenish flowers that are typically small and inconspicuous. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. Tragia dentata is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
