    "intro": "Trifolium lagascanum, commonly known as the Lagasca clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. It is a member of the legume family, capable of nitrogen fixation through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
