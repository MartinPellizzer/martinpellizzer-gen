    "intro": "Thelypteris micropaleata, commonly known as the small-leaf shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Its rhizomes are wiry and often grow close to the ground, forming dense mats. Thelypteris micropaleata thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in woodland areas."
