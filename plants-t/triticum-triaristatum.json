    "intro": "Triticum triaristatum, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild relative of wheat that belongs to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with three-rowed glumes, which is where its scientific name originates. It is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural fields. Due to its genetic similarity to cultivated wheat, it has been studied for its potential role in breeding programs to improve wheat resilience."
