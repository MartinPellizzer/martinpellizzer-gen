    "intro": "Tillandsia boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has dense, fibrous roots that help anchor it to its host and absorb moisture from the air. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a layer of trichomes, which aid in water retention and photosynthesis. Tillandsia boliviana is admired for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in terrariums and hanging gardens."
