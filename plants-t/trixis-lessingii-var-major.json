It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and purple, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. This species is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
