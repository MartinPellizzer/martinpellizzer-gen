The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, depending on the variety. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a common sight in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
