It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
