    "intro": "Trimezia floscella, commonly known as the Christmas star, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow, strap-like, and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Trimezia floscella is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its drought tolerance and compact size."
