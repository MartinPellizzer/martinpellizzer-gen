    "intro": "Trifolium maritimum subsp. cinctum, commonly known as the coastal clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a distinctive white or pale margin. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often forming dense clusters. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt-laden environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
