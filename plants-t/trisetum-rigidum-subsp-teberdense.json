    "intro": "Trisetum rigidum subsp. teberdense, commonly known as the Turkish rigid grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect, stiff stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and slopes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid environments."
