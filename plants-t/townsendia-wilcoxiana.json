    "intro": "Townsendia wilcoxiana, commonly known as the Wilcox's fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in coastal areas, showing a preference for well-drained environments. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom from late winter to early spring, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
