    "intro": "Tormentilla vulgaris, commonly known as common tormentil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a creeping habit with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Tormentil is also known for its medicinal properties, having been used historically for its astringent and anti-inflammatory effects."
