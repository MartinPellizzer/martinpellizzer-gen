    "intro": "Trifolium subterraneum var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed clover, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It is a member of the legume family, capable of fixing nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in soil enrichment."
