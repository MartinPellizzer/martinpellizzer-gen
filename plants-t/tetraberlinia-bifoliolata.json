    "intro": "Tetraberlinia bifoliolata, commonly known as the two-leafed tetraberlinia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive bifoliate leaves, which consist of two leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
