    "intro": "Tamania, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a large aquatic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features broad, floating leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, providing shade over water bodies. The plant's roots anchor it in shallow water, while its stems support the massive leaves above the surface. Tamania produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its unique structure and ecological role make it an important species in freshwater ecosystems."
