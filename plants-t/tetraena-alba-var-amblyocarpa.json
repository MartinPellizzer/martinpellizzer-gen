    "intro": "Tetraena alba var. amblyocarpa, commonly known as the white tetraena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a shrub characterized by its small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has small, succulent leaves adapted to conserve water, typical of its harsh environment. It produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible and often consumed by native wildlife. This variety is notable for its resilience and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
