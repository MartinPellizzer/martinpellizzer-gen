    "intro": "Taraxacum cerbariense, commonly known as the Cerbarian dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and heart-shaped basal leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces a distinctive hollow stem and a puffball-like seed head that disperses its seeds by wind. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
