    "intro": "Tilia tucekii, commonly known as the Tu\u010dek's linden, is a deciduous tree native to central Europe. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fragrant white flowers that bloom in early summer. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain three-winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Tilia tucekii is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
