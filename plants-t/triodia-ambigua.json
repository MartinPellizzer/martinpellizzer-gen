    "intro": "Triodia ambigua, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with sharp, spiny edges that help reduce water loss. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small animals. Triodia ambigua is well adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought conditions."
