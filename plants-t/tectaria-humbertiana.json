    "intro": "Tectaria humbertiana, commonly known as the Humbert's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually divided into a series of lobes, forming a dense, broad structure that helps it thrive in humid environments. Tectaria humbertiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
