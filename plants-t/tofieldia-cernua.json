    "intro": "Tofieldia cernua, commonly known as the nodding grass-of-parnassus, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers that droop downward. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Tofieldia cernua is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
