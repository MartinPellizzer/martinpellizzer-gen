    "intro": "Taraxacum triste, commonly known as the weeping dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its slender, pale yellow flowers and elongated, drooping seed heads, which give it its distinctive appearance. Native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, while the roots are fibrous and adapted for survival in arid conditions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators, though it is less commonly cultivated than other dandelion species."
