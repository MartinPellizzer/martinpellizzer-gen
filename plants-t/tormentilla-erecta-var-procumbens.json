    "intro": "Tormentilla erecta var. procumbens, commonly known as creeping tormentill, is a low-growing shrub native to northern Europe. It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are elliptical, with a hairy texture, and it prefers moist, acidic soils in woodland or streamside habitats. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
