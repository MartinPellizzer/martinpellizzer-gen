    "intro": "Tapinanthus usambarensis, commonly known as the Usambarensis dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to East Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the stems or leaves of other plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure that allows it to spread along its host. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as forest edges and cultivated areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
