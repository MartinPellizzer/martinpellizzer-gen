    "intro": "Taraxacum sardomontanum, commonly known as the Sardinian dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sardinia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in rocky and calcareous soils, often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
