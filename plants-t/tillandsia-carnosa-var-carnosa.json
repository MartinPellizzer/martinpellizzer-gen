    "intro": "Tillandsia carnosa var. carnosa, commonly known as the showy tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its vibrant, bell-shaped flowers can range in color from white to pink, and it blooms in the summer. This plant requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive."
