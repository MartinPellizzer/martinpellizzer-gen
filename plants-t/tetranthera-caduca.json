    "intro": "Tetranthera caduca, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae. It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as eucalypts and acacias, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its seeds are dispersed by birds that feed on its fleshy, red berries. Tetranthera caduca is native to Australia and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on parasitic plant ecology and host-plant interactions."
