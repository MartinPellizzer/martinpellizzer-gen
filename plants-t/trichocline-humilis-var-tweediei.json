It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
