    "intro": "Tragia balfouriana, commonly known as the Balfour's tragia, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Tragia balfouriana is adapted to thrive in harsh, semi-desert conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
