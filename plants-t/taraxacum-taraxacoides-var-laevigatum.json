    "intro": "Taraxacum taraxacoides var. laevigatum, commonly known as the smoothleaf dandelion, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of smooth, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered with a fine white coating. The plant produces a single, hollow, leaf-like stem that terminates in a cluster of yellow flowers, which develop into spherical, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. This variety is distinguished by its smoother leaf surface compared to other dandelion species."
