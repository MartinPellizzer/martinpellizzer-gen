    "intro": "Trifolium incarnatum, commonly known as the crimson clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, clustered pink to red flowers. The plant is native to Europe and western Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant's flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance."
