    "intro": "Thymus oxyodontus, commonly known as the narrowleaf thyme, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often in mountainous regions, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine, hairy glands that release a strong, minty aroma. Thymus oxyodontus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
