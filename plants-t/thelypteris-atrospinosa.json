    "intro": "Thelypteris atrospinosa, commonly known as the black spine fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds and distinctive black spore cases, which give it its common name. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant's reproductive structures are typically located on the underside of the fronds, where they release spores for propagation."
