    "intro": "Thuja lycopodioides, commonly known as the creeping thuja, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Cupressaceae and is characterized by its dense, scale-like foliage that forms a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by cone-like structures, which release seeds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
