    "intro": "Teesdalia lepidium var. falciformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for moist, woodland habitats, and it is often found in shaded to partially sunny environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
