    "intro": "Taeniophyllum triangulare, commonly known as the triangular mossy orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees in humid, tropical environments, often in shaded forest understories. The plant has a distinctive triangular shape, with narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense, moss-like appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in a spike, and are often pale green or yellowish in color. Taeniophyllum triangulare is valued for its unique morphology and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
