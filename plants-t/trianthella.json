    "intro": "Trianthella, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often appear in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale pink. Trianthella species are generally herbaceous, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a preference for well-drained, sandy soils. They bloom during the cooler months, often in spring or early summer, and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to their unique appearance and limited distribution, some species are considered rare or endangered."
