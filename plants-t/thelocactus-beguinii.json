    "intro": "Thelocactus beguinii, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its greenish-gray stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Thelocactus beguinii is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can store water in its thick, fleshy stems."
