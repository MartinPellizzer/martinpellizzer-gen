    "intro": "Trichilia trimera, commonly known as African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local economies. However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
