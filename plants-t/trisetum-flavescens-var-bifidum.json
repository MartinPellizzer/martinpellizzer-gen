    "intro": "Trisetum flavescens var. bifidum, commonly known as the yellow false panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and produces panicles of small, yellowish to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as wetlands and marshes. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, while the stems are erect and slightly hairy. This variety is distinguished by its bifid (two-lobed) lemma tips, which are a key identifying feature in its taxonomy."
