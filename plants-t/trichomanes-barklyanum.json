    "intro": "Trichomanes barklyanum, commonly known as the barklyanum horestail, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical rainforests. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichomanes barklyanum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
