    "intro": "Trifolium albiceps, commonly known as the white-headed clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and fixes atmospheric nitrogen, enriching the soil. Trifolium albiceps is also valued for its role in ecological restoration and as a forage crop for livestock."
