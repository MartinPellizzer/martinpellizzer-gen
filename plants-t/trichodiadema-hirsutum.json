    "intro": "Trichodiadema hirsutum, commonly known as the woolly ice plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the warmer months. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soil. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
