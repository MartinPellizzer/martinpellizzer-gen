    "intro": "Tecoma heteropoda, commonly known as the yellow bells, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant is a shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of up to 6 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their color and nectar-rich structure. Tecoma heteropoda is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils in full sun."
