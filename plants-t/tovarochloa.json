    "intro": "Tovarochloa, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and compact growth habit, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. Tovarochloa is often found in dry grasslands and rocky soils, contributing to the ecological stability of these habitats. Its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions makes it an important component of native plant communities."
