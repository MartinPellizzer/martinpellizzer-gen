    "intro": "Trichilia pynaertii, commonly known as African sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its fragrant heartwood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
