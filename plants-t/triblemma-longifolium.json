    "intro": "Triblemma longifolium, commonly known as the longleaf triblemma, is a perennial herb native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, blooming during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
