    "intro": "Trichomanes hookeri var. majus, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its large, floating fronds. It belongs to the family Water Ferns (Pteridaceae) and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. Its fronds are typically broad, elongated, and have a waxy coating that aids in buoyancy. The species is noted for its unique reproductive structures and is of interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance."
