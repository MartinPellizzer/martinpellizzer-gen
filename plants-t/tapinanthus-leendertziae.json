    "intro": "Tapinanthus leendertziae, commonly known as the Leendertz's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange, thread-like stems that\u7f20\u7ed5 around host plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It is native to southern Africa, particularly in countries like South Africa and Namibia.
