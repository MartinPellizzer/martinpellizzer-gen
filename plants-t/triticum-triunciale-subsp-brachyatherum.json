    "intro": "Triticum triunciale subsp. brachyatherum, commonly known as the short awn wheat, is a wild wheat species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter awns compared to other wheat species. The plant typically produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences with glumes that are often hairy. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a flowering period that occurs in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to various environmental conditions."
