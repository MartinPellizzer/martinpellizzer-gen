    "intro": "Tillandsia ixioides subsp. viridiflora, commonly known as the Emerald Flower Tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped foliage that traps moisture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically green or yellow-green in color, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. This epiphytic plant does not require soil, instead absorbing nutrients and water through its leaves."
