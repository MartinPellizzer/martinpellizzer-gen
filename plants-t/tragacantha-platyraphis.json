    "intro": "Tragacantha platyraphis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically arranged in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing small, round seeds. Its root system is known for producing a viscous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. The species is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in open woodlands and scrublands."
