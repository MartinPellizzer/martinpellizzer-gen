    "intro": "Thea grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved tea plant, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by oval-shaped berries containing seeds. Its leaves are the primary part used for making tea, containing bioactive compounds such as caffeine and polyphenols. Thea grandifolia is valued not only for its medicinal properties but also for its role in traditional and modern herbal practices."
