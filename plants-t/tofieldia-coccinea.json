It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and striking red inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like structures. Tofieldia coccinea plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in early successional habitats."
