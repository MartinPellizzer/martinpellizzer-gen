    "intro": "Tragacantha subulifera, commonly known as the needleleaf tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Tragacantha subulifera is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
