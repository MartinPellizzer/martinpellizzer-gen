    "intro": "Tabernanthe elliptica, commonly known as the African nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to purple flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its nocturnal blooming habit and striking appearance make it a notable ornamental plant in botanical gardens."
