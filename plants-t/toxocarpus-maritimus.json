    "intro": "Toxocarpus maritimus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its blue or violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit and is often found growing on rocky shores or sandy soils. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs that provide protection against desiccation. Toxocarpus maritimus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions."
