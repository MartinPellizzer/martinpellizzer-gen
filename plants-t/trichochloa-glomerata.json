    "intro": "Trichochloa glomerata, commonly known as the clustered hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces clusters of tiny, spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Trichochloa glomerata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in riparian zones."
