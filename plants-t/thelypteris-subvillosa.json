    "intro": "Thelypteris subvillosa, commonly known as the silky water fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, finely hairy fronds that give it a soft, silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often submerged or partially submerged, anchoring it in wet soil or aquatic habitats. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
