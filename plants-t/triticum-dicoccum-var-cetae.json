    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum var. cetae, commonly known as naked barley, is a botanical variant of the barley species characterized by its lack of a hard outer hull, making it easier to process. It is native to the Fertile Crescent and has been cultivated for thousands of years. The plant produces compact, multi-branched inflorescences with small, two-lobed spikelets. Its grains are rich in protein and gluten, contributing to its use in traditional and modern food products. The botanical features of Triticum dicoccum var. cetae make it an important crop for both historical and contemporary agricultural practices."
