    "intro": "Tulipa raddii, commonly known as the Raddii tulip, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, often with a distinctive black eye. The plant produces strap-like leaves that are narrow and grass-like, typically growing from a bulbous base. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
