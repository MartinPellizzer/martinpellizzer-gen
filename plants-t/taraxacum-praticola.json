It is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. Its flowers develop into a spherical seed head with numerous parachute-like seeds, aiding in wind pollination and seed dispersal.
