    "intro": "Triticum repens var. stenophyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaved goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, narrow leaves and compact growth habit, typically reaching heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings but also serves as a forage plant for livestock."
