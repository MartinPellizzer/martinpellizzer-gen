    "intro": "Trisetum leoninum, commonly known as the golden beard grass, is a perennial grass species native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically golden or yellowish in color, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue and a rough texture. Trisetum leoninum is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
