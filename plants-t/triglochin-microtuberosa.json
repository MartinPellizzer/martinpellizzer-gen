    "intro": "Triglochin microtuberosa, commonly known as the small tuberous triglochin, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the Americas. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late summer. Its most distinctive feature is the presence of small tubers, which are underground storage organs used for propagation and survival. Triglochin microtuberosa is often found in marshy areas and is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels."
