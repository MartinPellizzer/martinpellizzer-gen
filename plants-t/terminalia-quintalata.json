It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow before falling in the dry season. The tree produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in dense, spherical clusters, giving it its common name. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine."
