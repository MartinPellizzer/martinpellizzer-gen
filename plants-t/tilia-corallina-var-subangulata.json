    "intro": "Tilia corallina var. subangulata, commonly known as the coral-leaf lime, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, coral-like leaves that are narrow and angular, giving it its specific epithet \"subangulata.\" The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. Its bark is smooth and light gray, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
