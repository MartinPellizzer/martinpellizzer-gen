    "intro": "Tetrarhaphis, commonly known as the silver sword, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. They are characterized by their dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, hair-like structures. Tetrarhaphis species typically produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. They are often cultivated as ornamental plants for their attractive appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions."
