    "intro": "Triticum monococcum var. boeoticum, commonly known as wild einkorn, is a wild species of wheat native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is a diploid species with a genome size of approximately 1.5 gigabases, making it one of the smallest wheat genomes. The plant typically grows as a low, compact annual grass with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in glumes and are often dispersed by wind or animals. This species is valued for its genetic diversity and potential use in breeding programs for modern wheat varieties."
