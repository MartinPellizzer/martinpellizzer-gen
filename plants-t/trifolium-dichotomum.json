    "intro": "Trifolium dichotomum, commonly known as the forked clover, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Trifolium dichotomum is often found in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
