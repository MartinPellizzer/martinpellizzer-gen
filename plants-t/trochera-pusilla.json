    "intro": "Trochera pusilla, commonly known as the small trochera, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific regions in southern Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
