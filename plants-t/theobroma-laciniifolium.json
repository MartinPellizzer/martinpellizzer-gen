It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers that develop into pods containing edible seeds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its fruit, known as a capsule, can grow up to 30 cm in length and contains up to 20 seeds. Theobroma laciniifolium is economically significant for its seeds, which are used to produce the popular nut product."
