    "intro": "Trifolium badium subsp. badium, commonly known as lesser clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to lanceolate leaflets, often with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the subspecies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
