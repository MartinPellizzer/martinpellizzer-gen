    "intro": "Thylacospermum, commonly known as the \"spear lichen,\" is a genus of lichens that belong to the family Verrucariaceae. These lichens are characterized by their crustose or foliose thallus, which is often covered in a layer of fine, granular structures. They are typically found on rocks, soil, or bark in temperate and boreal regions. Thylacospermum species are known for their ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, including drought and extreme temperatures. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in ecological studies due to their sensitivity to air pollution."
