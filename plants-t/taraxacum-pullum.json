    "intro": "Taraxacum pullum, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are hairy and covered in white pubescence. Its yellow flowers bloom in early spring, producing a single, composite inflorescence that later develops into a fluffy seed head. Taraxacum pullum is adapted to rocky and alpine environments, exhibiting a robust root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils."
