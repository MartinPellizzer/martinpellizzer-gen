    "intro": "Teline rosmarinifolia var. stipulata, commonly known as the stipulate teline, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, aromatic stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are linear to lanceolate, often with small stipules at the base. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a desirable addition to Mediterranean-style gardens."
