    "intro": "Turbinicarpus beguinii subsp. hintoniorum, commonly known as the Hinton's turbinicarpus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed, spiny stem that typically measures around 5\u201310 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
