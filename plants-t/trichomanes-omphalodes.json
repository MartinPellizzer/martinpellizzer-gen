    "intro": "Trichomanes omphalodes, commonly known as the \"liverwort of the heart,\" is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often clustered at the base. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. It is often found on rocks or decaying wood in temperate regions. Trichomanes omphalodes plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
