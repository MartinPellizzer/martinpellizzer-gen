    "intro": "Thujopsis keteleeri, commonly known as Keteleer's arborvitae, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, scale-like foliage that remains throughout the year. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green cones, which are typically found at the tips of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in temperate climates."
