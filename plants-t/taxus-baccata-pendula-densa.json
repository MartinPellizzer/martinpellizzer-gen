It is a slow-growing evergreen with dark green, needle-like leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for ornamental gardens. Its unique form and longevity make it a popular choice for landscape design."
