    "intro": "Trifolium medium var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a narrow, pointed tip. The plant produces small, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically forming dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and as a forage crop for livestock."
