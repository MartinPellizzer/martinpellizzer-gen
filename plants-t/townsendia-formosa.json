    "intro": "Townsendia formosa, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine regions. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation for plants in its environment. Townsendia formosa is often found in meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
