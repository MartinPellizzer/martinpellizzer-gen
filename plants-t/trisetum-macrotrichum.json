    "intro": "Trisetum macrotrichum, commonly known as the hairy broomgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, fluffy panicles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers arranged in panicles, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Trisetum macrotrichum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
