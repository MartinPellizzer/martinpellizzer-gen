    "intro": "Trichostephania, commonly known as the \"water fern,\" is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, feathery fronds that often grow submerged or partially submerged in freshwater environments. Trichostephania species typically have a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow them to spread across the substrate. Their leaves are usually lance-shaped and possess a unique structure with small, hair-like projections along the veins. These ferns play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
