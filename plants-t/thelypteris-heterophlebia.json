    "intro": "Thelypteris heterophlebia, commonly known as the variable shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that exhibit variations in shape and size, often with a bipinnate structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Thelypteris heterophlebia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage."
