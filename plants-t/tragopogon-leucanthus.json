    "intro": "Tragopogon leucanthus, commonly known as the white goatsbeard, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces a distinctive seed head with bristly, hair-like structures that aid in wind dispersal. Native to Europe, it has been introduced to various regions, including North America, where it often grows in disturbed soils. Tragopogon leucanthus is typically found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas with well-drained soil."
