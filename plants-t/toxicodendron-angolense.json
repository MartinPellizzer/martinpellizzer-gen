    "intro": "Toxicodendron angolense, commonly known as the Angola poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which typically consist of three to five oval-shaped leaflets arranged oppositely along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. It is known for its toxic properties, containing urushiol, a substance that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. Due to its harmful effects, it is often avoided or handled with caution."
