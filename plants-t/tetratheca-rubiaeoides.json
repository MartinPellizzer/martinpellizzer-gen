    "intro": "Tetratheca rubiaeoides, commonly known as the pink mallee or red mallee, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It belongs to the family Theaceae and is characterized by its dense, woody structure and clusters of small, pink or red flowers. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
