    "intro": "Timonius koordersii, commonly known as the Koord's timonius, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments. Its botanical features include a slender, upright stem and a unique arrangement of leaves that resemble those of a fern. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
