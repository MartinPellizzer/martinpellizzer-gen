    "intro": "Tisserantiodoxa oubanguiensis, commonly known as the Central African water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Congo River basin. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that float on the water's surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces showy white flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, allowing it to thrive in slow-moving freshwater environments. Tisserantiodoxa oubanguiensis plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by supporting biodiversity and stabilizing water ecosystems."
