    "intro": "Taraxacum hercynicum, commonly known as the Hercynian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a distinctive hollow stem with a milky sap, which is typical of the genus Taraxacum. It is native to Central and Eastern Europe and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The species is often found in meadows, forest edges, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and supports pollinators."
