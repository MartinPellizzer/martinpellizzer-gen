    "intro": "Tripogon copei, commonly known as the Cape mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to brownish spikelets that are clustered at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
