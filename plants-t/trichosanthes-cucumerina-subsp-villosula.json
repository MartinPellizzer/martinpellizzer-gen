    "intro": "Trichosanthes cucumerina subsp. villosula, commonly known as the hairy bitter melon, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, elongated fruits that are typically green when mature. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its edible fruits, although they are known to be quite bitter. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture, and the flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which gives it its common name."
