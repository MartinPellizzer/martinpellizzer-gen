    "intro": "Tragopogon pterocarpus, commonly known as the yellow goat's beard, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets and a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats, including meadows and roadsides, across parts of Europe and Asia. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stem is upright and often branched. The fruit is a slender, winged achene that aids in wind dispersal, contributing to its widespread distribution."
