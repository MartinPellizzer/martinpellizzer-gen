    "intro": "Tradescantia standleyi, commonly known as the Mexican spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Commelinaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found growing in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or forested areas. It is a perennial herb that can spread through rhizomes, making it somewhat invasive in certain regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
