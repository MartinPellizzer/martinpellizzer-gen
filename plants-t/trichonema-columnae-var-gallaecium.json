    "intro": "Trichonema columnae var. gallaecium, commonly known as the Galician feather moss, is a rare and specialized moss species native to the coastal regions of Galicia, Spain. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. The plant is characterized by its delicate, feathery appearance, with densely packed, slender shoots that form a dense carpet. Its small, elongated leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern, contributing to its unique aesthetic. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
