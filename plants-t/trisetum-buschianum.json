    "intro": "Trisetum buschianum, commonly known as Busch's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Trisetum buschianum is often found in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges. Its adaptability to various soil types and its ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
