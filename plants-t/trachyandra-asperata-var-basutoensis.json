It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
