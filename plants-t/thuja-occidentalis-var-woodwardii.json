    "intro": "Thuja occidentalis var. woodwardii, commonly known as the American arborvitae or northern white cedar, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like foliage that is typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or riparian habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
