    "intro": "Tounatea penomenensis, commonly known as the Phenomenal Touna, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes trees and shrubs known for their aromatic wood and medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white and yellow. Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tounatea penomenensis is considered endangered and is the subject of ongoing botanical research."
