    "intro": "Triticum muticum hybernum, commonly known as the bog wheat, is a perennial grass species native to wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. It has slender, hairless stems that often grow in dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow and linear with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in temperate regions of Europe and North America. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat for various invertebrates and its contribution to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems."
