    "intro": "Taeniophyllum schlechteri, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae. It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus Ficus, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized roots. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually clustered in dense groups, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which eat the fleshy berries and excrete the seeds elsewhere. This species is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical rainforests."
