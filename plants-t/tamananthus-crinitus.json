    "intro": "Tamananthus crinitus, commonly known as the curly hair tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, curling, hair-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forest or savanna habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some tropical and subtropical gardens."
