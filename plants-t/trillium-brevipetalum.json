    "intro": "Trillium brevipetalum, commonly known as the short-petalled trillium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the plant family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its three broadly ovate leaves and three white petals. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing a single, nodding flower with three sepals and three petals. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
