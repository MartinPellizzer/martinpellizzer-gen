    "intro": "Tillandsia moscosoi, commonly known as the Moscoso air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it collect moisture from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
