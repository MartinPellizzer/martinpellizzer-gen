    "intro": "Thymus zygis subsp. ilerdensis, commonly known as the Iberian thyme, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and aromatic, tiny greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, as well as its role in supporting local biodiversity."
