    "intro": "Teucrium \u00d7 contejeanii, commonly known as the hybrid germander, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves with a grayish-green hue and produces clusters of small, blue-violet flowers. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, showing drought tolerance once established. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a hybrid between Teucrium polium and Teucrium scorodonicum."
