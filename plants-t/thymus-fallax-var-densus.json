    "intro": "Thymus fallax var. densus, commonly known as dense thyme, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves that are densely packed, giving the plant a lush, carpet-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, pink or lavender flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or borders. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular plant in both gardens and herbal medicine."
