    "intro": "Tillandsia alta, commonly known as the sky plant or cloud plant, is an epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree branches or rocks. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its unique growth habits and aesthetic appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
