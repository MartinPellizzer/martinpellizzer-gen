    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 mediana, commonly known as the hybrid linden, is a deciduous tree that results from the cross between Tilia cordata and Tilia europaea. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically rounded and have a smooth texture. The tree produces fragrant, pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and grey, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in temperate regions across Europe. Tilia \u00d7 mediana is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in hedgerows and urban landscapes."
