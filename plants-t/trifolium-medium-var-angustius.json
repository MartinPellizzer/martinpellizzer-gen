    "intro": "Trifolium medium var. angustius, commonly known as narrow-leaved white clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically narrow and have a pale green to white coloration. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in dense clusters, often in the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in agricultural and ecological restoration settings."
