    "intro": "Triticum vulgare subvar. inflatum, commonly known as the inflated wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its unique seed head structure. The plant is typically found in temperate regions and is known for its distinctive, swollen spikelets that give it a more ornamental appearance compared to standard wheat varieties. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is closely related to other cereal grains. The inflated spikelets are a result of genetic variation, which may influence its growth patterns and seed dispersal mechanisms. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its morphological traits and potential agricultural applications."
