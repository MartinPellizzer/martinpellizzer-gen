    "intro": "Tephrocactus camachoi, commonly known as the Sonoran ghost cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert. It is a small, columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a ribbed stem and a spiny, rounded crown. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study."
