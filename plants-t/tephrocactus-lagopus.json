    "intro": "Tephrocactus lagopus, commonly known as the desert nightshade cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its spines are short and often covered in a fine, white coating that helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant's adaptations make it well-suited for xerophytic environments where water is scarce."
