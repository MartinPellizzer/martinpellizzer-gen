    "intro": "Thelypteris rubida, commonly known as the red fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often display a reddish hue, especially when young. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Thelypteris rubida is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats."
