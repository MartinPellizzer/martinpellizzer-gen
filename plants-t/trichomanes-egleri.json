    "intro": "Trichomanes egleri, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a delicate evergreen fern native to North America. It features a distinctive, arching frond with a serrated margin and a unique, curled shape that resembles a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative growth. Trichomanes egleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its year-round foliage."
