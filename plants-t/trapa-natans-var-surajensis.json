    "intro": "Trapa natans var. surajensis, commonly known as the Indian water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its floating leaves and distinctive spiny fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense vegetation. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting aquatic life and its historical use in traditional medicine."
