It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, typical of the dandelion genus. This species is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a common weed in many regions."
