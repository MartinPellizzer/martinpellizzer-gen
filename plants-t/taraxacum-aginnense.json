    "intro": "Taraxacum aginnense, commonly known as the Aghinian dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, inconspicuous yellow flower head. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, typical of the genus Taraxacum. It is native to regions of southern Europe and is often found in meadows and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
