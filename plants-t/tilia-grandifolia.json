    "intro": "Tilia grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaf lime or bigleaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 10 inches in diameter, with a smooth, often hairy underside. The tree produces small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are followed by small, winged fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks. Tilia grandifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
