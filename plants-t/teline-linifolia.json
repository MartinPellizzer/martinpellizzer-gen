    "intro": "Teline linifolia, commonly known as silky teline, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, silky hairs that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Teline linifolia is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
