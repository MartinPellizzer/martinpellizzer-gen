    "intro": "Thymus webbianus, commonly known as the western narrow-leaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically has small, narrow leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of pink or purple flowers in the spring. Thymus webbianus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Its aromatic properties make it a valued plant in both traditional medicine and culinary applications."
