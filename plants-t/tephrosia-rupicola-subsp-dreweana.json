    "intro": "Tephrosia rupicola subsp. dreweana, commonly known as the rock tephrosia, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by bean-like pods containing seeds. It is adapted to survive in poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions. This species is sometimes used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
