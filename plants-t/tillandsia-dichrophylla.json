    "intro": "Tillandsia dichrophylla, commonly known as the silver pine air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a silvery, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity."
