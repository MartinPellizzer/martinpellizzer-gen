    "intro": "Taraxacum integrifolium, commonly known as the smooth dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of smooth, entire leaves and a long, hollow stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets. After flowering, it produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus. This species is commonly found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed soils across temperate regions."
