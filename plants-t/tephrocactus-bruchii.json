    "intro": "Tephrocactus bruchii, commonly known as the Bruch's cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise desolate appearance. Its spines are short and often cover the entire body, providing protection from herbivores. Tephrocactus bruchii is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
