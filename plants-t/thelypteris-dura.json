    "intro": "Thelypteris dura, commonly known as the hard fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often dark green and covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Thelypteris dura is a perennial plant that produces spores rather than seeds, typical of the fern family."
