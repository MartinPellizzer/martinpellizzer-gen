    "intro": "Tilia latebracteata, commonly known as the late bract maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and its distinctive, showy bracts that surround the small flowers. The tree produces samaras, which are winged seeds that aid in wind dispersal. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The late bract maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
