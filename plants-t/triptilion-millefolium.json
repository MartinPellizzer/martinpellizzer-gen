    "intro": "Triptilion millefolium, commonly known as the common yarrow, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a lacy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. Triptilion millefolium is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties."
