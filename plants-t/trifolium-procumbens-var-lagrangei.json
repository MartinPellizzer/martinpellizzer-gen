    "intro": "Trifolium procumbens var. lagrangei, commonly known as Lagrange's\u530d\u5310\u4e09\u53f6\u8349, is a low-growing perennial herb native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
