    "intro": "Thymus sosnowskyi, commonly known as Sosnowsky's thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features compact, creeping stems covered in tiny, rounded leaves that are densely packed and often grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
