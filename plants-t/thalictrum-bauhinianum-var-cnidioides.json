It features slender, often prostrate stems that spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided leaflets that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
