    "intro": "Triticum caespitosum, commonly known as goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Botanically, it is closely related to wheat and has been studied for its potential in ecological restoration and as a forage crop."
