    "intro": "Tecticornia pergranulata subsp. elongata, commonly known as the long-haired tecticornia, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid regions of Australia. It features wiry, erect stems covered in dense, white to greyish hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to minimize transpiration and maximize water retention. This subspecies is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes."
