    "intro": "Taraxacum abbreviatulum, commonly known as the dwarf dandelion, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a short, sturdy stem that supports a single flowering head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, typical of the Compositae family. It produces a distinctive, spherical seed head that disperses seeds via wind, a common adaptation in the genus Taraxacum. This plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
