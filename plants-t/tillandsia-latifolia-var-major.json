    "intro": "Tillandsia latifolia var. major, commonly known as the broad-leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, powdery trichomes. These trichomes help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces showy, bell-shaped inflorescences that can range in color from yellow to red, depending on the variety."
