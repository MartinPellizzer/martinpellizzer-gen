It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant features a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing wind-dispersed seeds. Taraxacum gelertiiforme is often found in rocky soils and meadows, thriving in nutrient-poor environments."
