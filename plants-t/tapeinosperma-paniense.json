    "intro": "Tapeinosperma paniense, commonly known as the Pani\u00e9 tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the humid forests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and dense canopy of elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy fruits with a sweet, aromatic pulp. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and potential economic value, though it remains relatively understudied in scientific literature."
