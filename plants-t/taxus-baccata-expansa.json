    "intro": "Taxus baccata expansa, commonly known as the English yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to western and central Europe. It is characterized by its elongated, needle-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath. The plant produces red, fleshy arils surrounding its seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It is highly toxic to humans and animals, containing potent alkaloids such as taxine. Despite its toxicity, it is valued for its ornamental appearance and historical use in timber and medicine."
