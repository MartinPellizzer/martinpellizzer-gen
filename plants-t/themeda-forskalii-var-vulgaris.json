    "intro": "Themeda forskalii var. vulgaris, commonly known as the tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically green to bluish-gray in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer, which are clustered in panicles. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is widely used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
