It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy yellow flowers. The plant features palmate leaves with a distinctive lobed shape, and its stems are often covered in fine, silky hairs.

Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
