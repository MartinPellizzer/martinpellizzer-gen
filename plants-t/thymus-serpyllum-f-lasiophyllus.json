    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. lasiophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thyme, is a subspecies of thyme characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic, narrow leaves. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications. This subspecies is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
