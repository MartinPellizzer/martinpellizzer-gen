    "intro": "Tribulus gillettiae, commonly known as the desert burr, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub-like species that produces small, yellowish flowers and distinctive, spiny seed pods. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Tribulus gillettiae is often found in sandy soils and can play a role in stabilizing dunes in its native habitat."
