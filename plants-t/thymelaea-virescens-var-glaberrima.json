It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are usually small,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and covered in a fine, waxy coating. This variety is characterized by its lack of hairy texture on its stems and leaves, giving it a smooth, glabrous appearance."
