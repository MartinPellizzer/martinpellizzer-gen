    "intro": "Thymus tenuifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color and densely packed along the stems. The plant produces tiny pink or white flowers in spring, which are clustered in rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant ground cover. Its foliage is often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its pungent, aromatic properties."
