It features upright, branched stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed. Tridens strictus is often found in moist meadows and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full sun."
