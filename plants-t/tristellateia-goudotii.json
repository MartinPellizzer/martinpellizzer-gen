    "intro": "Tristellateia goudotii, commonly known as the African ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the orchid family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly found in the arid regions of Namibia and South Africa. This plant is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale, translucent petals and a delicate, almost ethereal structure. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires specific environmental conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
