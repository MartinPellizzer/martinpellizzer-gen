    "intro": "Tepualia stipularis, commonly known as the Brazilian morning glory, is a climbing vine native to South America. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth habit and its ability to climb by twining around supports. Its flowers open in the morning and close at dusk, hence its common name. Tepualia stipularis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
