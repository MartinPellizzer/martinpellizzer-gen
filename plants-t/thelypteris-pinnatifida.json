    "intro": "Thelypteris pinnatifida, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, including regions such as China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its feather-like fronds that are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices, and prefers well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the spores are released during the autumn season. Thelypteris pinnatifida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shaded garden settings."
