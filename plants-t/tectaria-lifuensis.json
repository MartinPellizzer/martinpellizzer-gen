    "intro": "Tectaria lifuensis, commonly known as the Lifuensis shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which are typically divided into segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate, while its leaves are usually leathery and dark green. Tectaria lifuensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing microhabitats for various small organisms."
