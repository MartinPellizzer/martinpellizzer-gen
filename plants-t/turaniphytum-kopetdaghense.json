It is a perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue or violet flowers in late summer. The plant grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
