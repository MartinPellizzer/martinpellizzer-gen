    "intro": "Tetragonolobus scandalida, commonly known as the scarlet burr vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tetragonal (four-sided) stems and trifoliate leaves, which are composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces distinctive burr-like pods that are covered in hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, adding a vibrant color to the landscape during the growing season."
