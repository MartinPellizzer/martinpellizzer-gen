    "intro": "Tragacantha scrobiculata, commonly known as the Persian gum or tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of distinctive, inflated seed pods. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The sap of Tragacantha scrobiculata is viscous and has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural thickening agent."
