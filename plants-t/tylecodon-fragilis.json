    "intro": "Tylecodon fragilis, commonly known as the brittle ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Tylecodon fragilis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
