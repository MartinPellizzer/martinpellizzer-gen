It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features a robust, upright stem with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a single, showy yellow flower surrounded by white bracts, which attracts pollinators like bees. The species is characterized by its ability to hybridize with other Tragopogon species, contributing to its ecological and botanical significance."
