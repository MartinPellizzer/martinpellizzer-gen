    "intro": "Tapinanthus irebuensis, commonly known as the African dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the stems of other plants through specialized haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of suitable host species, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its environment. Due to its parasitic nature, it can sometimes cause damage to crops and native vegetation."
