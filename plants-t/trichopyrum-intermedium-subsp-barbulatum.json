The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for various insects and small animals."
