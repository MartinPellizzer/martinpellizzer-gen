    "intro": "Tillandsia seideliana, commonly known as the Seidel's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is well adapted to epiphytic life. Its unique structure allows it to survive in a variety of habitats, including trees and rocky surfaces."
