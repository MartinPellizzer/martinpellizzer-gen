    "intro": "Thymus calamintha, commonly known as blue thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its aromatic, small, needle-like leaves and clusters of pale blue to purple flowers. The plant produces tiny, four-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Thymus calamintha is often used in herbal teas and as a culinary herb due to its strong, minty aroma."
