    "intro": "Triticum spelta aristatum, commonly known as foxtail wheat, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, bristly spikes that resemble a foxtail, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture. Triticum spelta aristatum is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in other open areas where it can spread easily through its seeds."
