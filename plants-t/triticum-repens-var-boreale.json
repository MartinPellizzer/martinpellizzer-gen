    "intro": "Triticum repens var. boreale, commonly known as northern meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, leafy stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in wetland habitats."
