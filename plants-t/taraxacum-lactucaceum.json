    "intro": "Taraxacum lactucaceum, commonly known as the lettuce dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a distinctive seed ball. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and grasslands. It produces a milky sap that contains latex, which can be irritating to the skin. The species is closely related to other dandelion species but is distinguished by its smaller size and unique floral structure."
