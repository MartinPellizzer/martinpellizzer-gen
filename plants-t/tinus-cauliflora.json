    "intro": "Tinus cauliflora, commonly known as the pineapple lily, is a striking ornamental plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, fleshy, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its unique foliage and flowering habit make it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Tinus cauliflora is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
