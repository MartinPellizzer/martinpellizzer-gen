    "intro": "Tripidium bengalense, commonly known as the Bengal arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South and Southeast Asia. It features long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellowish, which are followed by oval, berry-like fruits. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
