    "intro": "Tephrothamnus, commonly known as the sandthorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It consists of shrubs and subshrubs that are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plants are characterized by their spiny stems and small, often yellow or white flowers. They are adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems and thick foliage to conserve water. Tephrothamnus species are sometimes used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in degraded lands."
