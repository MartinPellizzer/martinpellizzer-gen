    "intro": "Trigonella elliptica var. late-alata, commonly known as the late-winged fenugreek, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branching stems that often grow in moist, calcareous soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels, followed by linear, lomentous pods that release tiny seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with elliptical leaflets that are slightly hairy. This variety is distinguished by its later blooming habit compared to other Trigonella species, typically flowering in late summer."
