    "intro": "Tintinnabularia, commonly known as the \"whiskered sea snail,\" is a genus of small marine gastropod mollusks belonging to the family Tintinnabulidae. These organisms are characterized by their delicate, translucent shells that often exhibit intricate patterns and colors. They are typically found in shallow coastal waters and are known for their unique, whorled shell structures. Tintinnabularia species play a role in marine ecosystems as both predators and prey. Their life cycle includes a free-swimming larval stage followed by a sessile adult stage."
