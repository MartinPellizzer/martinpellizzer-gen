    "intro": "Triticum ciliare, commonly known as slender wheat, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves with ciliate margins, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces spikelets that are often clustered in panicles. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields, where it can become a weed in agricultural settings. Due to its adaptability, Triticum ciliare is sometimes cultivated for forage or as a cover crop."
