    "intro": "Trichoon, commonly known as the velvet tare, is an annual legume belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pods containing several elliptical seeds. Trichoon is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It has been used historically as a forage crop and in traditional medicine."
