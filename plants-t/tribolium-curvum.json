It is characterized by its small, oval body and a distinctive curved snout, which is adapted for feeding on stored grains. The beetle's exoskeleton is typically hard and metallic in appearance, providing protection against environmental stressors. It is primarily found in temperate regions and is known to infest various cereal crops such as wheat, barley, and corn. Due to its ability to damage stored food products, it is considered a significant pest in agricultural settings."
