    "intro": "Toxopteris, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. These plants are typically small, with slender, often creeping rhizomes and delicate, bipinnate fronds. They thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky surfaces or in woodland areas. Toxopteris species are characterized by their finely divided leaves and the presence of sporangia on the undersides of the fronds. Their reproductive structures are usually clustered in sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous indusium."
