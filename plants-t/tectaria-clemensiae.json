    "intro": "Tectaria clemensiae, commonly known as the Clemen's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on trees in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its host, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
