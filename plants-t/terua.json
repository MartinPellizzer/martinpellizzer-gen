It is characterized by its distinctive, velvety, overlapping leaves that form a rosette shape, often with a deep green or bronze hue. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in spring, which are clustered in umbels. Terua thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
