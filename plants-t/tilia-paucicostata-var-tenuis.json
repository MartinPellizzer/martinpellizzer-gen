    "intro": "Tilia paucicostata var. tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lime or slender-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically lighter green than those of other linden species. The flowers are small, fragrant, and clustered in drooping inflorescences, which bloom in early summer. The wood is light, soft, and has a fine grain, making it suitable for carving and furniture. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
