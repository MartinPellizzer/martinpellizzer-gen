    "intro": "Trichocereus eremophilus, commonly known as the Mexican torch cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems and nocturnal blooming flowers. The plant produces large, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. The plant is also known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, making it well adapted to desert conditions."
