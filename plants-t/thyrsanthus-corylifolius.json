    "intro": "Thyrsanthus corylifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved thyrsanthus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rutaceae. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, woody, spiny fruits. It is typically found in forested areas and is adapted to the temperate climate of its native habitat. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
