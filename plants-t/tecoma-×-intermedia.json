It is a cross between Tecoma staminea and Tecoma capensis, resulting in a plant with distinctive yellow-orange tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 feet, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is well-suited for warm climates, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value."
