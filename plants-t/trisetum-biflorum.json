    "intro": "Trisetum biflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like turf with slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other wetland habitats. Trisetum biflorum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
