    "intro": "Tristania capitellata, commonly known as the Tristania tree, is a species native to the island of Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a small evergreen tree that typically grows in coastal areas and rocky soils. The plant has simple, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, terminal heads. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Tristania capitellata is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its isolated and harsh environment."
