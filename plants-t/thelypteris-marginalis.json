    "intro": "Thelypteris marginalis, commonly known as the marginal holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a slightly wavy or serrated edge. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round foliage in suitable habitats."
