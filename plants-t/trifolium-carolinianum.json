    "intro": "Trifolium carolinianum, commonly known as Carolina clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. Carolina clover is valued for its ecological benefits, including nitrogen fixation and serving as a food source for pollinators."
