    "intro": "Taraxacum ungulatum, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces achene fruits with pappus for wind dispersal. Taraxacum ungulatum is adapted to cold climates and is often found in open, sunny habitats at high altitudes."
