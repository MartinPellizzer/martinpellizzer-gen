    "intro": "Trichodium arenarium, commonly known as the sand mat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, adapted to thrive in sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping it retain moisture in harsh environments. Trichodium arenarium is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
