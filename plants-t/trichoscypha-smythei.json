    "intro": "Trichoscypha smythei, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and thick, succulent trunk that stores water. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Trichoscypha smythei is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some African cultures."
