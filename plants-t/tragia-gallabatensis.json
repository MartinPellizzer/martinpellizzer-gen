    "intro": "Tragia gallabatensis, commonly known as the African ironweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its woody stem and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in hard, spiny capsules, a feature that aids in seed dispersal. Tragia gallabatensis is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to arid conditions."
