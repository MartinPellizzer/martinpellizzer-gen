    "intro": "Thelocephala malleolata var. solitaria, commonly known as the solitary bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for trapping microscopic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, while its flowers are small and often greenish-white in color. This variant is known for its limited distribution and is considered a specialist in specific aquatic habitats."
