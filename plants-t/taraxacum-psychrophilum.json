    "intro": "Taraxacum psychrophilum, commonly known as the polar dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that produces a single, yellow composite flower. This species is adapted to grow in harsh, alpine or arctic environments, where it thrives in low temperatures and poor soil conditions. Its ability to survive in such extreme climates makes it an important indicator species for cold ecosystems. The plant's botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptations to withstand freezing temperatures and limited nutrient availability."
