It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Taihangia rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
