    "intro": "Trifolium kingii, commonly known as King's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is native to parts of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in grassland and rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It is a perennial herb that plays a role in soil stabilization and supports local pollinators. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
