    "intro": "Thelypteris subjuncta, commonly known as the subtropical holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are usually short and rhizomatosic, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
