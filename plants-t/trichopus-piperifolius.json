    "intro": "Trichopus piperifolius, commonly known as the pepperleaf plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, pinnately compound leaves that resemble those of the pepper plant. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers that are often followed by dark, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its unique foliage and historical use in traditional medicine, it holds significance in both horticulture and ethnobotany."
