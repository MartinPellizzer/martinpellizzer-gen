    "intro": "Thelypteris decurtata subsp. platensis, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are often broad and leathery in texture. The fronds are typically arching, with a distinctive dark green color and a waxy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters known as sori."
