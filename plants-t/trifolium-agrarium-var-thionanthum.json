    "intro": "Trifolium agrarium var. thionanthum, commonly known as the sulfur-flowered clover, is a variant of the agrarium clover species. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that emit a faint sulfur-like odor, which is a unique trait among clover species. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Its trifoliate leaves are composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is a herbaceous perennial. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its specialized floral chemistry and ecological adaptations."
