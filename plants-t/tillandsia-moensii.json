    "intro": "Tillandsia moensii, commonly known as the Moensii air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette structure, which helps to collect and retain moisture. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Tillandsia moensii is well adapted to humid environments and can thrive in indirect sunlight."
