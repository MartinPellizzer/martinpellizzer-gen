    "intro": "Tribulus ehrenbergii, commonly known as desert bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its unique, spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Tribulus ehrenbergii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though scientific evidence supporting these uses is limited."
