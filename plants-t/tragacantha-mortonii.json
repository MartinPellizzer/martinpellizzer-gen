    "intro": "Tragacantha mortonii, commonly known as the Morton's tragacanth, is a species of flowering plant native to the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant produces a gum that is similar to tragacanth, which is used in traditional medicine and as a natural thickening agent. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and coastal areas. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
