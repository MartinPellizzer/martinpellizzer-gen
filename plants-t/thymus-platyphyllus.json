    "intro": "Thymus platyphyllus, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny pink or white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. Thymus platyphyllus is valued for its aromatic properties and is often used in herbal remedies and culinary applications."
