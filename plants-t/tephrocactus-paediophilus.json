    "intro": "Tephrocactus paediophilus, commonly known as the miniature cactus or baby cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly hair that helps protect it from intense sunlight and water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attractive. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a potted plant. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
