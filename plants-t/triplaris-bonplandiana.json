    "intro": "Triplaris bonplandiana, commonly known as the Brazilian candlewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, candle-like fruits that give it its common name. Its bark and leaves contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, making it of interest to researchers. However, due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in its native range."
