    "intro": "Taraxacum furvum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the dandelion family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by elongated, bristly seed heads. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Taraxacum furvum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun."
