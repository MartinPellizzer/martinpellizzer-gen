    "intro": "Trichandrum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Trichandrum is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain areas. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
