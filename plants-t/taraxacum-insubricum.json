    "intro": "Taraxacum insubricum, commonly known as the Italian dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a bright yellow composite flower that develops into a spherical seed head with numerous parachute-like seeds. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in dry, sunny grasslands and disturbed soils. This species is closely related to other dandelion species but is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and geographic distribution."
