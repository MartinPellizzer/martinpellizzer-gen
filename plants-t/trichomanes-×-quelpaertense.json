    "intro": "Trichomanes \u00d7 quelpaertense, commonly known as the Quelpaert huperbole, is a hybrid fern native to the Korean Peninsula. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a feature common among ferns. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
