    "intro": "Tillandsia geotropica, commonly known as the mountain air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. This plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding to its ornamental appeal."
