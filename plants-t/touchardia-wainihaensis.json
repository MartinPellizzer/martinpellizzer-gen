    "intro": "Touchardia wainihaensis, commonly known as the Wainiha endemic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
