It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody pod, and the tree can grow up to 20 meters tall in suitable conditions. Tachigali barnebyi is often found in humid lowland forests and is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity."
