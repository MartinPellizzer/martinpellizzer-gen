    "intro": "Tapinanthus globifer subsp. bornuensis, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Acacia*. It possesses specialized roots called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by animals. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health and growth of its host trees."
