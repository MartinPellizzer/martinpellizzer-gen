    "intro": "Thelypteris heterocarpos var. glaucostipes, commonly known as the glaucous-stemmed water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Thelypteris. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forest understories. Its leaves are usually covered with a waxy, bluish-green coating, which helps reduce water loss in its wet habitat. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in aquatic gardens."
