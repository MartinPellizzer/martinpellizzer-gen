    "intro": "Thymus lotocephalus, commonly known as the Greek thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant leaves that are densely packed on creeping stems, often forming a mat-like growth habit. The plant produces tiny, pink or purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its aromatic foliage contains essential oils, making it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications. Thymus lotocephalus is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, thriving in full sun conditions."
