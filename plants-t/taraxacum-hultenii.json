    "intro": "Taraxacum hultenii, commonly known as Hult\u00e9n's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. This perennial herb is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces seeds with pappus, which are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation across rocky and alpine habitats. Taraxacum hultenii is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude environments where it thrives in well-drained soils."
