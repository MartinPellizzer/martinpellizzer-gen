    "intro": "Tillandsia copalaensis, commonly known as the Copala airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale purple. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
