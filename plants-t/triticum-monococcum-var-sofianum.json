    "intro": "Triticum monococcum var. sofianum, commonly known as the Sofian wheat, is a rare and ancient variety of wheat native to the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, hard grains and compact plant structure, which makes it well-suited for dry and arid environments. The plant typically grows to a height of about 50-80 cm, with narrow leaves and a short stem. It produces a dense spike of florets, which are covered in a tough, inedible hull. This variety is of interest to botanists and researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and its historical significance in early agriculture."
