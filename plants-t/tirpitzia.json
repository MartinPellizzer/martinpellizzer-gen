    "intro": "Tirpitzia, commonly known as the rock cress, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are typically small, herbaceous, and often grow in rocky or alpine environments. They are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, cruciform flowers. Tirpitzia species are generally found in temperate regions and are adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor soils. Their botanical features make them important components of ecosystems in mountainous and coastal areas."
