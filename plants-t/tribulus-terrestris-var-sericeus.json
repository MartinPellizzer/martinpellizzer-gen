    "intro": "Tribulus terrestris var. sericeus, commonly known as velvet bindweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features hairy, sprawling stems and trifoliate leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into red, three-lobed berries. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in dry, sunny areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain environments."
