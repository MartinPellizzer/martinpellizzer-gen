    "intro": "Tragopogon colchicus, commonly known as the Colchic thistle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, showy yellow flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem that is often used as a container for storing water, a feature adapted to its arid habitats. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Tragopogon colchicus is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is known for its resilience in harsh environmental conditions."
