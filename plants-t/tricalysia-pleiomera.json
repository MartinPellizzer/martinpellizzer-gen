    "intro": "Tricalysia pleiomera, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and Eastern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, flame-orange inflorescences that appear in clusters during the flowering season. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators. Its rapid growth rate and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
