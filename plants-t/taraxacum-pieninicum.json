    "intro": "Taraxacum pieninicum, commonly known as the Pienin dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a long, hollow stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant is native to the Pieniny Mountains in Slovakia and is adapted to rocky, alpine environments. It produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native region."
