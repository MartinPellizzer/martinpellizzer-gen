    "intro": "Tricarpha durangensis, commonly known as Durango burrobrush, is a shrub native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Tricarpha durangensis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
