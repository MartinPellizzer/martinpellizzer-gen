    "intro": "Trevoria escobariana, commonly known as the Escobaria trevorii, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure with fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Trevoria escobariana is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive in harsh environments. It is often found in rocky soils and is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
