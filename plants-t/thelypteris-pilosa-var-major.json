    "intro": "Thelypteris pilosa var. major, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while the sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in its habitat."
