    "intro": "Torrubia venosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved torylus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Torrubia venosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
