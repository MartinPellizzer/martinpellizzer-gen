    "intro": "Tunica thessala var. cyrenaica, commonly known as the Cyrenaica tunica, is a rare and specialized plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
