    "intro": "Tillandsia tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white trichomes on its leaves, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. The plant lacks traditional roots and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves from the air. It thrives in humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
