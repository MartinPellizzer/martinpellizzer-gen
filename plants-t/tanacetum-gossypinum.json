    "intro": "Tanacetum gossypinum, commonly known as the woolly tansy, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. Its small, yellow flower heads are arranged in flat-topped clusters, and it produces a strong, aromatic scent. Tanacetum gossypinum is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
