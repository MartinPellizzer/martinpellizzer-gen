    "intro": "Turpinia montana, commonly known as the mountain turpentine shrub, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of turpentine. Turpinia montana thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and historical contexts."
