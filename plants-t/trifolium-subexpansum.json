    "intro": "Trifolium subexpansum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which typically consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Trifolium subexpansum is also valued for its role in pastureland and as a forage crop."
