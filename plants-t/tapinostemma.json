    "intro": "Tapinostemma, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is native to various regions in Africa and is characterized by its milky sap, which is often toxic. The plants typically have opposite, ovate leaves and produce showy, tubular flowers in shades of yellow or orange. Tapinostemma species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. They are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though their toxic properties require caution in handling."
