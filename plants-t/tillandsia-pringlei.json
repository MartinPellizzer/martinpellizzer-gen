    "intro": "Tillandsia pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is native to the Andes Mountains in South America, where it thrives in humid, high-altitude environments. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia pringlei is appreciated for its unique appearance and air-purifying properties."
