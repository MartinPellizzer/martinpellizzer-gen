    "intro": "Terminalia argyrophylla, commonly known as silverleaf terminalia, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, silvery-gray bark and elliptical leaves that turn yellow before shedding in the dry season. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for local use."
