    "intro": "Turbinicarpus \u00d7 amoenulus nothosubsp. camelliflorus, commonly known as the camelliflorus hybrid, is a rare and unique cactus species resulting from the cross between Turbinicarpus amoenulus and Turbinicarpus camelliflorus. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that often develop a thick, waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. It is native to the arid regions of northern Mexico and requires well-drained soil and minimal water. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and challenging species to cultivate."
