    "intro": "Taraxacum holophyllum, commonly known as the Alpine dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and a tall, slender stem that bears a single yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, wind-dispersed seed stem, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in rocky, alpine, and subalpine habitats, often growing at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
