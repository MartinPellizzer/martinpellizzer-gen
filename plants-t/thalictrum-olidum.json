    "intro": "Thalictrum olidum, commonly known as the stinking beggar's-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, nodding flowers that appear in early spring. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent stamens. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Thalictrum olidum is notable for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is thought to attract specific pollinators."
