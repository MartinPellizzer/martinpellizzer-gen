    "intro": "Trimorpha lonchophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted for attachment to its host. It is found in various regions of Europe and is often associated with grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat."
