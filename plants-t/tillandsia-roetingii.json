    "intro": "Tillandsia roetingii, commonly known as the Roetingii air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, fibrous roots and rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it capture moisture from the air. Its leaves are typically gray-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
