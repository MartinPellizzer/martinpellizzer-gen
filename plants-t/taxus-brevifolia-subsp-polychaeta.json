    "intro": "Taxus brevifolia subsp. polychaeta, commonly known as the Pacific yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces distinctive red, berry-like cones that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, orange aril. It is notable for its taxane-rich bark and foliage, which have historically been used in the production of the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel. This subspecies is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
