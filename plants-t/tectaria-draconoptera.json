    "intro": "Tectaria draconoptera, commonly known as the dragon's wing fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Tectaria draconoptera is often found in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests."
