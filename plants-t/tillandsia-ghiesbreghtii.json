    "intro": "Tillandsia ghiesbreghtii, commonly known as the Ghiesbreght's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. This species is adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to thrive."
