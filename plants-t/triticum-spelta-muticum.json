    "intro": "Triticum spelta muticum, commonly known as wild rye, is a grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous\u9896\u82b1, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop."
