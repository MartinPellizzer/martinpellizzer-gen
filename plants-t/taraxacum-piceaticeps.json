    "intro": "Taraxacum piceaticeps, commonly known as the purple ray floret dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright purple ray florets, which distinguish it from the more commonly known yellow dandelions. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stem is usually unbranched and upright. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
