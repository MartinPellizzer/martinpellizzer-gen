    "intro": "Trifolium pratense proles bracteatum, commonly known as the bracted clover, is a variant of red clover characterized by its bract-like structures on the stems. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows and grasslands. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers in dense clusters, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a distinct white or pale marking. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
