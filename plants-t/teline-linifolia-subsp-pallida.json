    "intro": "Teline linifolia subsp. pallida, commonly known as the pale leaf teline, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pale blue or white flowers in late spring. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Teline genus, which are known for their aromatic foliage and drought tolerance."
