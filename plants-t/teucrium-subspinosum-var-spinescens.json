It features erect, branched stems covered in stiff, spiny hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, arranged in whorled clusters along the stem. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy surface. This species is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
