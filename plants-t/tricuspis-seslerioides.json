    "intro": "Tricuspis seslerioides, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, helping it to retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Tricuspis seslerioides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
