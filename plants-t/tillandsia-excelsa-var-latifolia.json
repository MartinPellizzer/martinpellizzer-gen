    "intro": "Tillandsia excelsa var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that can reach up to several feet in length, often forming a rosette shape. Its flowers are typically purple or pink and bloom in clusters at the end of the plant. This variety is well adapted to humid environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth."
