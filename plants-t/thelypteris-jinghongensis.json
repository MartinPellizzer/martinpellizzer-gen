    "intro": "Thelypteris jinghongensis, commonly known as the Jinghong holly fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
