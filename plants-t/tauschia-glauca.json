    "intro": "Tauschia glauca, commonly known as the blue tauschia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, blue to violet flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Tauschia glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in horticultural settings."
