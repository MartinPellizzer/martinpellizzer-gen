    "intro": "Thelypteris melanorachis, commonly known as the black-stemmed shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its dark, wiry rhizomes and leathery, lanceolate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds. Thelypteris melanorachis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
