It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are thin and papery in texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries. Talisia chartacea is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
