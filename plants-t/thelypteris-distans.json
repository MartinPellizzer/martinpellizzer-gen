    "intro": "Thelypteris distans, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Thelypteris distans has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and colonize various substrates effectively."
