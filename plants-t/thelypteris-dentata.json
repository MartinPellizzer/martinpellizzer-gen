    "intro": "Thelypteris dentata, commonly known as the serrated maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely toothed fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. Thelypteris dentata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
