    "intro": "Trigonia eriosperma, commonly known as the hairy bladder grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in distinctive, inflated seed pods that help in dispersal. Trigonia eriosperma is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
