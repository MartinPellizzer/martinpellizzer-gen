    "intro": "Trachymene crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved false solomon's seal, is a herbaceous perennial native to Australia. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Trachymene crassifolia is often found in moist, shaded areas such as rainforests and understoreys."
