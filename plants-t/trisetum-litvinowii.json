    "intro": "Trisetum litvinowii, commonly known as the Litvinow's feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments. Trisetum litvinowii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
