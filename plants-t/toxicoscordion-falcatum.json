    "intro": "Toxicoscordion falcatum, commonly known as the death camas, is a toxic perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant contains potent neurotoxins, primarily in its bulbs and seeds, making it highly dangerous to both humans and animals. It is often mistaken for edible plants like wild onions or garlic, leading to accidental poisoning. Due to its toxicity and resemblance to edible species, it is considered a significant plant poison in regions where it is found."
