    "intro": "Tulipa sylvestris var. biflora, commonly known as the woodland tulip, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, cup-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or loamy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its bulbs are adapted to survive harsh winters, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. The varietal name \"biflora\" refers to its tendency to produce two flowers per stem, a distinctive feature that sets it apart from other tulip varieties."
