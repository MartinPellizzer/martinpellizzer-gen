    "intro": "Thelypteris centrochinensis, commonly known as the Chinese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its rhizomes are somewhat thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in forest ecosystems."
