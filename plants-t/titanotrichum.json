    "intro": "Titanotrichum, commonly known as the \"giant hairplant,\" is a genus of mosses belonging to the family Dicranaceae. These plants are characterized by their tall, grass-like appearance and are often found in moist, shaded environments. Titanotrichum species typically have wiry stems and are known for their dense, hairy growth patterns. They play an important role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in their ecosystems. Due to their unique morphology, they are of interest to botanists studying moss diversity and adaptation."
