    "intro": "Taraxacum interruptum, commonly known as the interrupted dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its flowers produce small, wind-dispersed seeds with white pappus, aiding in its spread. The species is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other sunny areas where it can compete effectively with other vegetation."
