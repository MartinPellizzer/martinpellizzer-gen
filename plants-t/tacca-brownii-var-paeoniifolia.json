    "intro": "Tacca brownii var. paeoniifolia, commonly known as the peacock plant or sacred lotus, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, violet-blue bracts that resemble the tail of a peacock, which are not actual flowers but modified leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the evening, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, rich soil to flourish. This plant is often cultivated for its dramatic appearance and cultural significance in traditional medicine and rituals."
