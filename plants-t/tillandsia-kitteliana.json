    "intro": "Tillandsia kitteliana, commonly known as the Kittel's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can trap moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of white or pale pink. Tillandsia kitteliana is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright indirect light and regular misting to thrive."
