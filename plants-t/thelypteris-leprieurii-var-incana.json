    "intro": "Thelypteris leprieurii var. incana, commonly known as the silky water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Thelypteris. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a silvery, fuzzy layer of trichomes. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its leaves. The silky texture of its fronds gives it a distinctive appearance, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
