It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and bright white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, but has been introduced to many other regions around the world. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered both a weed and a valuable forage plant for livestock."
