    "intro": "Tuberolabium coarctatum, commonly known as the narrow-lipped tuberous orchid, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tuberous roots, which serve as storage organs for nutrients and water. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers with a unique lip structure that is adapted for pollination by specific insects. Its leaves are typically broad and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in moisture retention. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
