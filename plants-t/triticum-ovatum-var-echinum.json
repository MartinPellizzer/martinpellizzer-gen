    "intro": "Triticum ovatum var. echinum, commonly known as the echinated wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, grass-like foliage with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. This variety is often found in alpine environments and is valued for its hardiness and ecological resilience."
