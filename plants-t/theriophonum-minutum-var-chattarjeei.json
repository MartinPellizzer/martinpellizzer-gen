    "intro": "Theriophonum minutum var. chattarjeei, commonly known as the Chattarjee's dwarf thistle, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The flowering period occurs in late summer, producing small yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
