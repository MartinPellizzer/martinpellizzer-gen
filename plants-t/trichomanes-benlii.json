    "intro": "Trichomanes benlii, commonly known as the Benli's maidenhair, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or on rocky surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sori and sporangia, are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
