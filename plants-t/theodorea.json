It belongs to the Nelumbonaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, buoyant stalks. The plant's leaves are broad and floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Theodorea is notable for its ability to thrive in still water, making it a common sight in ponds and lakes. Its symbolic significance in various cultures further highlights its botanical and cultural importance."
