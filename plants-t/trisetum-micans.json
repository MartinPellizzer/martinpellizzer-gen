    "intro": "Trisetum micans, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that shimmers in the light, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in open woodlands or meadows. Its inflorescence consists of slender, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing stems. Trisetum micans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense, low-growing turf-like mats."
