    "intro": "Taraxacum prionum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that terminates in a flowering head. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seed heads, which are dispersed by the wind. It is native to Europe but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. Taraxacum prionum is known for its medicinal properties and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed soils."
