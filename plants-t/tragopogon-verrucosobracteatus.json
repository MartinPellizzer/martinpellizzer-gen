    "intro": "Tragopogon verrucosobracteatus, commonly known as the hairy bract goat's beard, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and a distinctive crown of bracts that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces yellow ray florets surrounded by a dense cluster of disk florets, typical of the genus Tragopogon. It is native to North America and thrives in disturbed soils, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptability, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
