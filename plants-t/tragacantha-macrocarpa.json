    "intro": "Tragacantha macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and palmate leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods that contain numerous seeds. Tragacantha macrocarpa is known for its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodland habitats. Its latex, which is milky and viscous, has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural gum."
