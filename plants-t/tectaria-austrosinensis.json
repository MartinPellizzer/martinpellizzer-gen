    "intro": "Tectaria austrosinensis, commonly known as the southern China shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
