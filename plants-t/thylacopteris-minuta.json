    "intro": "Thylacopteris minuta, commonly known as the minute thylacopteris, is a small fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thylacopteris minuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
