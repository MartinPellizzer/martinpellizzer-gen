    "intro": "Tetrapilus brachiatus, commonly known as the branched-stemmed fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and the presence of multiple branching stems. The plant produces small, clustered fronds with a distinctive, often serrated margin. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Tetrapilus brachiatus thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in tropical and subtropical forests."
