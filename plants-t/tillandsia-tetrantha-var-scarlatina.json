    "intro": "Tillandsia tetrantha var. scarlatina, commonly known as the red-tipped air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and minerals through its leaves. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in capturing water and light. Its striking red or orange flower bracts make it a visually distinctive species, often cultivated for ornamental purposes. It thrives in humid, well-lit environments and requires regular misting to maintain its health."
