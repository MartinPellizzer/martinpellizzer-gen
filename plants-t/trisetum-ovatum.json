    "intro": "Trisetum ovatum, commonly known as the oval spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands and marshy areas of North America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical inflorescence that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Trisetum ovatum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various small aquatic organisms."
