    "intro": "Thelythamnos, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of tubular, fragrant flowers. The leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a silvery or grayish underside, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of pink, purple, or white, are adapted for pollination by hummingbirds and bees. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
