    "intro": "Trophaeum crenatum, commonly known as the crested rock-cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in harsh, arid conditions. Its distinctive feature is the presence of a crest or ridge along the stem, which gives it its common name. Trophaeum crenatum is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
