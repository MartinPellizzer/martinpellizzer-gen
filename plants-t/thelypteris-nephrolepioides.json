    "intro": "Thelypteris nephrolepioides, commonly known as the broadleaf water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lobed fronds that are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Thelypteris nephrolepioides plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms."
