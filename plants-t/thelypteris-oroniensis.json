    "intro": "Thelypteris oroniensis, commonly known as the Oroni shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that form a dense, compact crown. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Thelypteris oroniensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens for its unique foliage."
