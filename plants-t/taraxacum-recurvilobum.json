    "intro": "Taraxacum recurvilobum, commonly known as the recurved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, recurved leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to North America and thrives in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and open fields. Its flowers develop into spherical, white pappus-bearing seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. Taraxacum recurvilobum is often mistaken for other dandelion species but can be distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences."
