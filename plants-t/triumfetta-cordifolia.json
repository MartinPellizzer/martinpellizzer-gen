    "intro": "Triumfetta cordifolia, commonly known as heartleaf triumfetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are often eaten by birds and other animals, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas, woodlands, and disturbed sites. Triumfetta cordifolia is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
