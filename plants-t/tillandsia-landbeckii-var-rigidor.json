    "intro": "Tillandsia landbeckii var. rigidor, commonly known as the rigid tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped foliage that is covered in a layer of fine, white trichomes. These trichomes help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, and its leaves are often stiff and upright. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its overall appearance."
