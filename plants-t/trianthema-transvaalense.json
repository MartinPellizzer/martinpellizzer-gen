It is a succulent shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and thick, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments by storing water in its leaves and stems.
