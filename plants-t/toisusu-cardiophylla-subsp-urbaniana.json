    "intro": "Toisusu cardiophylla subsp. urbaniana, commonly known as the Urbanian heartleaf, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific microhabitats within its native range. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are typically broad and glossy, with a deep green coloration. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer months. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and taxonomic studies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
