    "intro": "Themeda echinata, commonly known as the serrated grass or black grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and narrow, bluish-green leaves with prominent serrations along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Themeda echinata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna."
