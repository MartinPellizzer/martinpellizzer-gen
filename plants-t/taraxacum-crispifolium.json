    "intro": "Taraxacum crispifolium, commonly known as the curlyleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of deeply lobed, wavy-edged leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces a single, hollow, leaf-like stem that terminates in a bright yellow flower head composed of numerous tiny florets. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
