    "intro": "Taraxacum piceatifrons, commonly known as the purple-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, dark green to purple-tinged leaves. The plant produces a single, hollow, hairless stem that terminates in a composite flower head, which develops into a spherical seed ball known as a pappus. It is native to central and eastern Europe and is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage."
