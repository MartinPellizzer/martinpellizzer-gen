    "intro": "Tertrea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, ephemeral blooms that appear only at night. The plant's flowers are pale purple or white, with a delicate, almost translucent appearance. Tertrea is known for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments, often found in rainforests. Its botanical significance lies in its rare flowering pattern and ecological role in supporting nocturnal pollinators."
