It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, thriving in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are basal, rosette-shaped, and covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and produce a wind-dispersed seed head. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its habitat."
