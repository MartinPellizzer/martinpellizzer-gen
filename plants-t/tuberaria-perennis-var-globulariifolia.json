    "intro": "Tuberaria perennis var. globulariifolia, commonly known as the globular-leaved tuberaria, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and hairy, fleshy leaves that are typically rounded or globular in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its unique foliage and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
