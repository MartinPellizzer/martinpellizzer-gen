    "intro": "Triglochin striata var. filifolia, commonly known as the filifoliated marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features slender, thread-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, often emerging from the base of the leaves. It thrives in moist to submerged soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important component of aquatic and wetland ecosystems."
