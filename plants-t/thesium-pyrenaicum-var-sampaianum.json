    "intro": "Thesium pyrenaicum var. sampaianum, commonly known as the Pyrenean thesium, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and evergreen foliage. The plant typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and heathlands. Its flowers are small, clustered, and usually pink or red, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
