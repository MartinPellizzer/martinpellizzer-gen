    "intro": "Thelypteris ophiorhizoma, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the forest floor. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and they often have a bluish-green hue. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common understory plant in tropical and subtropical forests. The plant's ability to form dense mats helps in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
