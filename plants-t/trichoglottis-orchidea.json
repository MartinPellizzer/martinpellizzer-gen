    "intro": "Trichoglottis orchidea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and captivating epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves and its striking, delicate flowers that often resemble ghostly shapes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, a feature common among epiphytic species. Due to its unique appearance and habitat requirements, it is a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern."
