It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a compact, herbaceous growth habit. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, and it blooms during the short summer season in its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, it is considered a vulnerable species."
