    "intro": "Tillandsia portillae, commonly known as the Portilla air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a rosette that traps moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive."
