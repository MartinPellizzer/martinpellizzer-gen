It features delicate, fern-like compound leaves that are finely divided and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on tall, slender stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value lies in its lush foliage and subtle floral display, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
