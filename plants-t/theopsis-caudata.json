    "intro": "Theopsis caudata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, featuring silver-gray foliage and yellow composite flowers. The plant has a compact rosette structure with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Theopsis caudata is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
