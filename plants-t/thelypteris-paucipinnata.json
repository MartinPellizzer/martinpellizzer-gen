    "intro": "Thelypteris paucipinnata, commonly known as the few-pinnate water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help in water retention. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a feathery appearance."
