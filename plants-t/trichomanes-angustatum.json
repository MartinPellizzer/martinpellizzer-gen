    "intro": "Trichomanes angustatum, commonly known as narrow fern or slender harts-tongue fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its narrow, elongated fronds that are often curled or rolled. The plant typically grows on damp, shaded rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, tropical environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common in many ferns. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
