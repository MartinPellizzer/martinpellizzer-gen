    "intro": "Trifolium serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated clover, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Trifolium serrulatum is a member of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
