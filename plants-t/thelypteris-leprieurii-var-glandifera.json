    "intro": "Thelypteris leprieurii var. glandifera, commonly known as the glandular fern, is a variant of the slender wood fern. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered with glandular hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. This fern is native to parts of Asia and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
