    "intro": "Tradescantia commelinoides var. glabrata, commonly known as spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and its ability to thrive in moist, shady environments. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the varietal name \"glabrata\" suggests a smooth, hairless surface. It produces showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This species is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of cultivation."
