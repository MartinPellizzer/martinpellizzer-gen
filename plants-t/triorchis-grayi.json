    "intro": "Triorchis grayi, commonly known as the Gray's twayblade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with two opposing leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
