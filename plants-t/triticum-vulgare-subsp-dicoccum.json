    "intro": "Triticum vulgare subsp. dicoccum, commonly known as emmer wheat, is an ancient grain species native to the Fertile Crescent. It is characterized by its tough, hull-covered grains that remain attached to the spikelet, distinguishing it from modern wheat varieties. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and compact spikelets containing multiple florets. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces achenes as its reproductive structures. Emmer wheat is notable for its high protein content and has been cultivated for thousands of years in various parts of the world."
