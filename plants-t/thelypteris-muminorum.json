    "intro": "Thelypteris muminorum, commonly known as the Mumin's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that sets it apart from other ferns. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps anchor it to substrates and absorb nutrients. Thelypteris muminorum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
