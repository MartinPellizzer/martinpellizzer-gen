    "intro": "Taraxacum vetteri, commonly known as the Vetter's dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and covered in fine pubescence. Its flowering stems rise from the center of the rosette, bearing a single yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy white pappus for wind dispersal. Taraxacum vetteri is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows."
