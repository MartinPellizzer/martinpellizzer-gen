It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are usually bright green and often have a slightly glossy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris denudata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
