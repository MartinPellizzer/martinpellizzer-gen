    "intro": "Tapinanthus aurantiacus, commonly known as the orange dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellow-orange flowers and has a tangled, vine-like appearance. The plant is native to parts of Africa and is often found growing on various host species, including shrubs and trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can form dense mats on its host, potentially affecting its growth. The plant's unique biology and striking color make it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
