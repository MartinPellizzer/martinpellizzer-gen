    "intro": "Taraxacum serotinum subsp. haussknechtii, commonly known as the late-flowering dandelion, is a perennial herb native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head that blooms later in the growing season compared to other dandelion species. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem with a milky sap that is typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. Its botanical features make it a notable species within the genus Taraxacum."
