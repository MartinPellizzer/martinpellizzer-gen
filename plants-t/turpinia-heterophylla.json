    "intro": "Turpinia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf turpinia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Oleaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves ranging from elliptic to ovate in shape. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by yellowish fruits that are edible for certain bird species. Turpinia heterophylla is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
