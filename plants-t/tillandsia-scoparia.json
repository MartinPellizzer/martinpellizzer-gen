    "intro": "Tillandsia scoparia, commonly known as the silver vulture orchid, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, silver-white foliage that gives it its common name and helps it reflect sunlight. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters and are typically short-lived. Tillandsia scoparia is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity for optimal growth."
