    "intro": "Tectaria stenosemioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tectaria, is a fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a loose, weeping habit. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for studying fern morphology and ecological adaptation."
