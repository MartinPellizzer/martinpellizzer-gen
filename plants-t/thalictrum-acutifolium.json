    "intro": "Thalictrum acutifolium, commonly known as the sharp-leaved meadow-rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and often have a silvery underside. The plant produces showy, clustered clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream sides. Thalictrum acutifolium is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
