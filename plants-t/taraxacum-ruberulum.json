It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and distinctive reddish veins on its leaves. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces a capsule that releases numerous seeds with feathery parachutes. It is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
