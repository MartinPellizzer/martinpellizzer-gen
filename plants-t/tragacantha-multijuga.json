    "intro": "Tragacantha multijuga, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a thick, resinous gum that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Tragacantha multijuga is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and its economic importance in the production of gum arabic."
