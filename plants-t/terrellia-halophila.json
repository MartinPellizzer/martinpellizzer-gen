    "intro": "Terrellia halophila, commonly known as the salt marsh terrellia, is a small flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is adapted to grow in saline environments, such as salt marshes and tidal flats, and exhibits specialized mechanisms to tolerate high salt concentrations. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss and salt absorption. Terrellia halophila plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity."
