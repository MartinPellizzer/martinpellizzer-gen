    "intro": "Tragacantha prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate tragacanth, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features a sprawling habit with multiple stems that lie close to the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Tragacantha prostrata is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes."
