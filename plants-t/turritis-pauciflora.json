    "intro": "Turritis pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered turritis, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, often arranged in whorls along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of its native habitat. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
