    "intro": "Taraxacum facetum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single flowering head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, typical of the Compositae family. It produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus, which consists of feathery bristles. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, and it is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
