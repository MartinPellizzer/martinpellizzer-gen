    "intro": "Tillandsia pulchella var. surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup to collect rainwater. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, and it produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique ability to thrive in humid environments."
