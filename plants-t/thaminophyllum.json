    "intro": "Thaminophyllum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Thaminophyllum has a unique reproductive system, producing sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Its conservation status is threatened due to habitat loss and over-collection for ornamental purposes."
