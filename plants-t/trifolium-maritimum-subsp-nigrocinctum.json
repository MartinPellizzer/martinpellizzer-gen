    "intro": "Trifolium maritimum subsp. nigrocinctum, commonly known as the black-banded clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically dark green with a distinctive black or dark purple band around the leaflets. The plant produces small, pink to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, and it thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the coast. It is often found in maritime environments, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
