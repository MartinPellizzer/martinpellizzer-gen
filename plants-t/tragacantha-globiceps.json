    "intro": "Tragacantha globiceps, commonly known as the globular tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive globular or spherical shape, which is formed by the dense arrangement of its leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its arid native habitat. Tragacantha globiceps is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its mucilage-rich properties."
