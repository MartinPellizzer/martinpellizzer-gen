    "intro": "Tubella todziae, commonly known as the Todziae tubular sponge, is a unique marine sponge found in shallow tropical waters. It belongs to the order Tubellaria and is characterized by its elongated, tubular body structure. The sponge's surface is covered with small, finger-like projections called stereopyles, which aid in filter feeding. It thrives in environments with strong water currents, allowing it to capture planktonic organisms efficiently. This species is notable for its simple yet effective structure, reflecting the evolutionary adaptations of sponges to aquatic life."
