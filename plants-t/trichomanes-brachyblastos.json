    "intro": "Trichomanes brachyblastos, commonly known as the broad-leaved harts-tongue fern, is a member of the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in shaded, humid environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and its fronds are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called soruses on the underside of its fronds. This species is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas."
