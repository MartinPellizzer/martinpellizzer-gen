    "intro": "Tenorea berteroi, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and smooth, reddish bark. The plant is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and furniture-making. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in dry, sandy soils. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
