    "intro": "Theopsis elongata, commonly known as the elongated pincushion cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a small, columnar cactus characterized by its dense, spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Theopsis elongata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
