    "intro": "Thelypteris decipiens, commonly known as the false holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that resemble those of the holly plant, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. Thelypteris decipiens is often found in the eastern United States and parts of Southeast Asia."
