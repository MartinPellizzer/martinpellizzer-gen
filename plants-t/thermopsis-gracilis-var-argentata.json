    "intro": "Thermopsis gracilis var. argentata, commonly known as silverleaf narrowleaf thermopsis, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and finely divided, silver-gray foliage that reflects light, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
