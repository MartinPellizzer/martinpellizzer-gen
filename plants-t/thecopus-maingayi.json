    "intro": "Thecopus maingayi, commonly known as the Malayan water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Thecopus maingayi plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
