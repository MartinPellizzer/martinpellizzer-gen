    "intro": "Trachomitum venetum subsp. scabrum, commonly known as the rough trachomitum, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its rough, textured leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky or wooded areas. Its gametophyte stage is the dominant phase of its life cycle, with the sporophyte being short-lived and dependent on the gametophyte. This subspecies is notable for its ecological adaptability and is often used in studies related to liverwort morphology and ecology."
