    "intro": "Thuja flagelliformis, commonly known as the hairpin wheatgrass, is a unique evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves that grow in spirals, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant forms dense, shrub-like clusters and can reach heights of up to 3 meters. Its cones are small and usually borne on the branches, and it produces both male and female cones on the same plant. Thuja flagelliformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy and adaptable nature."
