    "intro": "Trachyrhynchium iridifolium, commonly known as the blue leaf fern, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that display a unique iridescent blue hue under certain light conditions. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive, curled appearance, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
