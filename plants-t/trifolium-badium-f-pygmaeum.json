    "intro": "Trifolium badium f. pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf red clover, is a subspecies of the red clover plant characterized by its smaller stature and compact growth habit. It is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant features trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a slight reddish hue, and produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes cultivated for ecological and agricultural purposes."
