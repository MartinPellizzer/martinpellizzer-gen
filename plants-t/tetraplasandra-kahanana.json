    "intro": "Tetraplasandra kahanana, commonly known as the Kahananui tree, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of Hawaii. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels and avocado trees, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and aromatic properties. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with smooth, dark-barked trunks and glossy, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by dark, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for native wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tetraplasandra kahanana is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species."
