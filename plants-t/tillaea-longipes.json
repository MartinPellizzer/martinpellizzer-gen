    "intro": "Tillaea longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed tillaea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, which includes buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive waxy coating to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Tillaea longipes is adapted to survive in extreme conditions, making it an important component of desert ecosystems."
