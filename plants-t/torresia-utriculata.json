    "intro": "Torresia utriculata, commonly known as the bladder orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like structure in the flower, which is a specialized adaptation for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and wetlands. Its leaves are long and narrow, often forming a rosette at the base. Torresia utriculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators."
