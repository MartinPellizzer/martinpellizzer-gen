    "intro": "Tissa coquimbensis, commonly known as the Coquimbo thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Chile. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, robust stems and yellow flowers. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in coastal areas. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Tissa coquimbensis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
