It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are often hairy and covered in a white waxy coating. Its flowering stems produce a single, showy yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy white pappus for wind dispersal. The species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and efficient water use strategies."
