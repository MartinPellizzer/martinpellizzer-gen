    "intro": "Tilia pseudorubra, commonly known as the white betony, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
