    "intro": "Terminalia baumii, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round, fleshy fruits that are edible and often consumed by local communities. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly waxy texture. Terminalia baumii is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological and potential medicinal uses."
