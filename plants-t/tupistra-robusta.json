    "intro": "Tupistra robusta, commonly known as the African snowball, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are leathery and arranged in a rosette pattern, providing a compact, attractive appearance. Tupistra robusta is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained soils."
