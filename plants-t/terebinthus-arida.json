    "intro": "Terebinthus arida, commonly known as the desert terebinth, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody capsule that opens to release the seeds when dry. Terebinthus arida is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
