    "intro": "Terminalia alata f. velutina, commonly known as the velvet terminalia, is a variant of the Terminalia alata species native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, velvety bark, which gives it its common name. The plant is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub with simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces edible, fleshy berries that are often consumed by local communities. The botanical features of this plant make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts."
