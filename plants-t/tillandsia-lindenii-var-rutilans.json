    "intro": "Tillandsia lindenii var. rutilans, commonly known as the golden tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup to collect water. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its vibrant green leaves often have a golden or reddish hue, especially under bright light, making it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in humid environments with indirect sunlight and requires regular misting to maintain its health."
