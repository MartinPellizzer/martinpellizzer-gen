It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, making it important in local crafts and traditional medicine. Terminalia splendida also plays a role in supporting local wildlife, providing food and habitat for various species."
