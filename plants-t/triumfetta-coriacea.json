    "intro": "Triumfetta coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf triumfetta, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats. Triumfetta coriacea is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
