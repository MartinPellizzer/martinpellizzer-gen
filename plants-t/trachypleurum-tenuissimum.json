    "intro": "Trachypleurum tenuissimum, commonly known as the slender pleurothallid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and its unique, elongated flower spike that bears a single, fragrant bloom. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and thrives in high humidity and shade. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
