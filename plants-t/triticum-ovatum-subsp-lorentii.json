    "intro": "Triticum ovatum subsp. lorentii, commonly known as the Lorenti's wheatgrass, is a rare and lesser-known subspecies of wheatgrass native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, elongated leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions and high sunlight exposure. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a short, compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
