    "intro": "Tounatea conferta, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by dark, round berries. Tounatea conferta is valued for its dense, aromatic wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its natural range."
