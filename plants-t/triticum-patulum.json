    "intro": "Triticum patulum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered spikelets. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or sandy environments. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a reproductive structure that produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Triticum patulum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
