    "intro": "Trigonostemon calcicola, commonly known as the limestone trigonostemon, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in calcium-rich soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Trigonostemon calcicola is valued for its ornamental potential and its role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes."
