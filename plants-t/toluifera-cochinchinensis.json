    "intro": "Toluifera cochinchinensis, commonly known as the Vietnamese sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, pale yellow wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by green, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
