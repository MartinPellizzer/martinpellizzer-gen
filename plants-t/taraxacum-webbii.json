    "intro": "Taraxacum webbii, commonly known as the Webb's dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, typical of the dandelion genus. It produces a distinctive seed head with parachute-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is native to southern Africa and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils."
