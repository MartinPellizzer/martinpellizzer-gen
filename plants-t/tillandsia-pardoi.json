    "intro": "Tillandsia pardoi, commonly known as the \"Pardoi air plant,\" is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking violet to purple inflorescences with showy flowers. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
