    "intro": "Triticum compactum var. recognitum, commonly known as the dwarf wheat or compact wheat, is a variety of wheat characterized by its short stature and dense growth habit. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is native to the Mediterranean region. This plant typically produces small, hard grains that are well-suited for certain agricultural conditions. It is often used in breeding programs to improve disease resistance and adaptability in wheat crops. Its compact form makes it less prone to lodging, which is a common issue in taller wheat varieties."
