    "intro": "Tillandsia ensifolia, commonly known as the sword air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical and subtropical environments. The plant has long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting or soaking to maintain proper hydration. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
