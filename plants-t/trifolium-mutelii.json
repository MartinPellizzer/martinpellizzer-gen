    "intro": "Trifolium mutelii, commonly known as the Mutel's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, contributing to its ornamental value. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. Trifolium mutelii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
