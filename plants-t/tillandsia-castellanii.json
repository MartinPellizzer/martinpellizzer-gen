    "intro": "Tillandsia castellanii, commonly known as the Castellani's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect and retain water. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, delicate inflorescences. Tillandsia castellanii is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
