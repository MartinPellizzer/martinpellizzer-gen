It is characterized by its distinctive, multi-stemmed trunk that branches out into a candelabra-like structure. The tree produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody pods containing elliptical seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and typically elliptical with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
