    "intro": "Thlaspi fendleri, commonly known as the desert cabbages, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are typically lobed and somewhat hairy. Thlaspi fendleri is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. It is often found growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds."
