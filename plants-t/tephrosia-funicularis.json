    "intro": "Tephrosia funicularis, commonly known as the climbing tephrosia, is a perennial legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its twining stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and have a distinct appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Tephrosia funicularis is also valued for its potential use in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
