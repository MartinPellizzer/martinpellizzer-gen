    "intro": "Taraxacum crocellum, commonly known as the crooked dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of deeply lobed, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, tall flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk florets, which are typically yellow in color. It produces a distinctive, spiral-shaped seed head that releases lightweight seeds with pappus for wind dispersal. This species is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, showcasing its adaptability to various environmental conditions."
