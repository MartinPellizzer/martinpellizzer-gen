    "intro": "Tetrameris stenodon, commonly known as the narrow-toothed tetrameris, is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense heads, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
