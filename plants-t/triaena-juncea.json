    "intro": "Triaena juncea, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. Triaena juncea is often found in sandy soils and is considered an indicator species for disturbed or degraded habitats."
