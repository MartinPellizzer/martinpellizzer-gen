    "intro": "Teucrium compactum, commonly known as creeping tarragon, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in summer. Its aromatic leaves have a distinctive, slightly minty scent and are used in traditional herbal medicine. Teucrium compactum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and borders."
