    "intro": "Thalictrum actaeifolium var. brevistylum, commonly known as the short-stemmed meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces showy, spire-like clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
