    "intro": "Tillandsia adamsii, commonly known as the Adams' air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks. The plant features dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, water-repellent trichome layer, which helps it absorb moisture from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming once in its lifetime. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
