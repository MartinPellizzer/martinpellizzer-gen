    "intro": "Taraxacum uniforme, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. After flowering, it produces a distinctive seed head, or \"puffball,\" which releases seeds with white, feathery parachutes. This species is widespread across temperate regions and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed soils."
