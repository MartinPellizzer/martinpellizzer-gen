    "intro": "Thalictrum dunnianum, commonly known as the Dunn's meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. It produces follicles as its fruit type, which release seeds through a mechanism involving elaiosomes to attract ants for dispersal. Thalictrum dunnianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
