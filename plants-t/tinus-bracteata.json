    "intro": "Tinus bracteata, commonly known as the Cape chestnut, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, chestnut-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Its ornamental value and hardy nature make it a popular choice for landscaping in Mediterranean climates."
