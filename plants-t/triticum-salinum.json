    "intro": "Triticum salinum, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its salt-tolerant nature, allowing it to thrive in saline soils where many other plants cannot survive. The plant typically grows in dense mats or tufts, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt crystals. Its small, spikelet-based inflorescence contains both male and female flowers, making it monoecious. Triticum salinum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in harsh environments."
