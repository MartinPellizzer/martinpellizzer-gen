    "intro": "Tilia tomentosa var. inaequalis, commonly known as the woolly lime or the unequal-leaf lime, is a variant of the small-leaf linden. It is characterized by its dense, woolly pubescence on young shoots and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a serrated margin and are often unequal in size along the petiole, hence its botanical name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
