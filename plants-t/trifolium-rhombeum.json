    "intro": "Trifolium rhombeum, commonly known as the heartleaf clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a heart-like pattern. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in meadows and grasslands. It produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Trifolium rhombeum is also valued for its role in ecological systems and as a forage plant for livestock."
