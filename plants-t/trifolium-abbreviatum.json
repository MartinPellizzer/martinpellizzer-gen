    "intro": "Trifolium abbreviatum, commonly known as the short-stemmed clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Trifolium abbreviatum is a member of the legume family, capable of nitrogen fixation through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules."
