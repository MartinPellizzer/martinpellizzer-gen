It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous roots. The plant produces a distinctive yellow flower that develops into a white, fluffy seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in several regions."
