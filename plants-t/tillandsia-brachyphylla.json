    "intro": "Tillandsia brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-stemmed air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage forms dense rosettes that trap moisture, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. The plant produces striking inflorescences with violet or purple flowers, which attract pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
