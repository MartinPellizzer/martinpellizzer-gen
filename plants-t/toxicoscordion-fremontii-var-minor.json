    "intro": "Toxicoscordion fremontii var. minor, commonly known as the lesser death camas, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, particularly those in its bulbous corms, making it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. It thrives in wet meadows and marshy areas, often forming dense colonies. Due to its toxicity, it is important to avoid ingestion and handle it with care."
