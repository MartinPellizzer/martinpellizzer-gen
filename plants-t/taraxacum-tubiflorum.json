    "intro": "Taraxacum tubiflorum, commonly known as the woolly dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, and often sticky stem that supports its flowering head. It is typically found in grassy areas and disturbed soils across temperate regions. Its life cycle includes a period of dormancy during the winter, with the plant resuming growth in the spring."
