    "intro": "Tillandsia grisebachiana, commonly known as the Gray's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Tillandsia grisebachiana is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal care when grown in suitable conditions."
