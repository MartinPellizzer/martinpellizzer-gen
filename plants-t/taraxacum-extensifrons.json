    "intro": "Taraxacum extensifrons, commonly known as the broad-fringed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that produces a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of northern Africa, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a pappus, which is a feathery structure that aids in aerial distribution. The species is notable for its distinctive, elongated pappus and its role in supporting pollinators in its native range."
