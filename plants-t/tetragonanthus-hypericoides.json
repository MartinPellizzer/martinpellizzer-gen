The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer and early fall. Its growth habit is low and sprawling, often forming dense mats on moist, well-drained soils. The botanical characteristics of Tetragonanthus hypericoides make it a valuable species for wetland restoration and ecological landscaping."
