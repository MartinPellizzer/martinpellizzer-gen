    "intro": "Taraxacum glaucophylloides, commonly known as the glaucophylloides dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate, glaucous-blue leaves that are covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces a single, hollow, spiky stem that terminates in a flower head composed of numerous yellow ray florets. It is typically found in moist, temperate regions and is often seen in meadows and along stream banks. This species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal."
