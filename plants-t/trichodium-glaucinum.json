    "intro": "Trichodium glaucinum, commonly known as the glaucous trichodium, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers, which bloom in summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a powdery, waxy coating that gives them a bluish-gray appearance. Trichodium glaucinum is often found in disturbed habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions."
