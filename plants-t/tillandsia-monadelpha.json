    "intro": "Tillandsia monadelpha, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Mexico and Central America. It thrives by attaching itself to trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces rather than through roots. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in capturing water and light. It produces striking inflorescences with long, spathaceous bracts and showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular ornamental plant among bromeliad enthusiasts."
