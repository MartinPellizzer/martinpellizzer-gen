    "intro": "Tragium eriocarpum, commonly known as the woolly globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are inflated, membranous pods that split open to release the seeds. Tragium eriocarpum is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats."
