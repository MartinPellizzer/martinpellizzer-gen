    "intro": "Taraxacum vulgare var. dens-leonis, commonly known as the dense-leaved dandelion, is a variant of the common dandelion characterized by its densely packed, often overlapping leaves. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. The plant produces a single, hollow stem that supports a bright yellow flower head, which develops into a white, fluffy seed sphere. Its leaves are usually more robust and arranged in a basal rosette, distinguishing it from other dandelion varieties. This variant is often used in herbal medicine for its lactucin and other bioactive compounds."
