    "intro": "Tithymalus maresii, commonly known as the Maresii tithymalus, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
