    "intro": "Turbinicarpus krainzianus subsp. minimus, commonly known as the miniature turbinicarpus, is a small, stemless cactus native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a compact, globular body covered in short, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stem. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
