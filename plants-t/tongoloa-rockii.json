    "intro": "Tongoloa rockii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that often grow in a compact, clustered formation. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found on rocky outcrops or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, Tongoloa rockii is often valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal."
