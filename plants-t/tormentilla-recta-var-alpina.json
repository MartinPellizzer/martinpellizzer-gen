    "intro": "Tormentilla recta var. alpina, commonly known as alpine tormentil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a dense mat of small, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
