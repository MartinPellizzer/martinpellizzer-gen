    "intro": "Trichosporum nervosum, commonly known as the hairy false lichen, is a lichen-forming fungus that belongs to the family Trapeliaceae. It is characterized by its dense, branched thallus covered with short, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae or cyanobacteria, which contribute to its photosynthetic capabilities. It typically grows on tree bark, rocks, or soil in moist, shaded environments. Trichosporum nervosum is often found in temperate regions and is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants."
