    "intro": "Trisetaria hispida, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and wiry, leaf-like structures that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the grass family. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control. Trisetaria hispida thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds."
