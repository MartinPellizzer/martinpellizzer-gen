    "intro": "Tillandsia regnellii, commonly known as the silver vellum tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, fibrous covering that gives it a silvery appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its rosette-shaped structure helps collect and retain water, adapting it to arid environments. It produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette."
