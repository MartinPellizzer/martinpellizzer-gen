    "intro": "Tacca pinnatifida subsp. involucrata, commonly known as the \"snake plant\" or \"mother-in-law's tongue,\" is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stiff, upright leaves that are typically green with white or silver markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by a fleshy, spathe-like structure. It thrives in low-light conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying properties and low maintenance requirements."
