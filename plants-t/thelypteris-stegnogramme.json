    "intro": "Thelypteris stegnogramme, commonly known as the silver fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its elegant, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are bioluminescent in some species, though this trait may vary. The reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation."
