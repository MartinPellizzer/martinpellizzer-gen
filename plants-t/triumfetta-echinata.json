    "intro": "Triumfetta echinata, commonly known as the spiny triumfetta, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening or for erosion control."
