    "intro": "Tephrosia macbrideana, commonly known as the Macbride's tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume-like pods and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets. Tephrosia macbrideana is often found in dry savannas and woodland areas, where it contributes to soil fertility through its nitrogen-fixing properties."
