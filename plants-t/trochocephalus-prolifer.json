    "intro": "Trochocephalus prolifer, commonly known as the creeping coralroot, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph. It relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pale green flowers. It is typically found in shaded, moist forest habitats across eastern North America. Due to its reliance on fungi, its distribution is often limited by the presence of its host species."
