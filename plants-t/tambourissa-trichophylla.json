    "intro": "Tambourissa trichophylla, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in racemes. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
