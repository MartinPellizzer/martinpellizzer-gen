    "intro": "Thuja acuta, commonly known as the Japanese thuja, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and needle-like leaves that are typically a dark green color. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Thuja acuta is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
