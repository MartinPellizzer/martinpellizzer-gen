    "intro": "Tribonanthes elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant produces bright yellow berries that are edible but contain toxic compounds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both horticulture and ecological research."
