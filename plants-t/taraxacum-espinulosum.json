    "intro": "Taraxacum espinulosum, commonly known as the spiny dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spiny, lance-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a hollow, umbrella-like stem that supports the flower and later the seed parachute. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, often found in dry, rocky soils. Taraxacum espinulosum is a perennial herb that thrives in sunny, well-drained environments."
