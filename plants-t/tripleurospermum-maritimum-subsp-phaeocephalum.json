    "intro": "Tripleurospermum maritimum subsp. phaeocephalum, commonly known as the dark-headed seaside dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salt-laden environments. It has a low-growing habit and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. This subspecies is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands, contributing to stabilizing sandy soils."
