    "intro": "Thuja decurrens, commonly known as the creeping thuja, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern North America. It features dense, scale-like foliage that forms a low, mat-like growth habit, often reaching heights of only a few inches. The plant has a distinct aromatic scent and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves that are arranged in a tight, compact pattern. It is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and adaptability. Thuja decurrens is also valued for its ability to tolerate shade and poor soil conditions."
