    "intro": "Tephrocactus catacanthus, commonly known as the Mexican torch cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its ribbed, spiny stems and a distinctive red or orange coloration during the flowering season. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom at the ends of its stems, typically in the spring. Tephrocactus catacanthus is well adapted to hot, dry environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
