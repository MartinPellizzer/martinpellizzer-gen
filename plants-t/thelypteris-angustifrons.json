    "intro": "Thelypteris angustifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a bipinnate pattern. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris angustifrons thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
