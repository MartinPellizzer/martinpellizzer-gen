    "intro": "Thaspium macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited thaspium, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its fruit is a small, dry schizocarp that splits into two one-seeded parts when mature. Thaspium macrocarpum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
