    "intro": "Tephrocactus retrospinosus, commonly known as the backward-spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a tall, cylindrical stem that often branches at the base. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green, spiny structure. Its spines are arranged in a unique backward-facing pattern, providing both protection and a distinguishing characteristic. Tephrocactus retrospinosus is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
