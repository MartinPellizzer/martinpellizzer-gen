It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, downy texture. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Thalictrum rugosum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
