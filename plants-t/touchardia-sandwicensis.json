    "intro": "Touchardia sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandwicensis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within the tropical rainforests of Hawaii. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape with a smooth margin. Its flowers are small, clustered, and typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species."
