    "intro": "Tillandsia roseiflora, commonly known as the rose-flowered air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. Its striking pink or red flowers bloom from the center of the rosette, making it a visually appealing ornamental plant. Tillandsia roseiflora requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive."
