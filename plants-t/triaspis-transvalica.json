    "intro": "Triaspis transvalica, commonly known as the Transvaal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Triaspis transvalica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive blooms."
