    "intro": "Trilisa, commonly known as the yellow star moss, is a unique plant belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is a small, creeping moss that forms dense, cushion-like mats on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and pointed, with a yellowish-green color that becomes more vibrant in the spring. Trilisa is characterized by its intricate branching pattern and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. Due to its delicate structure, it is often used in horticultural displays to add a natural, textured element to gardens."
