    "intro": "Thelypteris semimetralis, commonly known as the narrow-veined shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into small, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
