    "intro": "Teucrium glaucum, commonly known as blue germander, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, silver-gray hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purplish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped, aromatic, and often have a slightly fuzzy texture. Teucrium glaucum is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
