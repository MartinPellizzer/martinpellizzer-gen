    "intro": "Triticum orientale subvar. macrostachyum, commonly known as the large-stalked wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to several feet in height. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Botanically, it is valued for its hardiness and potential use in forage or as a cover crop."
