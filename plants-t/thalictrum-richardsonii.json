    "intro": "Thalictrum richardsonii, commonly known as Richardson's meadow-rue, is a member of the Berberidaceae family and is native to North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring slender, often hairy stems. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early to mid-summer, which are borne on long, branching peduncles. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided leaflets that give the plant a delicate, fern-like appearance. Thalictrum richardsonii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
