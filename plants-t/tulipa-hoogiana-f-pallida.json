    "intro": "Tulipa hoogiana f. pallida, commonly known as the pale tulip, is a unique botanical variant characterized by its pale, often white or cream-colored petals. This form is a fasciation mutation of the standard *Tulipa hoogiana*, resulting in a flattened, ribbon-like flower structure. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It blooms in early spring, producing showy, elongated flowers that are highly valued in horticulture for their unusual appearance. The pale tulip is relatively easy to cultivate, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking distinctive floral displays."
