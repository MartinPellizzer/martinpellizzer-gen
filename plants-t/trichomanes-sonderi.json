    "intro": "Trichomanes sonderi, commonly known as the African maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds. Trichomanes sonderi is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
