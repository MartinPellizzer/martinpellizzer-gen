    "intro": "Tillandsia reducta, commonly known as the dwarf air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. This species is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia reducta is popular as a low-maintenance indoor plant due to its ability to thrive with minimal care and indirect light."
