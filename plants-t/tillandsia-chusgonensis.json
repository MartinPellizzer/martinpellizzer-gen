    "intro": "Tillandsia chusgonensis, commonly known as the Chusgon air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, fibrous roots that help it anchor to its host and absorb moisture from the air. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a thick layer of trichomes, which aid in water retention. This unique adaptation allows it to thrive in humid, shaded environments where other plants might struggle."
