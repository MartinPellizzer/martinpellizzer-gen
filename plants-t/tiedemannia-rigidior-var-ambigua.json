    "intro": "Tiedemannia rigidior var. ambigua, commonly known as the slender false Solomon's seal, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its fruit is a three-chambered capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and growth habits compared to the typical form of Tiedemannia rigidior."
