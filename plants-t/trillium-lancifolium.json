    "intro": "Trillium lancifolium, commonly known as the western trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features three large, showy, white to pale pink petals that are often veined with red or purple, and three broad, waxy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows from a rhizomatous root system and blooms in early spring before its foliage emerges. It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments and is often found in coniferous or mixed hardwood forests. Trillium lancifolium is an important component of the understory flora and is valued for its ecological and ornamental significance."
