    "intro": "Tournefortia foetida, commonly known as the stinkwood or stinkbush, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with narrow, leathery leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and arid conditions. The plant's name derives from its strong, unpleasant odor, which is particularly noticeable when the leaves are crushed."
