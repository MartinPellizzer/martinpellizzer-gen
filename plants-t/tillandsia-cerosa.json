    "intro": "Tillandsia cerosa, commonly known as the silver torch or silver tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
