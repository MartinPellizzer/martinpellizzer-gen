    "intro": "Taraxacum insularum, commonly known as the island dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the Canary Islands and is characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy white pappus, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of its island habitat. Taraxacum insularum is often found in open areas with poor soil, contributing to the ecological diversity of the Canary Islands."
