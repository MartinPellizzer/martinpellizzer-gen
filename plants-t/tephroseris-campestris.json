    "intro": "Tephroseris campestris, commonly known as the field dandelion, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a distinctive pappus-equipped seed sphere. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in agricultural settings. The leaves and flowers are edible, though the plant is generally considered more of a nuisance than a cultivated crop."
