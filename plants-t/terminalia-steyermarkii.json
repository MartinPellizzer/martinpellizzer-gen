It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of white flowers that appear at the ends of branches, giving it its common name. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture. The tree produces small, woody fruits that contain a single seed, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. It is valued for its ornamental flowers and has some traditional medicinal uses in local communities."
