    "intro": "Tribolium purpureum, commonly known as the purple grain beetle, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Curculionidae. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped body and a distinctive purple coloration on its exoskeleton. This beetle is primarily found in temperate regions and is often associated with stored grains and seeds. The larvae of Tribolium purpureum feed on various plant materials, contributing to its role in agricultural ecosystems. Due to its ability to infest stored food products, it is considered a pest in grain storage facilities."
