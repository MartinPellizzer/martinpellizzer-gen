    "intro": "Tribolium echinatum, commonly known as the spiny burr grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, spiny seed heads that form a protective structure for its seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Tribolium echinatum is well adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in such habitats."
