    "intro": "Trisetum lineare, commonly known as the slender feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, linear leaves and delicate, feathery panicles that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Trisetum lineare is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
