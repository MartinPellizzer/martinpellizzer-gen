    "intro": "Triumfettoides, commonly known as the \"false orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that resemble those of true orchids, often with intricate patterns and vibrant colors. The plants typically grow in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, where they thrive in partial to full shade. Their rhizomatous growth habit allows them to spread slowly and form dense mats over time. Triumfettoides species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in botanical gardens and as houseplants."
