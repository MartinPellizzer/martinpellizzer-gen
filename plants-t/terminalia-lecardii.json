    "intro": "Terminalia lecardii, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Terminalia lecardii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, woodland areas. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native habitat."
