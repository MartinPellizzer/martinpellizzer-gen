    "intro": "Trollius riederianus subsp. riederianus, commonly known as the Rieder's globeflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow, globe-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features a short, stout stem with broad, palmate leaves that are deeply lobed. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
