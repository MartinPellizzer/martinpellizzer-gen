    "intro": "Tephrosia humifusa, commonly known as the creeping tephrosia, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is known for its rapid growth habit. Tephrosia humifusa is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
