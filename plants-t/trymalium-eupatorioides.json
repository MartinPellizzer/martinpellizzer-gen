    "intro": "Trymalium eupatorioides, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and is often found in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a hairy texture. Trymalium eupatorioides is well adapted to saline and wind-prone environments, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
