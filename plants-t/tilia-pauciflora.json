    "intro": "Tilia pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered lime, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often developing shallow fissures with age. Tilia pauciflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
