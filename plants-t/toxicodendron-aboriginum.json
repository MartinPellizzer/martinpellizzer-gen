    "intro": "Toxicodendron aboriginum, commonly known as the indigenous poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to parts of Australia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically arranged in a zigzag pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It contains urushiol, a potent allergen that causes severe skin irritation upon contact. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in both natural and cultivated environments."
