    "intro": "Teucrium officinale, commonly known as germander, is a perennial herb native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Germander is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its aromatic leaves and flowering stems have been historically used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
