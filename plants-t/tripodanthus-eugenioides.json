    "intro": "Tripodanthus eugenioides, commonly known as the dwarf eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by dark red, edible berries. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens."
