The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in inflorescences at the tips of the branches. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface, varying in shape depending on the growth conditions. Tetrapora floribunda is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks."
