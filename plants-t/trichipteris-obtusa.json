    "intro": "Trichipteris obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere, including parts of South America and Australia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round foliage and contributing to the plant's ecological role in nutrient cycling."
