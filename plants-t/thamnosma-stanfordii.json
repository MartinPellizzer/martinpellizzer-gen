It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is found in specific habitats such as chaparral and coastal scrub. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
