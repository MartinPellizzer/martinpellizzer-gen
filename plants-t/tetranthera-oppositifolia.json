    "intro": "Tetranthera oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaf tetranthera, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its opposite leaf arrangement and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its flowers are clustered in dense heads. Tetranthera oppositifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
