    "intro": "Trifolium diversifolium, commonly known as the variable clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is native to North America and is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, which can include three leaflets with different shapes and sizes. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. Trifolium diversifolium is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides, contributing to soil nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
