    "intro": "Taraxacum primigeniforme, commonly known as the ancient dandelion, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust taproot system. The plant features bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which produce seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette and are covered with fine hairs. Taraxacum primigeniforme is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is often found in meadows, fields, and disturbed areas."
