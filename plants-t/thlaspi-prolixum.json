    "intro": "Thlaspi prolixum, commonly known as the long-stemmed cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Thlaspi prolixum is often found in moist, calcareous habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It is valued for its ornamental potential and its role in supporting pollinators."
