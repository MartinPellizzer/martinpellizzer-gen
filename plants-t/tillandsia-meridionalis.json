    "intro": "Tillandsia meridionalis, commonly known as the Southern Air Plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has dense, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and it blooms once in its lifetime. Tillandsia meridionalis is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
