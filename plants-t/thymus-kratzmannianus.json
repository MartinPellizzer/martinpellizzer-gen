    "intro": "Thymus kratzmannianus, commonly known as the Turkish thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, creeping stems covered in small, gray-green leaves that are aromatic and fuzzy to the touch. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or borders. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental flowers make it both a useful culinary herb and a valuable ornamental plant."
