    "intro": "Triticum repens var. caesium, commonly known as silvergrass, is a variant of the annual grass species that belongs to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and slender, arching stems that often form dense clumps. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of small, spikelet-like clusters that produce wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens or used in ecological restoration projects."
