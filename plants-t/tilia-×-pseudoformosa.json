    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 pseudoformosa, commonly known as the hybrid linden, is a deciduous tree belonging to the Tiliaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Tilia cordata (small-leaf linden) and Tilia platyphylla (Manchurian linden), resulting in a plant with characteristics of both parents. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring heart-shaped leaves that are often slightly lobed. Its flowers are fragrant, yellowish-green, and appear in drooping clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
