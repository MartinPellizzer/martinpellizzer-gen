    "intro": "Tillandsia ekmanii, commonly known as the Ekman's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a dense layer of trichomes that help absorb moisture from the air. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Due to its unique ability to thrive in humid, high-altitude environments, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
