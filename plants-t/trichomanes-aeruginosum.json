    "intro": "Trichomanes aeruginosum, commonly known as the copper moss, is a rare and delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, closely packed, and often metallic-green leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as rock crevices or on tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are usually short and upright, with a distinctive, intricate venation pattern. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
