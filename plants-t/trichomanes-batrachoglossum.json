    "intro": "Trichomanes batrachoglossum, commonly known as the frog's tongue fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, hair-like structures. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes batrachoglossum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
