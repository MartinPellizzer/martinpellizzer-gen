    "intro": "Turbinicarpus viereckii subsp. major, commonly known as the giant desert cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual element to its environment. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. This subspecies is valued for its resilience and unique appearance in succulent collections."
