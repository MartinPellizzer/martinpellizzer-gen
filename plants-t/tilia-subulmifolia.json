    "intro": "Tilia subulmifolia, commonly known as the needle-leaf lime, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring before the leaves fully develop. Its bark is smooth and light gray, often developing shallow fissures with age. This species is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
