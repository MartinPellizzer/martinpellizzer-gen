    "intro": "Thymus bolivari, commonly known as Bolivian thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Andean regions of South America. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species in its native habitat."
