    "intro": "Taxus kingstonii, commonly known as the Kingston yew, is a rare and critically endangered conifer native to Jamaica. It is characterized by its slow growth, evergreen foliage, and distinctive red seed cones. The plant has a dense, gnarled trunk and produces small, scale-like leaves that are dark green and leathery. It is closely related to other yew species but is distinguished by its unique morphological features and limited geographic range. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
