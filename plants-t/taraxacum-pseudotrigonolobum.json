    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudotrigonolobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, grass-like leaves and a distinctive flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides. Its flowers develop into a pappus-equipped seed head, which is commonly referred to as a \"dandelion clock.\" This species is noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
