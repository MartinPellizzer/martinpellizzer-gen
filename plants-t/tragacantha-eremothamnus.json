    "intro": "Tragacantha eremothamnus, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating called bloom. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Tragacantha eremothamnus is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in supporting local pollinators."
