    "intro": "Thelocactus hexaedrophorus var. major, commonly known as the giant thorned cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of northern Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and clusters of spiny, cylindrical stems that grow upward. Its flowers, which appear in late spring, are typically yellow or orange and are borne at the tips of the stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
