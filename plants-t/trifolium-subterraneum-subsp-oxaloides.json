It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed sites. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is extensive, contributing to soil stabilization and nutrient cycling. The subspecies is notable for its unique chemical properties, including the presence of oxalic acid, which influences its ecological interactions and potential uses."
