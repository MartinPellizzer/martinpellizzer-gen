    "intro": "Taxillus wiensii, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the stems of woody hosts, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal regions. Its presence can weaken its host plant, making it an important ecological factor in its habitat."
