    "intro": "Taxus florinii, commonly known as the Chinese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to China. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and reddish-brown bark that develops fissures with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds. Taxus florinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in shaded environments. However, it is also noted for containing toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans if ingested."
