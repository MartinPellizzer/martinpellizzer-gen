    "intro": "Trachymarathrum siculum, commonly known as the Sicilian rock orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open, sunny habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, rhizomatous stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
