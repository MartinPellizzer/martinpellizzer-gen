It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a single, hollow, hairless stem that supports a bright yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to southern Europe and is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. It produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous pappus-equipped seeds that are easily dispersed by wind. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
