It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round berries. Talisia allenii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade. It prefers well-drained soil and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
