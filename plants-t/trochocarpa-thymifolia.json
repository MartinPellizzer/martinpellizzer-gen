It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops and ornamental plants. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, often in shades of white or pale yellow. Its leaves are narrow and aromatic, resembling those of thyme, which contributes to its common name. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine environments."
