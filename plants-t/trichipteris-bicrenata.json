    "intro": "Trichipteris bicrenata, commonly known as the two-crested fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or partially emergent. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichipteris bicrenata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
