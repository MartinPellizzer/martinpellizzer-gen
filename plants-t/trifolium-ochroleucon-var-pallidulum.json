    "intro": "Trifolium ochroleucon var. pallidulum, commonly known as the pale yellow clover, is a variant of the yellow clover species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
