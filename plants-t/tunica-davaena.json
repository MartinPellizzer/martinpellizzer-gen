    "intro": "Tunica davaena, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, elongated, red or orange fruits that contain several seeds. Tunica davaena is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used historically in construction and tool-making. Its botanical features make it an important species in arid and semi-arid ecosystems."
