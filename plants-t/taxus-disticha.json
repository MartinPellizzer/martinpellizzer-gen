    "intro": "Taxus disticha, commonly known as the Japanese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It features dense, scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath, arranged in flat, fan-like clusters. The plant produces small, reddish berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in ornamental gardening. Taxus disticha is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional Chinese medicine."
