    "intro": "Thelypteris delicatula, commonly known as the delicate shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a small to medium-sized fern with delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a silvery or pale underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in various humid habitats. The fronds are usually evergreen, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, shield-like shape that gives the plant its common name."
