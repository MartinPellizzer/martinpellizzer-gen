    "intro": "Taxus cuspidata subsp. umbraculifera, commonly known as the Japanese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, reddish-brown seeds enclosed in a fleshy, orange aril. The plant has scale-like leaves arranged in flat sprays, and it produces yellowish-green cones that mature over several years. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Due to its toxicity, it requires careful handling and is not suitable for areas with small children or pets."
