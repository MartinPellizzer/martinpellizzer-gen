    "intro": "Turnera coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf turnera, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its woody stems are covered in small, stiff hairs, giving it a rugged appearance. Turnera coriacea is often found in dry forests and scrublands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
