    "intro": "Trapa longicarpa subsp. perlongicornis, commonly known as the long-horned water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruits that float on the water surface. The plant has broad, floating leaves that help it photosynthesize efficiently in aquatic environments. Its roots anchor it in muddy substrates, while its stems and leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. This subspecies is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats."
