    "intro": "Thuranthos basuticum, commonly known as the Basutu thornveld grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky, and semi-arid environments, often found in grasslands and shrublands. The plant has wiry, upright stems with sharp, spiny leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or pale yellow, and it produces small, oval seeds. Thuranthos basuticum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
