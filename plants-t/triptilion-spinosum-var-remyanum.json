    "intro": "Triptilion spinosum var. remyanum, commonly known as the spiny triptilion, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in temperate regions, often in shaded or partially shaded environments. Its unique spiny structures on the stems and leaves are adaptations to deter herbivores and reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
