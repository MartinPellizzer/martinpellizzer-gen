    "intro": "Tetrapetalum borneense, commonly known as the Bornean tetrapetalum, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems, typical of many tropical shrubs. Its leaves are usually simple and alternate, with a glossy surface that helps in photosynthesis under dense canopy conditions. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses seeds through wind or animal activity, contributing to its ecological role in the rainforest ecosystem."
