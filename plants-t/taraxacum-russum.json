    "intro": "Taraxacum russum, commonly known as the Russian dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that matures into a crown of white, parachute-like seeds. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in various environmental conditions. Taraxacum russum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
