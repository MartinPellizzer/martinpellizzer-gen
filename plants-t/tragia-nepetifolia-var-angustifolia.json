    "intro": "Tragia nepetifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf false nettle, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, alternate leaves that are typically lanceolate or ovate in shape, with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often borne in the axils of the leaves. Its roots are fibrous and can spread to form a dense mat, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
