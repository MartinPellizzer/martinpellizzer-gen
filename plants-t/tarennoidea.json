    "intro": "Tarennoidea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with prominent red stamens, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Tarennoidea is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain regions."
