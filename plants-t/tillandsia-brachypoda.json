    "intro": "Tillandsia brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage forms a rosette that traps moisture, allowing it to absorb water and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, showy inflorescences with white or pink flowers. It is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal care when cultivated."
