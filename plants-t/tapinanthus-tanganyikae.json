    "intro": "Tapinanthus tanganyikae, commonly known as the Tanganyika dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the forests of Tanzania. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the stems of other vegetation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving both parasitic and free-living stages. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Due to its specialized biology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically unique species."
