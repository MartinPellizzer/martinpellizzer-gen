    "intro": "Trichomanes bifolium, commonly known as the two-leaved maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes bifolium is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
