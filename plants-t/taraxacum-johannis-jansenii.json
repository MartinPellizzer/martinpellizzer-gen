    "intro": "Taraxacum johannis-jansenii, commonly known as the Jansen's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in temperate regions, characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a hollow, leafless stem. The plant produces a single, yellow flowering head that develops into a white, fluffy seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. The species is noted for its small size and is relatively uncommon in the wild."
