    "intro": "Taraxacum declive, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, bright yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, wind-dispersed seed stalk known as a pappus, which allows for efficient seed distribution. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Taraxacum declive is adapted to cold climates and is relatively frost-resistant, making it a hardy member of the dandelion family."
