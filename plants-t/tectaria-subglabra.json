    "intro": "Tectaria subglabra, commonly known as the smooth tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and covered with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature in ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Tectaria subglabra is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
