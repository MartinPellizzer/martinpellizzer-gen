    "intro": "Toxicodendron lucidum, commonly known as the glossy buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, glossy green leaves that turn red or orange in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
