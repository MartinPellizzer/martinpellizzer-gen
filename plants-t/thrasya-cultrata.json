    "intro": "Thrasya cultrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 2 inches wide, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Thrasya cultrata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
