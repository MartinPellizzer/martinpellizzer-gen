    "intro": "Trichomanes crispum var. fastigiata, commonly known as the upright holly fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, upright fronds that are usually dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The varietal form, fastigiata, is distinguished by its more compact and upright growth habit compared to the typical form."
