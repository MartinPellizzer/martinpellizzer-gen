    "intro": "Thelypodium, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and small, dandelion-like yellow flowers that develop into fluffy seed heads. Thelypodium species typically grow in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. They are often mistaken for true dandelions due to their similar appearance, but they differ in their leaf structure and flowering habits."
