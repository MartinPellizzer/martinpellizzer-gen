    "intro": "Tilia eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-brown bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. The woolly maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
