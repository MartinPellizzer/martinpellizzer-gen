    "intro": "Tonningia angusta, commonly known as the narrowleaf tonningia, is a climbing epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in protected areas within the Amazon rainforest."
