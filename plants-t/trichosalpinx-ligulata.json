    "intro": "Trichosalpinx ligulata, commonly known as the narrowleaf stiltroot, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant features slender, upright stems with palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy, pink to purple flowers bloom in late spring and are borne on pedicels that give it a stilt-like appearance. Trichosalpinx ligulata is typically found in moist, sandy soils in open woodlands and along streambanks."
