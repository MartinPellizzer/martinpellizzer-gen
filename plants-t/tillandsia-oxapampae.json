    "intro": "Tillandsia oxapampae, commonly known as the Oxapampa air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, silver-green leaves that are adapted to capture moisture from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers, which attract pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
