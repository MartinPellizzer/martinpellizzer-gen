    "intro": "Triticum aeternum var. album, commonly known as the Eternal White Wheat, is a rare and enigmatic botanical variant characterized by its striking white grain and prolonged flowering period. This wheat species exhibits unique genetic traits that contribute to its extended growth cycle, often lasting several seasons. Its leaves are broad and slightly serrated, with a silvery-green hue that distinguishes it from common wheat varieties. The plant is adapted to thrive in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils, typically found in temperate climates. Due to its rarity and distinctive features, it is of significant interest to botanists and agricultural researchers."
