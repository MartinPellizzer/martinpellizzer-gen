    "intro": "Trapa europaaea, commonly known as the European water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its distinctive feature is the spiny, floating fruit that contains the seeds, which can remain buoyant for extended periods. Trapa europaaea plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
