    "intro": "Tragia depauperata, commonly known as the poor man's tragia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water. The seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to colonize new areas efficiently."
