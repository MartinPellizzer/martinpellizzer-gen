    "intro": "Tragacantha sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemous inflorescences, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
