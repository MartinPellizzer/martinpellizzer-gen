    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. ramifera, commonly known as ramifera wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its unique branching structure. This variety exhibits a more complex inflorescence compared to standard wheat, with increased ramification in the spikelets. The plant typically grows to a height of 1.2 to 1.8 meters, featuring a robust root system that enhances its adaptability to various soil conditions. Its grain is generally smaller and more compact, which can affect milling and baking properties. Due to its distinct morphology, it is of interest in both agricultural research and botanical studies."
