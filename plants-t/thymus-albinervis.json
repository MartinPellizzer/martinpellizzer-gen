    "intro": "Thymus albinervis, commonly known as the white-veined thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features compact, creeping stems that produce small, aromatic leaves with a distinctive white or pale green vein pattern. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is often cultivated for both horticultural and herbal purposes."
