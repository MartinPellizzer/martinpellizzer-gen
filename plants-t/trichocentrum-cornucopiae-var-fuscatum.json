    "intro": "Trichocentrum cornucopiae var. fuscatum, commonly known as the dark-furred orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and produces showy, pendulous flowers with a distinctive orange and yellow coloration. The plant thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a challenging but rewarding species for experienced growers. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a prized specimen in botanical collections. The varietal name \"fuscatum\" refers to its darker, more muted leaf color compared to the typical form of Trichocentrum cornucopiae."
