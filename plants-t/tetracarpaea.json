    "intro": "Tetracarpaea, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. Its flowers are typically clustered in terminal spikes, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Tetracarpaea is well adapted to survive in harsh, low-nutrient soils and can thrive with minimal water."
