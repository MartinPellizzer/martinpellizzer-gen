    "intro": "Terebinthus nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's terebinth, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is a small, deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically eaten by local wildlife. Its botanical features include compound leaves and a preference for well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
