    "intro": "Trisetum tarnowskii, commonly known as the Tarnowskii false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Trisetum tarnowskii plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small mammals."
