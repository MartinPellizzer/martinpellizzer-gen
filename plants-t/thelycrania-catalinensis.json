    "intro": "Thelycrania catalinensis, commonly known as the Catalina thelycrania, is a flowering plant native to the island of Catalina in the Channel Islands off the coast of California. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal scrub habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
