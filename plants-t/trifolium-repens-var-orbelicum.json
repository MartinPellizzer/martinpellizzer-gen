    "intro": "Trifolium repens var. orbelicum, commonly known as the white clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. This variety is adapted to a wide range of soil types but prefers well-drained, fertile ground. It is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas due to its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen. The plant is also valued for its role in agriculture as a forage crop and for its ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
