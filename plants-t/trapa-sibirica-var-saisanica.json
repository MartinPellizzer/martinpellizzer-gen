It is characterized by its distinctive, floating, spiny nuts that develop underwater. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are broad and floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to various regions for aquatic garden use."
