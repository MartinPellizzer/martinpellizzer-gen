    "intro": "Tillandsia capillaris f. virescens, commonly known as the green-stemmed air plant, is a hybrid form of the genus Tillandsia, which belongs to the Bromeliaceae family. This epiphytic plant is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is native to regions of Central and South America. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. The varietal form 'virescens' is distinguished by its vivid green stems and leaves, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. Due to its air-purifying qualities and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
