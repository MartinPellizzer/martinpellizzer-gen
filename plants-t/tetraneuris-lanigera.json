    "intro": "Tetraneuris lanigera, commonly known as the wooly tetraneuris, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fuzzy, silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
