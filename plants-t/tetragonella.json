    "intro": "Tetragonella, commonly known as the four-cornered grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive four-sided stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The genus includes several species, many of which are native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. Tetragonella plants typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to dry conditions with their deep root systems. They are often found in grasslands and open woodlands, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
