    "intro": "Turnera asymmetrica, commonly known as the asymmetric turnera, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Turneraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, asymmetrical leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Turnera asymmetrica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
