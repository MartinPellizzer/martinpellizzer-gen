    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 pseudopulchra, commonly known as the hybrid linden or European linden, is a deciduous tree native to Europe. It is a hybrid between Tilia cordata and Tilia europaea, resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parent species. The tree has heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and dark green on top, with a lighter underside. It produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. The bark is smooth and light grey, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and tolerance to urban conditions."
