    "intro": "Teucrium pumilum subsp. turredanum, commonly known as the dwarf germander, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically features slender, creeping stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, tubular flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
