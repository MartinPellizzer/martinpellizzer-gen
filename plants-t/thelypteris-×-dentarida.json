    "intro": "Thelypteris \u00d7 dentarida, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between *Thelypteris acutifolia* and *Thelypteris hydrophila*. It is a shade-tolerant plant that thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in forest understories. The plant has finely divided, pinnately arranged fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. Its reproductive structures are reduced, and it does not produce spores, relying instead on vegetative propagation. Thelypteris \u00d7 dentarida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in shaded gardens."
