    "intro": "Tapinanthus erythraeus, commonly known as the red sandalwood or parasitic nightshade, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host plants for nutrients, often attaching itself to the roots of other species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, aromatic scent. It is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants."
