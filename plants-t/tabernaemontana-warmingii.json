It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, often growing in coastal areas. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice in horticulture, though its toxicity requires caution in cultivation."
