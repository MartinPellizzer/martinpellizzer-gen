    "intro": "Theobroma cacao f. lacandonense, commonly known as the Lacandon cocoa, is a botanical variant of the cacao tree native to the humid lowland forests of southern Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its small, elongated pods that contain bitter, high-cocoa-content beans. This form is often considered a wild relative of the cultivated cacao varieties, contributing to genetic diversity in breeding programs. Its leaves are typically larger and more leathery compared to those of the standard cacao tree. The plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained, nutrient-rich soils."
