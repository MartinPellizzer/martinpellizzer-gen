    "intro": "Trifolium scabrum var. glabrum, commonly known as hairy clover, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slight hairy texture. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
