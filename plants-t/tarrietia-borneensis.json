It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, pentamerous flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
