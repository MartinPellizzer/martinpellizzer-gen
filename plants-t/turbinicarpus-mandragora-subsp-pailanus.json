    "intro": "Turbinicarpus mandragora subsp. pailanus, commonly known as the Pailan\u2019s turbinated cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed, spiny structure that helps it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stem. This subspecies is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative succulent."
