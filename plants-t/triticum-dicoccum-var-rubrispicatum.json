    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum var. rubrispicatum, commonly known as red spiculated emmer wheat, is a wild wheat species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, robust stature and distinctive red, spiky awns that give it its common name. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typical of the wheat tribe. Its grains are relatively large and have a tough, inedible hull that must be removed before consumption. This variety is valued for its hardiness and historical significance in early agricultural practices."
