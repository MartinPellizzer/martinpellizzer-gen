    "intro": "Taverniera incana, commonly known as the silverleaf shrub, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for landscape design in arid regions."
