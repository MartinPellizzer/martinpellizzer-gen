    "intro": "Taraxacum jurassicum, commonly known as the Jurassic dandelion, is a rare and ancient species of flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a capsule containing numerous seeds with parachute-like pappus, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Due to its historical significance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
