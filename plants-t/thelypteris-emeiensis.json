    "intro": "Thelypteris emeiensis, commonly known as the Emei mountain shield fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help stabilize soil. The fronds are often covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance."
