    "intro": "Tragia pilosa, commonly known as the hairy tragia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has hairy leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dry savannas. Tragia pilosa is adapted to arid conditions and has a shallow root system for efficient water uptake."
