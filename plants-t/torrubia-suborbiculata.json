    "intro": "Torrubia suborbiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water-plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe. It features elongated, narrow leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in wetland habitats. Torrubia suborbiculata plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
