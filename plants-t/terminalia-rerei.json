    "intro": "Terminalia rerei, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The tree produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, yellowish fruits. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to shed leaves seasonally, creating a dramatic visual effect. Terminalia rerei is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
