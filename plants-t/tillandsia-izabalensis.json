    "intro": "Tillandsia izabalensis, commonly known as the Izabal air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can trap moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that bloom once in its lifetime. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
