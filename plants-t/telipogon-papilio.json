    "intro": "Telipogon papilio, commonly known as the papilio orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with intricate patterns that resemble butterflies, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, thriving in cool and moist conditions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects attracted by their vivid colors and scent. Telipogon papilio is a rare and delicate species, often found in specialized habitats that make it vulnerable to environmental changes."
