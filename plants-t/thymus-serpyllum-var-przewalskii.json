    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. przewalskii, commonly known as Przewalski's thyme, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and small, aromatic leaves that emit a strong thyme scent. The plant produces small pink to purple flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. This variety is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb due to its essential oils and aromatic properties."
