    "intro": "Thesium heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable thesium, is a flowering plant species native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant typically produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white in color. Its leaves are alternate and elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its often dry habitat. Thesium heterophyllum is adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky areas."
