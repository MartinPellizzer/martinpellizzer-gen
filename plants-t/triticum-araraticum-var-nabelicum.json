    "intro": "Triticum araraticum var. nabelicum, commonly known as the Armenian wheat, is a variant of the wild wheat species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hardy nature, thriving in temperate climates. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with pale blue to green flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its grains are generally smaller and less productive compared to cultivated wheat varieties. Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest for agricultural research and breeding programs."
