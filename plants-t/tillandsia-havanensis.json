    "intro": "Tillandsia havanensis, commonly known as the Havana air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Cuba. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, adapted to its arid environment. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
