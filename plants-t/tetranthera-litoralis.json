    "intro": "Tetranthera litoralis, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a shrub that typically grows near the shoreline, adapted to salty and windy conditions. The plant features showy, five-petaled flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Tetranthera litoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
