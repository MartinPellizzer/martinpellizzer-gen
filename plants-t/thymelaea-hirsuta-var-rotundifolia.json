    "intro": "Thymelaea hirsuta var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leafed thymelaea, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, dark green, rounded leaves that are densely covered in short, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. This variant is distinguished by its rounded leaves, which set it apart from the typical form of Thymelaea hirsuta."
