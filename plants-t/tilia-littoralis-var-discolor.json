    "intro": "Tilia littoralis var. discolor, commonly known as the white-barked maple, is a deciduous tree native to the coastal regions of Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that becomes fissured with age, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils near rivers and coastlines."
