    "intro": "Thinopyrum junceiforme, commonly known as the jointed wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and distinctive jointed stems, which give it its common name. This plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions. Thinopyrum junceiforme has a fibrous root system and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
