    "intro": "Tragacantha marshalliana, commonly known as Marshall's tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant produces a sticky, resinous substance called tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a food thickener. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in shrubland and woodland habitats. Due to its unique properties and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
