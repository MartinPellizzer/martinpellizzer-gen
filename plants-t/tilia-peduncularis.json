    "intro": "Tilia peduncularis, commonly known as the pedunculate or small-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of the common linden (Tilia europaea). The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in woodland areas."
