    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. piligerus, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, pink or white flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and other compounds, give it a strong, aromatic scent and make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications."
