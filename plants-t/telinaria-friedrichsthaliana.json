It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in Mexico and Guatemala. The plant is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is relatively rare in horticultural trade."
