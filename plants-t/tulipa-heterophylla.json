    "intro": "Tulipa heterophylla, commonly known as the variable tulip, is a species of flowering plant in the family Liliaceae. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in rocky and sunny habitats. The plant is characterized by its diverse leaf shapes, which can vary from grass-like to broad and sword-shaped, depending on environmental conditions. Its flowers are typically cup-shaped with bright yellow petals, often displaying a striking contrast with their dark centers. This variability in morphology makes it a unique and interesting subject for botanical study."
