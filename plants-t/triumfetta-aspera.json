    "intro": "Triumfetta aspera, commonly known as the rough triumfetta, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and wastelands. Triumfetta aspera is also known for its medicinal uses in traditional herbal medicine."
