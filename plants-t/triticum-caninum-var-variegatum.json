    "intro": "Triticum caninum var. variegatum, commonly known as the variegated goatgrass, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive variegated leaf patterns, which feature a mix of green and white or yellow markings. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, and it produces small, hard grains. Due to its genetic diversity, it has been studied for its potential role in wheat breeding programs."
