    "intro": "Thalictrum rotundum, commonly known as roundleaf meadow-rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are rounded at the base and have a soft, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Thalictrum rotundum is often found in woodland areas and along streambanks, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
