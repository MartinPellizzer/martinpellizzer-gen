    "intro": "Tetradenia lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly tetradenia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodland or scrub habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
