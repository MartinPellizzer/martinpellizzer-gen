    "intro": "Tylloma ciliatum, commonly known as the woolly ciliate, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. Tylloma ciliatum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
