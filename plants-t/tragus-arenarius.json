    "intro": "Tragus arenarius, commonly known as the sand tragus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Tragus arenarius is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
