    "intro": "Trigonella arcuata var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered fenugreek, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy areas and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its seeds are used in traditional medicine and are similar to those of the common fenugreek, though it is less widely cultivated. The species is noted for its ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
