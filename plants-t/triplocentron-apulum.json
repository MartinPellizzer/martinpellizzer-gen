    "intro": "Triplocentron apulum, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are often pink or purple and bloom in late spring to early summer."
