    "intro": "Tessmannia copallifera, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that release seeds when mature. Tessmannia copallifera thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or heathlands near the coast. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
