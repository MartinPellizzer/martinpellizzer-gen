This plant is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green, which bloom in late spring. The plant is known for its ability to form gemmae, which are tiny plantlets that can grow into new plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
