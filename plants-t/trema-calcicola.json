    "intro": "Trema calcicola, commonly known as the limestone trema, is a small, herbaceous plant native to calcareous soils in tropical regions. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Its fruits are dry, capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Trema calcicola is often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments."
