    "intro": "Taraxacum melleum, commonly known as the edible dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a flower head composed of yellow ray florets. The plant produces a distinctive seed head, known as a \"clock,\" which consists of tiny, wind-dispersed seeds with pappus structures. Taraxacum melleum is native to Europe but has been naturalized in many parts of the world, including North America. It is known for its edible leaves, which are commonly used in salads and for its purported medicinal properties."
