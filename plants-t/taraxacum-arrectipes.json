    "intro": "Taraxacum arrectipes, commonly known as the upright dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, which distinguishes it from the more commonly seen prostrate dandelions. The plant produces a single, prominent flower head that is surrounded by bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically lobed and arranged in a basal rosette, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Taraxacum arrectipes is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a common weed in many regions."
