    "intro": "Triticum atratum, commonly known as the black wheat, is a species of wild wheat native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black husk, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear small, two-lobed florets. Triticum atratum is a perennial plant that thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
