    "intro": "Triumfetta heliocarpa, commonly known as the sun fruit or yellow glorybower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are often followed by distinctive, inflated, three-lobed seed pods. Triumfetta heliocarpa is adapted to dry conditions and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its ornamental value comes from its bright flowers and unique seed pods, making it a popular choice for gardens in suitable climates."
