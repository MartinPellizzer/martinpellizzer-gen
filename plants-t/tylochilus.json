    "intro": "Tylochilus, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a prominently shaped labellum that resembles a horn or a spur. The plants are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they thrive in humid, tropical environments. Tylochilus species often have showy, colorful flowers that attract various pollinators. Their botanical significance lies in their intricate morphology and ecological role within their native habitats."
