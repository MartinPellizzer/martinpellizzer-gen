It features small, gray-green leaves that are aromatic and covered in fine hairs, typical of the thyme genus. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in dense clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and cliffs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
