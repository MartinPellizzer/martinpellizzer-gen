    "intro": "Thelymitra nuda, commonly known as the naked leek orchid, is an endemic Australian plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial herb with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single, slender flowering stem. The flowers are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It is found in southern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria, often in heathlands or open forests. Thelymitra nuda is a short-lived plant, with a lifespan of only a few years, and is considered rare due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
