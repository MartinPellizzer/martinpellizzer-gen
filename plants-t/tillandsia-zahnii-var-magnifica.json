    "intro": "Tillandsia zahnii var. magnifica, commonly known as the Magnificent Air Plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that bloom once in its lifetime. It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive."
