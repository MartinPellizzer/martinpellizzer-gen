    "intro": "Taraxacum medeense, commonly known as the Medean dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a spherical seed head with parachute-like seeds. Native to Central Europe, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has a taproot system and is often found in disturbed or marginal areas. It is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and fragmentation."
