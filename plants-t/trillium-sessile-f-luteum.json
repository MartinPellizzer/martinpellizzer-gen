    "intro": "Trillium sessile f. luteum, commonly known as the yellow trillium, is a rare and striking variant of the trillium genus. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers, which contrast with the typical white or green hues of other trillium species. The plant features three broad, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a whorl at the base. It thrives in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in the eastern United States. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
