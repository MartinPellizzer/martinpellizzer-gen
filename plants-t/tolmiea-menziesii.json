    "intro": "Tolmiea menziesii, commonly known as the silver mite or white mite, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with silvery-white to grayish-green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Tolmiea menziesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in shaded, humid environments."
