    "intro": "Thalictrum riparium, commonly known as water avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist environments in North America. It typically grows along stream banks and wet meadows, where it thrives in partially shaded to sunny conditions. The plant features slender stems with whorled leaves that are usually lance-shaped and have a soft, fuzzy texture. Its showy, greenish-white flowers appear in early spring and are clustered in loose cymes, attracting pollinators like bees and flies. Thalictrum riparium is valued in wetland restoration projects for its ecological benefits and aesthetic appeal."
