    "intro": "Tournefortiopsis ochreata, commonly known as the ochre lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its yellowish to ochre-colored thallus, which gives it its common name. The lichen forms a crustose growth on rocks and soil surfaces, typically in temperate and subarctic regions. It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. Tournefortiopsis ochreata is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
