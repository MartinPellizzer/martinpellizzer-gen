    "intro": "Terebinthus pistacia, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a species of flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia, where it thrives in dry, rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. Its hard, heavy wood has been historically valued for its durability and use in construction and tool-making. The tree also produces a resin that has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of turpentine."
