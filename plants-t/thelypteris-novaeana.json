    "intro": "Thelypteris novaeana, commonly known as the New Zealand sword fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in the soil. Thelypteris novaeana plays an important role in the ecological structure of its native habitat."
