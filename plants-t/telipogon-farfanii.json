    "intro": "Telipogon farfanii, commonly known as the Farfan's orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip that is characteristic of the Orchidaceae family. It has a short, fibrous root system and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Telipogon farfanii is critically important for conservation efforts in its native range."
