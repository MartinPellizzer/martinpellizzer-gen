    "intro": "Trichachne tenuis, commonly known as slender trichachne, is a grass species native to various regions of Africa and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial plant with narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
