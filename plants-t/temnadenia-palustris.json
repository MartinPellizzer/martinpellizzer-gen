    "intro": "Temnadenia palustris, commonly known as swamp mallow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It features oval to lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system helps stabilize soil in moist environments, making it ecologically significant in wetlands. Temnadenia palustris thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently damp to wet soil conditions."
