    "intro": "Tulipa sylvestris f. fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant woodland tulip, is a botanical variant of the woodland tulip, characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers. This perennial bulbous plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces vibrant, cup-shaped blooms in shades of yellow to orange. The most distinguishing feature of this form is its strong, sweet fragrance, which is more pronounced than in the typical species. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique aromatic qualities in gardens and botanical collections."
