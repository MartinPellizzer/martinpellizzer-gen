It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically bright green and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, lawns, and along roadsides. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated for landscaping purposes."
