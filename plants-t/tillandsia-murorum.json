    "intro": "Tillandsia murorum, commonly known as the rock tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant thrives in rocky and coastal environments, where it attaches itself to surfaces using its fibrous roots. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of white or green. Due to its unique adaptation to arid conditions, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
