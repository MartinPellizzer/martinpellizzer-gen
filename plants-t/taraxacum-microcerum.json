    "intro": "Taraxacum microcerum, commonly known as the small-horned dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a stem that bears a single flower head. The flowers are yellow and produce wind-dispersed seeds with parachute-like structures. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. This species is relatively small compared to other dandelions, with a compact growth form and distinctive, finely haired foliage."
