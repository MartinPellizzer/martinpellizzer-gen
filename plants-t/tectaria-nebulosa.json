    "intro": "Tectaria nebulosa, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often resemble a cloud, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its fronds. Tectaria nebulosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
