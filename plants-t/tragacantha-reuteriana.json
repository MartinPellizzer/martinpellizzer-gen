    "intro": "Tragacantha reuteriana, commonly known as the Persian tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by pod-like fruits containing small, hard seeds. Its roots are known for their ability to exude a gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive."
