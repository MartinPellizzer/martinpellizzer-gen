    "intro": "Trachypogon muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spike-like clusters, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Trachypogon muelleri is adapted to survive in harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem."
