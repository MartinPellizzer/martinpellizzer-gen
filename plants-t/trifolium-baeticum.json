    "intro": "Trifolium baeticum, commonly known as the Iberian clover, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Trifolium baeticum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
