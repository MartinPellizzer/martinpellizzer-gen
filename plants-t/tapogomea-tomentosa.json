It is characterized by its hairy, tomentose leaves that give it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
