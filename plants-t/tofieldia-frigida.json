It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Tofieldia frigida is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate snow cover during winter. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
