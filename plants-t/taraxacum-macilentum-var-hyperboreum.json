    "intro": "Taraxacum macilentum var. hyperboreum, commonly known as the Arctic dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in alpine and arctic tundra environments, where it thrives in low temperatures and well-drained soils. The plant features a rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and produces a single, tall, yellow flower head that blooms in late spring or early summer. Its fibrous root system is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This species is notable for its resilience to harsh climatic conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems."
