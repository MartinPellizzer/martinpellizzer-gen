    "intro": "Taxus globosa, commonly known as the Japanese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and reddish-brown bark that becomes scaly with age. The plant produces small, reddish berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Taxus globosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
