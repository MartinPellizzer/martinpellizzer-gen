    "intro": "Trifolium rusbyi subsp. multipedunculatum, commonly known as the multipedunculate clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval to lanceolate leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers in dense, clustered inflorescences, typically during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
