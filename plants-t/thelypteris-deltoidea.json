    "intro": "Thelypteris deltoidea, commonly known as the delta fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to the substrate, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris deltoidea plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
