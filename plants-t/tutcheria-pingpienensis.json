    "intro": "Tutcheria pingpienensis, commonly known as the Pingpien stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to China. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapted to arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, which bloom in the summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
