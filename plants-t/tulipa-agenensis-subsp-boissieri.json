    "intro": "Tulipa agenensis subsp. boissieri, commonly known as the Boissier's tulip, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and northern Iran. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange and yellow. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
