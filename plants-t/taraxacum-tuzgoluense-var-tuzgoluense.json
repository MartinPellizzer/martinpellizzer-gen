    "intro": "Taraxacum tuzgoluense var. tuzgoluense, commonly known as the Tuzgoluen dandelion, is a perennial herb native to Turkey. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that produces a single, yellow composite flower. The plant is adapted to grow in dry, rocky, and semi-arid environments. It has small, rough, and hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
