    "intro": "Turritis gerardiana, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound umbels of small white or pink flowers. The plant has a short, hairy stem and is often found growing in rocky soils or along dry streambeds. Its leaves are pinnately divided and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Turritis gerardiana is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
