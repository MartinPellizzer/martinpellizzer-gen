    "intro": "Trifolium sarosiense, commonly known as the Saros oil clover, is a flowering plant species native to the Carpathian Basin. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
