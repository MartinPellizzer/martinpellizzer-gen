    "intro": "Tephrosia oligophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or white, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported antifungal and insecticidal properties."
