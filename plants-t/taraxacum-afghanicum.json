    "intro": "Taraxacum afghanicum, commonly known as Afghan dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that rises from the center of the rosette, topped with a single, bright yellow composite flower head. Its flowers develop into spherical, prickly seed heads that are dispersed by the wind. This species is often found in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
