It is characterized by its hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to the Americas, this plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. It has a basal rosette growth habit and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
