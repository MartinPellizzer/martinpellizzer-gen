    "intro": "Tanacetum palmatifidum, commonly known as the broad-leaved tansy, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often aromatic and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that are typically clustered in flat-topped inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Tanacetum palmatifidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in herbal medicine."
