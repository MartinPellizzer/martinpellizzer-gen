    "intro": "Triumfetta rupestris, commonly known as the rock triumfetta, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in rocky or coastal areas. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Triumfetta rupestris is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
