    "intro": "Tillandsia usneoides var. filiformis, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is a bromeliad that thrives as an epiphyte, growing on trees in humid tropical climates. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces. The plant features long, thin, thread-like leaves that drape from branches, creating a dense, moss-like appearance. It is often found in the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. While it may resemble a parasitic plant, it does not harm its host and plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms."
