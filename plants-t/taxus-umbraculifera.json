It is characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over a two-year cycle. It prefers well-drained soils and partial to full shade, often found in mountainous regions. Taxus umbraculifera is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine."
