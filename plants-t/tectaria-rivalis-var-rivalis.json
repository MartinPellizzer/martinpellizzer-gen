    "intro": "Tectaria rivalis var. rivalis, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a terrestrial fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are covered in fine, hairy structures that aid in moisture retention. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in specialized structures called sori."
