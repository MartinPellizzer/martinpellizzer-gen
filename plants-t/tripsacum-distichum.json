    "intro": "Tripsacum distichum, commonly known as wild maize or tucanilla, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, two-ranked spikelets that are often tinged with purple or red. It is closely related to maize and has been used by indigenous peoples for food and fiber. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of grass evolution and domestication."
