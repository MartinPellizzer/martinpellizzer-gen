    "intro": "Tupistra urceolata, commonly known as the rock tulip, is a low-growing, evergreen plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, mat-forming foliage composed of small, glossy, dark green leaves that are often curled into tight rosettes. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
