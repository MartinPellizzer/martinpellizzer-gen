It is characterized by a white cap that turns yellowish with age, a bulbous base, and a distinct ring on the stem. The mushroom contains potent toxins, including amatores, which can cause severe liver failure in humans and animals. It is often mistaken for edible mushrooms, making it a significant hazard in foraging environments. Due to its toxicity, it is crucial to avoid consuming any part of this fungus."
