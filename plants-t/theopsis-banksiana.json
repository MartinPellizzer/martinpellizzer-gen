It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which resembles a dense, spherical cluster of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shrubland habitats and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces woody capsules that contain seeds. Theopsis banksiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
