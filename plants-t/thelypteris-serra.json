    "intro": "Thelypteris serra, commonly known as the serrate holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are finely serrated along the edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream sides. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. Thelypteris serra is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
