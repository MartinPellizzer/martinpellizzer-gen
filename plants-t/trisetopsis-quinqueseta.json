It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of tiny white or yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its unique morphology includes five leaves per stem, which is reflected in its scientific name.
