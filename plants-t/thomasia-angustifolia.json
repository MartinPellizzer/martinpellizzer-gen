It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and showy white to pink flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in coastal and sandy habitats, where it adapts well to sunny conditions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
