    "intro": "Taraxacum karwendelense, commonly known as the Karwendel dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family. It is native to the Alpine regions of Europe, particularly in the Karwendel mountain range in Austria and Germany. This plant is characterized by its hairy stems, spoon-shaped leaves, and yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seed heads. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges. The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
