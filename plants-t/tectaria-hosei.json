    "intro": "Tectaria hosei, commonly known as the broad-leafed tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often on rocky or wooded substrates. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense mats, contributing to its ability to colonize various habitats. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, which are covered in small, rounded structures called sorus."
