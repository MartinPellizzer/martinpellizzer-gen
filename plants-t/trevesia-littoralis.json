    "intro": "Trevesia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal trevesia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and usually have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in coastal environments. Trevesia littoralis is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it an important component of coastal vegetation."
