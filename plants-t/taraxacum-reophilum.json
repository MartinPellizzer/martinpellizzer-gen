    "intro": "Taraxacum reophilum, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, where it adapts to cold temperatures and low nutrient soils. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The species is notable for its ability to survive in harsh alpine conditions, making it an important component of mountain ecosystems."
