It thrives in humid, tropical environments, often growing on trees or rocks. The plant has long, narrow leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
