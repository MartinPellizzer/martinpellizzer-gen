    "intro": "Taraxacum canarense, commonly known as the Canary dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the Canary Islands and is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a distinctive seed-filled sphere, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Taraxacum canarense is adapted to the subtropical climate of the Canary Islands and exhibits features typical of the Taraxacum genus, including its medicinal properties and ability to colonize disturbed sites."
