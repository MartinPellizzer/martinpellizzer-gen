    "intro": "Tetrazygia fuertesii, commonly known as the Fuertes' cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of Socotra. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tetrazygia fuertesii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
