    "intro": "Taraxacum franconicum, commonly known as the Franconian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy white pappus, aiding in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries."
