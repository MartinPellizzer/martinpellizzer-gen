    "intro": "Trichosalpinx robledorum, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its vibrant purple and yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in cloud forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it has a unique structure with a tall, slender stem and clustered inflorescences. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
