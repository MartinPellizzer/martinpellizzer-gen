    "intro": "Thelypteris reducta, commonly known as the reduced shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that produce both roots and new shoots. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a dense, foliage-like appearance. Thelypteris reducta is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
