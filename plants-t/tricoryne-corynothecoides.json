    "intro": "Tricoryne corynothecoides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, narrow leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Tricoryne corynothecoides is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes."
