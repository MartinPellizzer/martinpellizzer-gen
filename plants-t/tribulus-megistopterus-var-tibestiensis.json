    "intro": "Tribulus megistopterus var. tibestiensis, commonly known as the Tibesti Tribulus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Tibesti Mountains in Chad. It is a member of the Zygophyllaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in harsh, semi-desert environments, adapting to extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are typically small and succulent, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations in a challenging environment."
