    "intro": "Taraxacum malyi, commonly known as the Malyi dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a white, fluffy pappus for seed dispersal. Native to Central Asia, this plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It is a perennial herb that exhibits a taproot system, allowing it to survive in adverse environmental conditions. The plant's morphology and reproductive strategy are adaptations to its arid native environment."
