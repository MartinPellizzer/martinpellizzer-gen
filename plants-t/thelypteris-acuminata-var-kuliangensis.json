    "intro": "Thelypteris acuminata var. kuliangensis, commonly known as the Kuliang fern, is a variant of the slender woodfern. It is a herbaceous plant belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae, characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. This variety is native to regions in East Asia, including China, and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
