    "intro": "Trias merguensis, commonly known as the Merguensian Trias, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the arid regions of North Africa. It belongs to the family Triacanthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, spiny leaves and small, pale flowers. The plant has adapted to extreme desert conditions through thick, water-storing stems and a deep root system. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and its role as an indicator of ancient ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
