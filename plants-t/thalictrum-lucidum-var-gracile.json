It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and often covered in a soft, silky texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, spurred flowers that bloom in early to mid-summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its graceful appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
