    "intro": "Thlaspi glaucophyllum, commonly known as the glaucous cabbageweed, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing, herbaceous plant characterized by its glaucous (waxy) leaves and small, yellow flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in grasslands and along roadsides. The plant produces small, rounded seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It is often considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting pollinators."
