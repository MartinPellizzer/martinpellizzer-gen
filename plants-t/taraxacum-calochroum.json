    "intro": "[WRONG START] Taraxacum calochroun, commonly known as the golden dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and distinctive, deeply lobed leaves. Native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. The plant produces a hollow, wind-dispersed seed head, a feature common among many dandelion species. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to both herbivory and seed dispersal strategies."
