    "intro": "Thelypteris marginalis f. davenportii, commonly known as the Davenport's marginal holly fern, is a fern species belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive marginal vein pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while facilitating nutrient absorption. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
