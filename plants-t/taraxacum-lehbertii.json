    "intro": "Taraxacum lehbertii, commonly known as the Lehbert's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a fluffy seed sphere. Native to the western United States, this plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions and is often found in areas with poor soil. The plant is considered a perennial and is adapted to full sun exposure."
