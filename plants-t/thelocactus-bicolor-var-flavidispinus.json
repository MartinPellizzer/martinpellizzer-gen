    "intro": "Thelocactus bicolor var. flavidispinus, commonly known as the yellow-spined thorned cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is a drought-tolerant plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as an ornamental cactus."
