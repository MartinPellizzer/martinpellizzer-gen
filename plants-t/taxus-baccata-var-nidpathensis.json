    "intro": "Taxus baccata var. nidpathensis, commonly known as the Nidpathensis yew, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the common yew. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, reddish-brown berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
