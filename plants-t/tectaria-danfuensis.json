    "intro": "Tectaria danfuensis, commonly known as the Danfu shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are usually located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Tectaria danfuensis is native to Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its natural habitat."
