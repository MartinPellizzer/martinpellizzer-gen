    "intro": "Tragacantha castellana, commonly known as Spanish tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a distinctive resinous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a thickening agent. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapting to arid environments. Tragacantha castellana thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats."
