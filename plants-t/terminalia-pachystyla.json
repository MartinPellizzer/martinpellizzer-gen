    "intro": "Terminalia pachystyla, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Its wood is highly valued for its fine grain and durability, making it important in local timber industries. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions."
