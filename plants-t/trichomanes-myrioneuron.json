    "intro": "Trichomanes myrioneuron, commonly known as the golden huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Trichomanes myrioneuron is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
