    "intro": "Thelypteris boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Bonin Islands. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize rocky or coastal areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Thelypteris boninensis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
