    "intro": "Thalictrum pratense, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces feathery, elongated seed pods that disperse its seeds by wind. Thalictrum pratense is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and ecological value to pollinators."
