    "intro": "Thesidium globosum, commonly known as the globe lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form and a pale to yellowish-green color. The thallus is typically composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on bark or soil surfaces. This lichen is known for its slow growth and is used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants."
