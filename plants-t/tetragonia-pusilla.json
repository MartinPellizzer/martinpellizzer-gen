    "intro": "Tetragonia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf spinach or seaside spinach, is a small, succulent plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by round, edible berries. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and drought conditions. Tetragonia pusilla is often used in traditional medicine and as a leafy green in local cuisines."
