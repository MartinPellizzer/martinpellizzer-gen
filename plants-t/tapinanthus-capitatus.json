    "intro": "Tapinanthus capitatus, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of other plants to obtain water and nutrients. It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has slender, creeping stems and produces small, yellowish-green leaves. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in local ecosystems by influencing host plant growth and providing food for certain insects."
