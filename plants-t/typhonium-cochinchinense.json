    "intro": "Typhonium cochinchinense, commonly known as the giant arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces a spadix inflorescence surrounded by a spathe, typical of many members of its family. Its rhizomes are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines for their starchy texture. However, the plant contains calcium oxalate crystals, which can cause irritation if ingested without proper preparation."
