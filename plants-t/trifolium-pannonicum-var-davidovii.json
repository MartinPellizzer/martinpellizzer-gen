    "intro": "Trifolium pannonicum var. davidovii, commonly known as the Pannonian clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense, spherical heads, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
