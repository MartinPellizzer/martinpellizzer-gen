    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. leucocladus, commonly known as the white wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its lighter grain color. This variety is typically found in temperate regions and is adapted to a range of soil conditions. The plant has a robust root system and produces spikelets that contain multiple florets. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. While less commonly cultivated than other wheat varieties, it is valued for its unique characteristics in both agricultural and ecological contexts."
