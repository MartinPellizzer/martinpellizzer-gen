    "intro": "Taraxacum unciferum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of basal, hairless, and often waxy leaves. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy white seed head, which is easily dispersed by the wind. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. The species is known for its medicinal uses and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
