    "intro": "Thelypteris hieronymusii, commonly known as the Hieronymus' shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, glossy fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Thelypteris hieronymusii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
