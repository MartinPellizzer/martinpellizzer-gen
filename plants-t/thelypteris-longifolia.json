    "intro": "Thelypteris longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Thelypteris longifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to add a lush, green texture to gardens."
