It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are covered in small, bristly spines. The plant produces small yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Due to its unique appearance and adaptations, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
