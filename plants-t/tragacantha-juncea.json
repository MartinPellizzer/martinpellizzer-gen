    "intro": "Tragacantha juncea, commonly known as the Persian gum or goat's rue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces a sticky resin known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent. Tragacantha juncea thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and woodland habitats. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various herbivores."
