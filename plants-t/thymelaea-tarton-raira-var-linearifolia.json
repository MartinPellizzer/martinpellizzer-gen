    "intro": "Thymelaea tarton-raira var. linearifolia, commonly known as the linear-leaved thymelaea, is a shrub native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, compact habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom in spring. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments."
