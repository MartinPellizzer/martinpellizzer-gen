    "intro": "Typha kalatensis, commonly known as the Kalatensian cattail, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, lakes, and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant features a tall, cylindrical stem that supports broad, flat leaves, and it produces a distinctive brown, cylindrical inflorescence at the top. Its flowering structure consists of two types of flowers: a lower, spadix-like structure and an upper, more compact one. Typha kalatensis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
