    "intro": "Taraxacum asperatilobum, commonly known as the rough-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of rough, lobed leaves and a yellow flowering head that develops into a distinctive seed-filled puffball. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a taproot system and is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. The species is similar to other dandelions but can be distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and growth habits."
