    "intro": "Thalictrum simplex subsp. amurense, commonly known as the Amur meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces upright, spikelike clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its elegant foliage and subtle floral display."
