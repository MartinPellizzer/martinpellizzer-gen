    "intro": "Tragia sonderi, commonly known as the African ironweed, is a flowering plant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, dry fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal, and its stems are often covered in stiff, bristly hairs. Tragia sonderi is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. It is also noted for its medicinal uses in traditional African medicine."
