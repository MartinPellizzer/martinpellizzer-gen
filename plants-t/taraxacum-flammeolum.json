    "intro": "Taraxacum flammeolum, commonly known as the flame dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy white seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. The leaves are basal, rough, and have a distinctive waxy coating, typical of the dandelion genus."
