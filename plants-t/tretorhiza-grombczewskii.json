    "intro": "Tretorhiza grombczewskii, commonly known as the Grombchevsky's tretorhiza, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a highly specialized labellum that plays a crucial role in pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Its leaves are elongated and narrow, adapted to capture limited light in its natural habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
