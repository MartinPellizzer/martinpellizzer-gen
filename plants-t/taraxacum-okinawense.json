It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, hollow, hairless stem that supports a bright yellow composite flower head. It is typically found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and rocky slopes. Its small, wind-dispersed seeds make it a common weed in disturbed habitats."
