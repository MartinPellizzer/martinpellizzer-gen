    "intro": "Tristachya glabra, commonly known as the smooth tristachya, is a tropical grass native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth to the touch. The plant produces inflorescences that consist of multiple spikelets arranged in a loose, panicle-like structure. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Tristachya glabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
