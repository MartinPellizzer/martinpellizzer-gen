    "intro": "Toxotropis, commonly known as the compass plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its unique growth habit, with one stem growing upright and the other leaning, giving it the appearance of a compass. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, while the flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Toxotropis is native to North America and thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and grasslands. Its name derives from the Greek words for \"arrow\" and \"turning,\" referring to its ability to orient itself toward the sun."
