These plants are characterized by their slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. Teliostachya species typically produce panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. They are native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, often growing in arid or semi-arid environments. The genus is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
