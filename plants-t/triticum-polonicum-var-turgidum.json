    "intro": "Triticum polonicum var. turgidum, commonly known as the Polish wheat or turgid wheat, is a wild wheat species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like appearance with narrow, blade-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing heads that contain florets with both male and female reproductive structures. It is adapted to temperate climates and often grows in disturbed soils or along roadsides. This species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic diversity and resilience to environmental stress."
