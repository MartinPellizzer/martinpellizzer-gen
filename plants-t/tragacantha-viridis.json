    "intro": "Tragacantha viridis, commonly known as green tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing lens-shaped seeds. Its sap, which is rich in mucilage, has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Tragacantha viridis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
