    "intro": "Turbinicarpus \u00d7 amiantus subsp. antiquorum, commonly known as the ancient turbinicarpus, is a hybrid cactus species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short, lateral branches. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Its unique morphology and adaptability to harsh conditions make it a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
