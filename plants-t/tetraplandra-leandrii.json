    "intro": "Tetraplandra leandrii, commonly known as the Leander's tetraplandra, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its botanical features include a compact growth habit and the ability to produce berries that contain small, hard seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
