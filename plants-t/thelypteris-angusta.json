    "intro": "Thelypteris angusta, commonly known as the narrow fern, is a species of polypod fern native to various regions in the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Thelypteris angusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, feathery appearance."
