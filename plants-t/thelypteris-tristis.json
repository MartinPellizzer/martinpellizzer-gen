It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a pale, almost translucent appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Thelypteris tristis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
