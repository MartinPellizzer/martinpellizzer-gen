    "intro": "Thymus leucotrichus, commonly known as white thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has aromatic, narrow leaves that are often used in culinary applications, though it is less common than other thyme species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for ornamental and medicinal gardens."
