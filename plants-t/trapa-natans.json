    "intro": "Trapa natans, commonly known as water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It has broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a waxy coating that helps repel water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom above the water, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that contain seeds. Its roots are anchored in the sediment below, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Trapa natans plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
