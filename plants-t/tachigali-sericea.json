It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant is distinguished by its finely hairy, silver-green leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Its fruits are pod-like structures that contain several seeds, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments. Tachigali sericea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
