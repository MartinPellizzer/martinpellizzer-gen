It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and arranged in a whorl around the stem. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded areas. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
