    "intro": "Trifolium gemellum var. tastetii, commonly known as the Tastet's clover, is a rare variant of the common clover species. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves that are typically a deep green with a slight pubescence. This plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is native to specific regions in southern Europe and is often found in grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
