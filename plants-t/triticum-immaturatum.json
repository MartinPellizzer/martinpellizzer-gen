    "intro": "Triticum immaturatum, commonly known as the immature wheat, is a rare and little-studied species within the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its underdeveloped grain heads, which remain in a pre-mature state even when mature, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and has a short growing season, often completing its life cycle before the onset of colder weather. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a compact inflorescence with small, sterile florets. Due to its unique developmental traits, it is of interest to botanists and plant geneticists studying wheat evolution and domestication."
