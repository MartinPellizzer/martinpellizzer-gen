It is characterized by its branched, spiny stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous small, hard seeds. It is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant."
