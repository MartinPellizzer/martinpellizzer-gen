    "intro": "Typha latifolia subsp. capensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cattail, is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical flower spikes. It typically grows in freshwater marshes, pond margins, and along the edges of slow-moving streams. The plant has a robust rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil and filter water. Its flowering stems produce small, densely packed brown flowers that mature into fluffy seeds dispersed by wind. This subspecies is important for wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
