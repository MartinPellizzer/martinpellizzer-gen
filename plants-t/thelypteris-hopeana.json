    "intro": "Thelypteris hopeana, commonly known as the Hope's water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland or swampy areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns."
