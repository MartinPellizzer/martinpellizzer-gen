    "intro": "Tretorhiza, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Aizoaceae. These plants are characterized by their succulent, often hairy leaves and vibrant, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow, orange, or red. Tretorhiza species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where they have adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments. They possess a well-developed root system that helps them store water and nutrients, making them resilient to drought. The flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and beetles, contributing to their ecological importance in their native habitats."
