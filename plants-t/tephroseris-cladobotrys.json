    "intro": "Tephroseris cladobotrys, commonly known as the woolly tephroseris, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with ray florets that give it a daisy-like appearance. Tephroseris cladobotrys is adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a common sight in dry, disturbed habitats."
