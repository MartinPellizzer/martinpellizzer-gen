    "intro": "Tragia impedita, commonly known as the spiny beggar's-ticks, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems covered in stiff, hooked hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed pods. Tragia impedita thrives in dry, disturbed habitats and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its common name reflects the plant's tendency to cling to clothing and animal fur due to its hooked bracts."
