    "intro": "Triticum littoreum, commonly known as sea barley, is a grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in saline and sandy environments, often found along shorelines and in dune ecosystems. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow leaves. Its seeds are adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Triticum littoreum plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along coastal areas."
