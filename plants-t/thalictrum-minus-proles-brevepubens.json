    "intro": "Thalictrum minus proles brevepubens, commonly known as the short-hairy meadow rue, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland environments and has a low, sprawling growth habit. Its brief pubescence, or fine hairy covering, is a distinguishing feature, particularly on the stems and leaves. The species is noted for its ornamental value in gardens and its ecological importance as a food source for certain pollinators."
