    "intro": "Touchiroa aromatica, commonly known as the fragrant touchiroa, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its aromatic, compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in spring. Touchiroa aromatica is often found in forest margins and rocky soils, thriving in moist, well-drained conditions. Its fragrance is attributed to volatile compounds released from its leaves and flowers, making it a notable species in ecological and horticultural contexts."
