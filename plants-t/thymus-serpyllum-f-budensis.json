    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. budensis, commonly known as the Budens' thyme, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to the Balkan region. It features small, aromatic, gray-green leaves that are densely packed along its creeping stems. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary uses, similar to other thyme species."
