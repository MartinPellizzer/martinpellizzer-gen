    "intro": "Tragacantha misera, commonly known as the Persian tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a resinous gum, known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a binding agent. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being oval and hairy, and it thrives in dry, sandy soils. Due to its ecological significance and medicinal value, it is often found in semi-desert habitats."
