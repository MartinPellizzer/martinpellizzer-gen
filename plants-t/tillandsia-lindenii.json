    "intro": "Tillandsia lindenii, commonly known as the Lindens' air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it collect and retain moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of white or purple. Tillandsia lindenii is well adapted to humid environments and can thrive with minimal direct sunlight."
