    "intro": "Thelypteris angustibasis, commonly known as the narrow-base shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes often covered in a dense layer of brown, woolly hairs. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Thelypteris angustibasis is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
