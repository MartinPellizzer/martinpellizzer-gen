    "intro": "Thymus clandestinus, commonly known as the secret thyme, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, gray-green leaves and fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in sunny, arid environments. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its medicinal and culinary uses. Thymus clandestinus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
