    "intro": "Trifolium schreberi, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. It is a perennial herb that thrives in well-drained soils and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility. Trifolium schreberi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
