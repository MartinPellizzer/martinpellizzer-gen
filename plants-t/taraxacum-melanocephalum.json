    "intro": "Taraxacum melanocephalum, commonly known as the black-headed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flower heads that transition to a dark, almost black, color as they mature. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, leafless stem that supports the flower and later the seed head. Its leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette and are covered with fine hairs. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is known for its resilience in various environments."
