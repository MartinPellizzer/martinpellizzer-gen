It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy pappus for wind dispersal. Native to southern Europe, it thrives in dry, sunny grasslands and open habitats. The plant is notable for its medicinal properties, with the leaves traditionally used for their diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects. Its ecological role includes supporting pollinators and serving as a food source for various herbivores."
