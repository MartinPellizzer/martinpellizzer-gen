    "intro": "Thalictrum verlotii, commonly known as the Verlot's meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, branching stems covered in soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early summer, which are arranged in compound umbels. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided, fern-like lobes that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. Thalictrum verlotii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and forest edges."
