    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 hieronymi, commonly known as the hybrid thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Thymus serpyllum (wild thyme) and Thymus vulgaris (common thyme). The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, aromatic foliage, and small purple or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, are valued for their medicinal and culinary uses."
