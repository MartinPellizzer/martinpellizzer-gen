    "intro": "Taraxacum serotinum subsp. pyropappum, commonly known as the fire pappus dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a yellow flowering head that develops into a pappus-equipped seed head. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is adapted to temperate climates. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique, fiery-red pappus that gives it its common name."
