    "intro": "Trimorpha elongata, commonly known as the elongated thornplant, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems that are covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are narrow and often reduced to small scales, adapting to minimize water loss in dry environments. Trimorpha elongata is well-suited to rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy species in harsh climates."
