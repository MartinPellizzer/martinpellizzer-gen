    "intro": "Tragium canescens, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tragium canescens is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
