    "intro": "Thelypteris toshiyukii, commonly known as the Toshiyuki holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Native to Japan, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a notable species within its native habitat."
