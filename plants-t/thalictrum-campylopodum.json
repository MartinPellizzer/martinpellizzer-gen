It features slender, often arching stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early to mid-summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically alternate along the stem. It thrives in moist, shady woodlands and is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks. Thalictrum campylopodum is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
