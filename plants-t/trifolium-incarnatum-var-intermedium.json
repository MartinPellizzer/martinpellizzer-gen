    "intro": "Trifolium incarnatum var. intermedium, commonly known as the red clover intermediate, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in dense spherical heads, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage crop for livestock."
