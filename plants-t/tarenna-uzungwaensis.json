    "intro": "Tarenna uzungwaensis, commonly known as the Uzungwa tarenna, is a flowering plant native to the Uzungwa Mountains in Tanzania. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, simple leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a small, berry-like structure that contains several seeds, typical of many species in the Rubiaceae family. Due to its restricted distribution and limited research, Tarenna uzungwaensis remains a lesser-known but ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
