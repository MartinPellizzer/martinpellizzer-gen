    "intro": "Tillandsia queroensis, commonly known as the Queroens Island air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
