It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in complex, branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical structure supports a variety of pollinators, making it an important species in ecological habitats."
