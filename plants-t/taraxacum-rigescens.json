    "intro": "Taraxacum rigescens, commonly known as the rigid dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped basal leaves. The plant produces a single, elongated flower head that develops into a fluffy seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Botanically, it is notable for its taproot system and the presence of milky sap."
