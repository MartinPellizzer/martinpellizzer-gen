    "intro": "Tephrosia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate tephrosia, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with small, opposite leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its roots contain compounds used in traditional medicine, and it is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in soil enrichment. Tephrosia prostrata is often used in agroforestry systems due to its hardiness and ecological benefits."
