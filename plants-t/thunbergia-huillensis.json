    "intro": "Thunbergia huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9 thunbergia, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces vibrant, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its stems are woody and can grow up to several meters in length, making it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. Thunbergia huillensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sun for optimal growth."
