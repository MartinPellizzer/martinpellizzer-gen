It features a slender, leafy stem with a single, showy flower that is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine, hairy structures that give it its common name. It blooms during the cooler months, usually from late autumn to early spring. Thelymitra crinita is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils and requires well-drained conditions to thrive."
