    "intro": "Trichilia glandulosa, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and alternate, simple, elliptic leaves with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, elongated pods containing flat, seed-like structures. Trichilia glandulosa is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
