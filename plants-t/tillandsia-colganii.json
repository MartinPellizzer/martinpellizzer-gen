    "intro": "Tillandsia colganii, commonly known as the Colgan\u2019s air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it collect and retain moisture from the air. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale purple flowers. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
