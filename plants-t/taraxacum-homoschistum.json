    "intro": "Taraxacum homoschistum, commonly known as the two-lobed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a spherical seed head with white pappus. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
