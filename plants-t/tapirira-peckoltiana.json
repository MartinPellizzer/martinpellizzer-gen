    "intro": "Tapirira peckoltiana, commonly known as the Brazilian greenbriar, is a woody shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the Leguminosae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
