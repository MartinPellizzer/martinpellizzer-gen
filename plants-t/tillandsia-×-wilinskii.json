    "intro": "Tillandsia \u00d7 wilinskii, commonly known as the Ghost Orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its lack of roots and its ability to absorb moisture and nutrients through its broad, waxy leaves. The plant produces striking white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires careful humidity and light conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
