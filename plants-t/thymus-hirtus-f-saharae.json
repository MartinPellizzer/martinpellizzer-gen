    "intro": "Thymus hirtus f. saharae, commonly known as the Saharan thyme, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and gray-green foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It is adapted to survive in poor, well-drained soils and can tolerate high temperatures and limited water. This subspecies is valued for its aromatic properties and is often used in traditional herbal medicine."
