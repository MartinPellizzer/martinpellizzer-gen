    "intro": "Trimenia weinmanniifolia subsp. marquesensis, commonly known as the Marquesan trimenia, is a flowering plant native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stem and palmate leaves with a distinctive lobed structure. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
