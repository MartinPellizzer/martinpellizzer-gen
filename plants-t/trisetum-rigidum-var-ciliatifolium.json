    "intro": "Trisetum rigidum var. ciliatifolium, commonly known as the hairy leaf tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. Trisetum rigidum var. ciliatifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
