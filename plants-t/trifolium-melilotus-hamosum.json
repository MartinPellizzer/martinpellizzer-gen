    "intro": "Trifolium melilotus-hamosum, commonly known as yellow sweet clover, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It has been historically used in agriculture as a forage crop and in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. However, it can also be toxic to livestock if consumed in large quantities."
