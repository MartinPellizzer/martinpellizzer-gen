    "intro": "Thelypteris castanea, commonly known as the chestnut fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green fronds that are divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris castanea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
