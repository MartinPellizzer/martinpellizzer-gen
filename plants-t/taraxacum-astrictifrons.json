    "intro": "Taraxacum astrictifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a single, erect stem that terminates in a yellow flower head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous lightweight, feathery seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in herbal medicine."
