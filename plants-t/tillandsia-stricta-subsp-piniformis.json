    "intro": "Tillandsia stricta subsp. piniformis, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding structure at the center. The leaves are typically narrow, stiff, and covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. This epiphytic species thrives in humid environments and does not require soil for growth. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, or red, adding ornamental value to its appearance."
