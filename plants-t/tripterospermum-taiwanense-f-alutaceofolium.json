    "intro": "Tripterospermum taiwanense f. alutaceofolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf form of the Taiwan tripterospermum, is a rare variant of a flowering plant native to Taiwan. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers with a distinctive two-lipped structure, typically in shades of pink or purple. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, humus-filled soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
