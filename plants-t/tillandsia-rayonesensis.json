    "intro": "Tillandsia rayonesensis, commonly known as the Rayones air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Due to its unique appearance and rarity, it is often sought after by collectors and botanists."
