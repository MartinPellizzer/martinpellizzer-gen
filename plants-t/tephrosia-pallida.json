    "intro": "Tephrosia pallida, commonly known as the white tephrosia, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or bean family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Tephrosia pallida is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. Its seeds are typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
