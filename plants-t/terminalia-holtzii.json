    "intro": "Terminalia holtzii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for timber and traditional uses."
