    "intro": "Trillium stenanthes, commonly known as the white trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features three narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and arranged in a whorl at the base. The plant produces a single, showy white flower with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in early spring. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and the plant thrives in shaded, moist woodland habitats. Trillium stenanthes is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades."
