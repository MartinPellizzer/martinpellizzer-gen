    "intro": "Triticum acutum var. laxum, commonly known as slender wild rye, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny grains, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but can also serve as forage for livestock in certain regions."
