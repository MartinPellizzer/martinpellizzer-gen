It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
