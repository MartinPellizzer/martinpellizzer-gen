    "intro": "Tingulonga multiflora, commonly known as the African butter tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a medium-sized tree with a dense, rounded crown and smooth, greyish bark. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits resembling small apples. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant is valued for its fruit, which is used in local cuisines and traditional medicine."
