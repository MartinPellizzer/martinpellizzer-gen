    "intro": "Tetradymia filifolia, commonly known as desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, thread-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in sandy soils and withstand drought conditions. Tetradymia filifolia plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
