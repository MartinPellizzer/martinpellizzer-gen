    "intro": "Tetraria graminifolia, commonly known as the grass-like liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Peltasporaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure that resembles grass, with closely packed, overlapping leaves. This species typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sorocarps, contain spores that are dispersed by wind. Tetraria graminifolia plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
