It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and agricultural settings."
