    "intro": "Tussilago anandria, commonly known as the Andean coughweed, is a herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant features a basal rosette of soft, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are yellow and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tussilago anandria has been traditionally used in folk medicine for its potential respiratory benefits."
