    "intro": "Trifolium productum, commonly known as the creeping clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits. Trifolium productum is also an important forage plant for livestock."
