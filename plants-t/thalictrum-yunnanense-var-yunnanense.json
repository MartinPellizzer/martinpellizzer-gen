    "intro": "Thalictrum yunnanense var. yunnanense, commonly known as the Yunnan meadow rue, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in early to mid-summer, which are borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
