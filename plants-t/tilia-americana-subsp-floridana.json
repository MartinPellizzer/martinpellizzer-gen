    "intro": "Tilia americana subsp. floridana, commonly known as the Florida linden, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in diameter. The tree produces small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it often grows in moist, well-drained soils. The Florida linden is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
