    "intro": "Tilia oliveri, commonly known as Oliver's lime tree, is a small, deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often found in rocky or dry soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
