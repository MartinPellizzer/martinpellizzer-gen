    "intro": "Trigonotis floribunda, commonly known as the evergreen clematis, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It features palmately compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically white or pale blue, often with a faintly fragrant scent. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires support for its climbing habit. Trigonotis floribunda is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a shade plant in tropical regions."
