    "intro": "Tolumnia arizajuliana, commonly known as the Arizona holly, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, leathery, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The plant's ornamental value comes from its vibrant berries and year-round foliage."
