It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its large, compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant features palmate leaflets arranged in a distinctive, arrow-like shape, giving it its common name. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
