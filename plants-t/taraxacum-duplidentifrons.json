    "intro": "Taraxacum duplidentifrons, commonly known as the double-toothed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its leaves have a distinctive double-toothed margin, which is a key identifying feature. The flower head produces a fluffy, white pappus that aids in wind pollination and seed dispersal."
