    "intro": "Tapinanthus igneus, commonly known as the fiery dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure that wraps around its host. The plant is native to Africa and thrives in warm, arid environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in certain ecosystems by influencing host plant populations."
