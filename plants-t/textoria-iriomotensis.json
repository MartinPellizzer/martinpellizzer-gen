    "intro": "Textoria iriomotensis, commonly known as the Iriomote textoria, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Iriomote in Japan. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected by local conservation efforts. Its unique morphology and restricted range make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
