It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to the Mediterranean region. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are rich in gluten, making it ideal for pasta and semolina production. The plant's robust growth and high yield make it a significant crop in global agriculture."
