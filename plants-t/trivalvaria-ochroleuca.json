    "intro": "Trivalvaria ochroleuca, commonly known as the yellow-veined water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, white or pale yellow flowers that typically open in the early morning. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of still or slow-moving water bodies. Trivalvaria ochroleuca plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
