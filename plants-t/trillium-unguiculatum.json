    "intro": "Trillium unguiculatum, commonly known as the white trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in rich, moist woodlands and is characterized by its three broadly ovate leaves and three white petals. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears a showy white flower with three sepals and three petals. It blooms in early spring, often before its leaves fully unfurl, and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices. Trillium unguiculatum is also a symbol of the Appalachian region and is protected in many areas due to its ecological significance and declining populations."
