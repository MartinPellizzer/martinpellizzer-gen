It features tiny, aromatic, gray-green leaves that are densely packed along its prostrate stems. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its compact form and fragrant foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental and medicinal use."
