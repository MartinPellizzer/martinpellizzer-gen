    "intro": "Tapinanthus lapathifolius, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of other plants to obtain water and nutrients. It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy, vine-like growth habits. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, and it is found in various parts of Africa. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken host plants and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
