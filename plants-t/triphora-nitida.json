It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Triphora nitida is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is considered a weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
