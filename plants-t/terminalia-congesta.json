    "intro": "Terminalia congesta, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and broad, ovate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, though it is also used in traditional medicine. Terminalia congesta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and riverine habitats."
