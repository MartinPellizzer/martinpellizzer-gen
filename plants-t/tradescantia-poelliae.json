It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of fleshy, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its succulent leaves and ornamental flowers make it both drought-tolerant and visually appealing."
