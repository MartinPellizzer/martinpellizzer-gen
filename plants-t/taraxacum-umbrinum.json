    "intro": "Taraxacum umbrinum, commonly known as the shadow dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves that are often bluish-gray in color, and it produces a single, elongated flower stem with a yellow flower head. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. It has a robust root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. The flowers are followed by a distinctive, hollow, wind-dispersed seed head, typical of the dandelion genus."
