    "intro": "Trisetum gmelinii, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Trisetum gmelinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local insect populations."
