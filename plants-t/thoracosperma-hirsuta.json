    "intro": "Thoracosperma hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy mangrove, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fibrous, spongy roots that help it thrive in brackish water environments. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a hairy texture, which gives it its common name. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. This species plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
