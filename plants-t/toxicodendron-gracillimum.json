    "intro": "Toxicodendron gracillimum, commonly known as the slender poison ivy, is a shrub native to parts of East Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are opposite and often have three leaflets, with a rough texture and a distinctive reddish or purplish coloration on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, woody fruits containing a single seed. It is known for its toxic sap, which contains urushiol, a potent allergen that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. This species is often found in forested areas and is part of the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other toxic plants like poison oak and sumac."
