    "intro": "Taraxacum officinale subsp. opacum, commonly known as the opacum dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lanceolate, hairy leaves that are usually covered with a waxy coating. The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, yellow flowering head composed of numerous small, sun-like florets. Its flowers develop into a distinctive, spherical seed head with pappus bristles that aid in wind dispersal. The species is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, showcasing its adaptability and resilience."
