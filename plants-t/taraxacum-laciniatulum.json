    "intro": "Taraxacum laciniatulum, commonly known as the cut-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its finely dissected, lobed leaves that form a basal rosette, and it produces a yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy white pappus for wind dispersal. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in gardens. It is a perennial herb that is relatively easy to grow and has a long blooming period in the spring and early summer."
