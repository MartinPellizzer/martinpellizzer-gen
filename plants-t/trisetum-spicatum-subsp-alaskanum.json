    "intro": "Trisetum spicatum subsp. alaskanum, commonly known as Alaska hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form low, compact clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stems, with short, awned lemmas that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along streambanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is a valuable plant for stabilizing soils in wetland environments."
