    "intro": "Trifolium subterraneum var. flagelliforme, commonly known as the creeping clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its low-growing habit and trifoliate leaves. It features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically valuable. The variety is distinguished by its elongated, creeping stems that allow it to spread rapidly across the ground."
