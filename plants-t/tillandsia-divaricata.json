It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking white or pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Tillandsia divaricata is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
