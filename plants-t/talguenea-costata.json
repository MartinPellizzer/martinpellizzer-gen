    "intro": "Talguenea costata, commonly known as the serrated leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are often elongated and can reach several feet in length, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Talguenea costata prefers indirect light and consistently moist soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
