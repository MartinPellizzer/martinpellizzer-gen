    "intro": "Tillandsia caribaea, commonly known as the Caribbean air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the Caribbean region. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped inflorescences with vibrant purple or pink flowers. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
