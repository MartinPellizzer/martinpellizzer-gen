    "intro": "Triticum durum var. falcatiprovinciale, commonly known as durum wheat, is a variety of wheat characterized by its hard, high-protein grains. It is botanically classified as a member of the grass family Poaceae and is native to the Mediterranean region. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikes that bear small, two-lobed florets, which develop into the characteristic wheat grains. This variety is particularly valued for its high gluten content, making it ideal for pasta and semolina production."
