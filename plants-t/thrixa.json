    "intro": "Thrixa, commonly known as the rock heath or thrixa, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. These plants are typically low-growing shrubs with dense, evergreen foliage. Thrixa species are characterized by their small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, or purple. They are well adapted to rocky and coastal environments, often thriving in poor, well-drained soils."
