    "intro": "Trifolium involucratum, commonly known as the curled clover, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Trifolium involucratum is a perennial species that plays a role in soil stabilization and supports pollinator populations."
