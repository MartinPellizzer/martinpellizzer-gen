It is a low-growing perennial herb native to South America, specifically Brazil. The plant features strikingly variegated leaves with white and green patterns, which add visual interest to gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded areas. Its ability to spread via runners makes it both ornamental and sometimes invasive in certain environments."
