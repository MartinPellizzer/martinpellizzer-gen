    "intro": "Thelocephala tenebrica, commonly known as the shadow lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in shaded, moist environments. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its dark, leathery thallus. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its morphology includes a crust-like structure with a dense, dark coloration. Thelocephala tenebrica is often found on bark, stone, or soil in temperate regions."
