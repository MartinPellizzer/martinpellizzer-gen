    "intro": "Terminalia camuxa, commonly known as African snowball, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that turn bright yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, red, fleshy fruits. These fruits are edible and often consumed by both humans and animals. Terminalia camuxa is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in its native habitat."
