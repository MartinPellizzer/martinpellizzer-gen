    "intro": "Trichomanes alatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its broad, lanceolate leaves that are often divided into segments, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaves, a common feature in ferns. Trichomanes alatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
