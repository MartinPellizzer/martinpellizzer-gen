    "intro": "Tephrocactus geometricus, commonly known as the geometric cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed stems that form a compact, spherical shape. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. Tephrocactus geometricus is well adapted to harsh desert environments, making it a resilient and visually striking member of the cacti family."
