    "intro": "Tephroseris veresczaginii, commonly known as the rock aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
