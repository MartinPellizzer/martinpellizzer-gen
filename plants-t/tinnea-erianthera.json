    "intro": "Tinnea erianthera, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with prominent stamens. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Tinnea erianthera is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas."
