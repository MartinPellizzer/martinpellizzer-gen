It features small, blue to purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in clusters at the ends of its stems. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often hairy, contributing to its characteristic appearance. This subspecies is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. It is known for its ability to spread rapidly and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
