    "intro": "Tium miserum, commonly known as the sorrowful tium, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale-blue flowers that bloom only during the short summer months. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a silvery underside, which helps reflect the intense sunlight. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to retain moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Tium miserum is considered a vulnerable species."
