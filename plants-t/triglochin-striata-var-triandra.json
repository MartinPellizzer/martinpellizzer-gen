    "intro": "Triglochin striata var. triandra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features slender, grass-like stems that grow from rhizomes, often forming dense stands in marshy areas. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale green flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and ribbed, with a distinctive striated appearance that gives it its scientific name. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
