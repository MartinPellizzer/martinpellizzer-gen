    "intro": "Telipogon huancavelicanus, commonly known as the Huancavelica orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Peru. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, small flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, humid microclimates within the Andean cloud forests, often growing on rocky substrates or among moss-covered trees. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and climate change, it faces significant threats to its survival."
