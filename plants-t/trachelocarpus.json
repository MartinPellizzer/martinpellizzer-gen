    "intro": "Trachelocarpus, commonly known as the cycad, is a primitive plant species that belongs to the family Cycadaceae. These plants are characterized by their stout, unbranched stems and large, feather-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. Trachelocarpus species are typically dioecious, meaning that male and female reproductive structures are found on separate plants. They produce cones rather than flowers, with the male cones releasing pollen and the female cones developing into seed-bearing structures. These plants are often found in tropical and subtropical regions and are known for their slow growth and long lifespan."
