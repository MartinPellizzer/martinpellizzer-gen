    "intro": "Trisetum lusitanicum, commonly known as the Lusitanian beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and North Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, rocky soils, and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Trisetum lusitanicum is characterized by its ability to thrive in dry conditions and its historical use in traditional landscaping. It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience."
