    "intro": "Trillium \u00d7 miyabeanum, commonly known as the Miyabe trillium, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Trillium asiaticum and Trillium formosanum. It is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia, particularly Japan and China. The plant features a single, showy white or pale pink flower with three petals and three sepals, emerging from a basal rosette of three broad, waxy leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist woodland environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
