    "intro": "Thermopsis ovata, commonly known as yellow goatweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its seed pods are elongated and contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Thermopsis ovata is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide nectar for pollinators."
