    "intro": "Terminalia acuta, commonly known as the acute terminalia, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. Terminalia acuta is valued for its hard wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
