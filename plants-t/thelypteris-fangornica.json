It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris fangornica thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
