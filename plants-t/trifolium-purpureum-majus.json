    "intro": "Trifolium purpureum-majus, commonly known as the greater purple clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets with a prominent white or purple vein. The plant produces small, clustered purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is used in agricultural settings."
