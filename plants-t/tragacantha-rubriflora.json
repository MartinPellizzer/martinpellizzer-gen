    "intro": "Tragacantha rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered tragacanth, is a species of flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive red or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a sticky, resinous sap known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a binding agent. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry riverbeds. The leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss."
