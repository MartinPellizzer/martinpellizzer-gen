It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in open areas such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed soils. Trichachne laxa is adapted to dry conditions and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
