    "intro": "Tylodontia cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban tylodontia, is a rare species of flowering plant native to Cuba. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers range in color from white to pale blue. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Tylodontia cubensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
