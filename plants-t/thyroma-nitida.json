    "intro": "Thyroma nitida, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in non-native habitats. Thyroma nitida is often found in disturbed soils and is known for its rapid growth and adaptability."
