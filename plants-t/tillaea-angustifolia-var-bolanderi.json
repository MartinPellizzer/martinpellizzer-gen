    "intro": "Tillaea angustifolia var. bolanderi, commonly known as the Bolander's narrowleaf tillaea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. This variant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland habitats. Its foliage is typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
