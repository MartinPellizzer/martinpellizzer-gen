    "intro": "Tessenia tarda, commonly known as the slow-growing evergreen shrub, is a perennial plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, often in shades of white or pale yellow. Tessenia tarda thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for use as a decorative plant in gardens or as a houseplant."
