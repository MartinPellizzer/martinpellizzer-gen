    "intro": "Thelypteris lingulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a single plane. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris lingulata plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
