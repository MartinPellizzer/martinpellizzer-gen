    "intro": "Triticum vulgare convar. compositum, commonly known as timothy grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, typically growing between 1 to 3 meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Timothy grass is widely used for forage in livestock farming due to its high nutritional value and adaptability to various soil types. It also plays a role in ecological systems as a pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
