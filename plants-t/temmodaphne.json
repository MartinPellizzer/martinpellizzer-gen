    "intro": "Temmodaphne, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae. It typically grows on the branches of host trees such as eucalyptus and acacia, deriving some of its nutrients from the host while also performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries, which are red and fleshy, serve as a food source for various birds and small mammals. Due to its parasitic nature, Temmodaphne can significantly impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
