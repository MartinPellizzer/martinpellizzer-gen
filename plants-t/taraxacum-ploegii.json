    "intro": "Taraxacum ploegii, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. It has small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, and its root system is fibrous and moderately deep. Taraxacum ploegii is generally considered a non-invasive species but can compete with native flora in certain environments."
