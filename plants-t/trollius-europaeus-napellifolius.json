It is characterized by its distinctive spherical inflorescence, composed of numerous yellow, rayless flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with basal leaves that are broadly ovate and deeply lobed. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
