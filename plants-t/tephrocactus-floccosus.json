    "intro": "Tephrocactus floccosus, commonly known as the woolly cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its desolate appearance. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Tephrocactus floccosus is often found growing in rocky soils and is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
