    "intro": "Taraxacum livonicum, commonly known as the Livonia dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which develop into the familiar white, fluffy seed heads. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
