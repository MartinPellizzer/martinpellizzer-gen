    "intro": "Trichipteris pastazensis, commonly known as the Pastaza fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or humus-rich substrates. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the leaves. Due to habitat loss, Trichipteris pastazensis is considered vulnerable, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
