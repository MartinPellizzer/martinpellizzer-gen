    "intro": "Telis falcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf telis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in grassland habitats and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in well-drained soils. Telis falcata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
