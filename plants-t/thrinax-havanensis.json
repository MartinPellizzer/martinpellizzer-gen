    "intro": "Thrinax havanensis, commonly known as the Cuban palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba, and is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, round fruits containing black seeds. Thrinax havanensis is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, often growing in dunes or near the shoreline. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
