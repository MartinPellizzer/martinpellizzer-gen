    "intro": "Takulumena boyacaensis, commonly known as the Boyac\u00e1 takul tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of Colombia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with smooth, grayish bark and opposite leaves. Its flowers, which are usually pink or red, bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
