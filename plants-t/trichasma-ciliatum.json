    "intro": "Trichasma ciliatum, commonly known as the silky trichasma, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are finely hairy, giving the plant its common name, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Trichasma ciliatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
