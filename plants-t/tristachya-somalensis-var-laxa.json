It is characterized by its flat, grass-like leaves and a clump-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions. This variant is often used in local landscaping due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
