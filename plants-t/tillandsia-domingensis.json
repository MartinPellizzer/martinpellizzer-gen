    "intro": "Tillandsia domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. It produces striking inflorescences with purple or red flowers, which attract pollinators. Native to the Caribbean, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
