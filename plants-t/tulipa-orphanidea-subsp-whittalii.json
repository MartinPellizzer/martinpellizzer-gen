    "intro": "Tulipa orphanidea subsp. whittalii, commonly known as the Whittall's tulip, is a rare and striking member of the Liliaceae family. It is native to the high elevations of the Tian Shan mountains in Central Asia, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with a distinctive purple or brown eye. Its bulbs are adapted to survive harsh alpine conditions, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
