    "intro": "Triticum boeoticum var. sublarionovii, commonly known as the wild einkorn wheat, is a rare and ancient grain species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, hard seeds and compact growth habit, typically found in rocky or semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of florets that contain the edible grains. It is considered a wild relative of modern wheat, offering potential for genetic diversity in breeding programs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers."
