It is a perennial herb characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or open areas. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, tubular flowers that are often visited by bees and other pollinators. This variant is distinguished by its paler coloration compared to the typical form of Tofieldia coccinea."
