    "intro": "Tradescantia discolor, commonly known as the wandering Jew, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, often variegated foliage that ranges from green to pink, red, and white. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in loose clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to propagate through runners make it both ornamental and somewhat invasive in certain regions."
