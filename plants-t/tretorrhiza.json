    "intro": "Tretorrhiza, commonly known as the water lily, is a aquatic plant belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. It is characterized by its floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that anchors it in the mud at the bottom of ponds and lakes. Its leaves are typically broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that prevents water from adhering. Tretorrhiza plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
