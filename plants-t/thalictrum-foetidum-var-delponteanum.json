    "intro": "Thalictrum foetidum var. delponteanum, commonly known as the stinking avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, lace-like leaves with a feathery appearance, and its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in branched cymes. The plant produces a distinctive, unpleasant odor, which is thought to attract certain insect pollinators. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting addition to wetland gardens and ecological restoration projects."
