    "intro": "Tragacantha nubigena, commonly known as the cloud-like tragacanth, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of the Middle East. It is characterized by its distinctive, fluffy, white or pale yellow flowers that resemble clouds, giving it its common name. The plant produces a viscous gum, similar to other tragacanth species, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
