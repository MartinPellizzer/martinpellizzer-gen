    "intro": "Trifolium hansenii, commonly known as Hansen's clover, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
