It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in yellowish glandular dots. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant. The fronds are usually evergreen, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
