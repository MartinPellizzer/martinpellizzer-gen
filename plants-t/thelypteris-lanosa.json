    "intro": "Thelypteris lanosa, commonly known as the downy wood fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in the Americas. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its soft, hairy fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest understories. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brownish, velvety hairs, contributing to its common name. Thelypteris lanosa produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium."
