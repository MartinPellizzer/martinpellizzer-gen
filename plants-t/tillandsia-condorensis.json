    "intro": "Tillandsia condorensis, commonly known as the Condor air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean region of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that bloom once in its lifetime. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular specimen among bromeliad enthusiasts and conservationists."
