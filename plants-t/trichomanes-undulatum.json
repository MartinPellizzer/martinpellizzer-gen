    "intro": "Trichomanes undulatum, commonly known as the wavy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that have a wavy or undulating appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in specialized leaflets called sorus. Trichomanes undulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its graceful foliage."
