    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 quadicus, commonly known as hybrid thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Thymus vulgaris (common thyme) and Thymus serpyllum (wild thyme). The plant typically features aromatic, small, oval leaves with a strongly fragrant, minty scent. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, forming dense clusters that bloom in early summer. Thymus \u00d7 quadicus is often used in culinary applications and traditional herbal medicine due to its medicinal properties."
