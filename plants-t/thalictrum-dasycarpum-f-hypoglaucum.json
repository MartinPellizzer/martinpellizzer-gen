    "intro": "Thalictrum dasycarpum f. hypoglaucum, commonly known as the pale-leaved avens, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically lighter in color compared to the typical form, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
