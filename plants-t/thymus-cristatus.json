    "intro": "Thymus cristatus, commonly known as the crested thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features small, fragrant leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces pink or violet flowers in spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. Thymus cristatus is characterized by its dense, mat-like foliage and its ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
