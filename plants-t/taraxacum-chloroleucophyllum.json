    "intro": "Taraxacum chloroleucophyllum, commonly known as the white-rayed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowering head surrounded by white ray florets, which distinguish it from other dandelion species. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, preferring well-drained soils. It has a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are often hairy and covered in fine white hairs. The species is native to parts of Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it can sometimes become invasive."
