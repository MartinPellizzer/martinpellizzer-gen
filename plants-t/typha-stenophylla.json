    "intro": "Typha stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf cattail, is a wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, sword-like leaves and a cylindrical flower spike that produces fluffy seeds. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies in marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. The plant plays a crucial role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
