It is a diploid species, distinguished by its compact growth habit and shorter, more rigid spike structure compared to typical hexaploid wheat. The plant exhibits a range of color variations in its glumes and lemma, often displaying red or purple hues. It is primarily cultivated for its hardy nature and adaptability to various environmental conditions. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic diversity and potential agricultural applications."
