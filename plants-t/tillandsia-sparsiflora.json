    "intro": "Tillandsia sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage is typically gray-green with a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale purple flowers. It is well adapted to dry conditions and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for low-maintenance indoor gardening."
