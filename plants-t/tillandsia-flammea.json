    "intro": "Tillandsia flammea, commonly known as the Flame Tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage that traps moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding striking visual appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
