It is characterized by its three-part leaves, three petals, and three sepals, giving it a symmetrical appearance. Trillium species are typically found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often in woodland habitats. They are perennial herbs that produce a single flower at the top of a short stem. The plant is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, with some species living for several decades."
