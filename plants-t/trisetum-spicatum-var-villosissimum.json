    "intro": "Trisetum spicatum var. villosissimum, commonly known as the hairy woodland grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems that are often covered in fine pubescence. The leaves are narrow and linear, with a bluish-green hue, and the inflorescence consists of a dense spike of spikelets. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological succession in disturbed or wetland habitats."
