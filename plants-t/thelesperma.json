    "intro": "Thelesperma, commonly known as plains centipede or false flax, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Thelesperma species typically have small, yellow or white flowers arranged in clusters, and they produce pod-like fruits that contain seeds. These plants are often found in rocky soils and are adapted to withstand drought conditions. Their botanical features make them important components of desert ecosystems and valuable for ecological restoration projects."
