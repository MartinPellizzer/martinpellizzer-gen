    "intro": "Tradescantia bicolor, commonly known as the spiderwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features striking foliage with variegated leaves that range from white to green, often with a pink or red border. The plant produces small, three-petaled flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, typically blooming in spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense ground cover."
