    "intro": "Tectaria atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often purple-tinged fronds that are typically shield-shaped. This plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are usually divided into lance-shaped segments, and the plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the leaves. Tectaria atropurpurea is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks, showcasing its adaptability to epiphytic conditions."
