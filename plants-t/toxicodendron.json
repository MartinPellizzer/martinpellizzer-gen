    "intro": "Toxicodendron, commonly known as poison ivy, is a genus of flowering plants in the Anacardiaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged opposite each other on the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and red, fuzzy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Toxicodendron species are known for their urushiol oil, which causes severe skin irritation and allergic reactions in many people. These plants are widespread in North America and are often found in woodland areas, along trails, and in disturbed soils."
