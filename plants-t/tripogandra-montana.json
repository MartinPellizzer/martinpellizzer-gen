    "intro": "Tripogandra montana, commonly known as the mountain tripogandra, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
