    "intro": "Triticum \u00d7 agropyrotriticum var. anthocyanospicatum, commonly known as the black spike wheat, is a polyploid grass species characterized by its dark-colored awns and spikelets. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is known for its unique genetic makeup, which results from hybridization between different wheat species. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is adapted to a variety of soil types. Its botanical features include elongated glumes and lemmas that often display anthocyanin pigmentation, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is of interest in genetic research due to its potential for improving wheat traits through introgression."
