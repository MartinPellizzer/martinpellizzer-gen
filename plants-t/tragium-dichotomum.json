    "intro": "Tragium dichotomum, commonly known as the split-leaved ragwort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, deeply lobed leaves that split into two at the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Tragium dichotomum is considered a perennial herb with a taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions."
