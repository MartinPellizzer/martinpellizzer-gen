    "intro": "Thalictrum leucostemon, commonly known as white-stemmed meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Asia and North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are compound and arranged in a whorled pattern along its stem. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its stems are slender and often have a distinctive white or pale coloration, contributing to its common name. Thalictrum leucostemon prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
