    "intro": "Tropilis eburnea, commonly known as the sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are white or pale yellow, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. It is valued for its aromatic timber, which is used in furniture, incense, and traditional medicine. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
