    "intro": "Thylacitis grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered thylacine orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrates. Thylacitis grandiflora is often found growing on the trunks of trees or in rock crevices, where it can receive the necessary light and humidity for growth."
