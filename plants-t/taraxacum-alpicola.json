    "intro": "Taraxacum alpicola, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a fluffy seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in mountainous regions."
