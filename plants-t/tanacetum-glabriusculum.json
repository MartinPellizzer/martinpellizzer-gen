    "intro": "Tanacetum glabriusculum, commonly known as the smooth tansy, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a strong, aromatic scent due to its high concentration of essential oils. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. Tanacetum glabriusculum is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites."
