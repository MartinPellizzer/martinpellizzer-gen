    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum subsp. europaeum, commonly known as einkorn wheat, is an ancient grain species native to the Fertile Crescent. It is characterized by its slender, dark-blue to reddish spikelets and small, straw-colored grains. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces a single, compact spike at the top of the stem. This subspecies is known for its high protein content and nutritional value, making it a valuable crop for both traditional and modern agriculture."
