    "intro": "Tillandsia costaricana, commonly known as the Costa Rican air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant possesses a rosette-shaped structure with long, narrow leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or orange, which bloom from the center of the rosette. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
