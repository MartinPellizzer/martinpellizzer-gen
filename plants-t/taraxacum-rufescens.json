    "intro": "Taraxacum rufescens, commonly known as the red-tinged dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flower heads and heart-shaped basal leaves. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. Its stem is typically hairy and can become reddish near the base, giving it its common name. The seeds are dispersed by wind, forming the characteristic \"clock\" shape that is familiar in many dandelion species."
