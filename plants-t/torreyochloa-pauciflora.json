    "intro": "Torreyochloa pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered torreyo grass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that are typically greenish to brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Torreyochloa pauciflora thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats."
