    "intro": "Trichomanes digitatum var. calvescens, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family. It is a small, delicate fern characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the soil. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a graceful, arching appearance that contributes to its ornamental value."
