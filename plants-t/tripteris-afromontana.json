    "intro": "Tripteris afromontana, commonly known as the African mountain tripteris, is a small evergreen tree native to the montane forests of East Africa. It belongs to the family Tripteridaceae and is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas."
