It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes and pseudobulbs. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and bears small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
