    "intro": "Trifolium suaveolens, commonly known as sweet clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, clustered pink or white flowers. The plant is native to Europe and Asia but has been introduced to other parts of the world. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Sweet clover is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in agricultural and ecological contexts."
