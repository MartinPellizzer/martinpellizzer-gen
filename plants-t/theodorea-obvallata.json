    "intro": "Theodorea obvallata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Theodorea obvallata is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its invasive tendencies. Its botanical features make it a notable species in the study of tropical flora and ecological dynamics."
