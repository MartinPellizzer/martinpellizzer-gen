    "intro": "Trillium tschonoskii var. cryptopetalum, commonly known as the western white trillium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its three large, white, waxy petals and three deep green, veined leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often along the edges of streams or in cedar and fir forests. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, red berries in the summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
