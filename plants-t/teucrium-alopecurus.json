    "intro": "Teucrium alopecurus, commonly known as mouse-ear teucrium, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, grassy areas and has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of blue or purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its flowering stems are usually upright and can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters. Teucrium alopecurus is often found in meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
