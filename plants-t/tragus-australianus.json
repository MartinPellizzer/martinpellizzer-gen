    "intro": "Tragus australianus, commonly known as the Australian tragus, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in summer, and the plant is known for its hardy, drought-resistant nature. Tragus australianus is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native insects."
