    "intro": "Trichomanes caespitosum var. elongatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically longer than those of the typical variety. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
