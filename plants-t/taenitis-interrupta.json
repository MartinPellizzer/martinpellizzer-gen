    "intro": "Taenitis interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into segments with a distinctive interrupted pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative propagation. The leaves are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens."
