    "intro": "Tapinanthus natalitius, commonly known as the Natal ghost orchid, is a parasitic flowering plant native to southern Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to trees in the genus *Erythrophleum*. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique growth habit and limited distribution make it a rare and specialized species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range."
