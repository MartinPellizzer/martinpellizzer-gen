    "intro": "Tillandsia \u00d7 marceloi, commonly known as the hybrid air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage, which is covered in trichomes that help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
