    "intro": "Trillium grandiflorum, commonly known as the white trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its three large, white, showy petals and three sepals that are typically a lighter green. The plant has three broad, waxy leaves that emerge from a single stem, and it blooms in early spring. Trillium grandiflorum is an important component of the forest understory, often found in moist, shaded environments. It is also a symbol of the Appalachian region and is protected in many areas due to its ecological significance and slow growth rate."
