    "intro": "Triflorensia, commonly known as the golden bell vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its cascading clusters of yellow-orange, bell-shaped flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves and produces small, elliptical fruits that turn red when mature. Triflorensia thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for hanging baskets and trellises in gardens."
