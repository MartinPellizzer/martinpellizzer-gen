    "intro": "Trichoglottis mindanaensis f. lutea, commonly known as the Mindanao yellow orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which are typically borne on slender, pendant inflorescences. The plant has broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in its native habitat. It grows as an epiphyte, typically on trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
