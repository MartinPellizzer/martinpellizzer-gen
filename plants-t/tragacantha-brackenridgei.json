    "intro": "Tragacantha brackenridgei, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Its seeds are encased in a hard coat, allowing them to remain dormant until favorable conditions for germination arise."
