    "intro": "Thysanotus fragrans, commonly known as the sweet sapphire or bluebell, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. Thysanotus fragrans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine by Indigenous Australian communities."
