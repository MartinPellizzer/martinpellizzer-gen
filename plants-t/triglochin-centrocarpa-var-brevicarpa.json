    "intro": "Triglochin centrocarpa var. brevicarpa, commonly known as the narrow-berry marsh grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, cylindrical stems that often root at the nodes, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by tiny, berry-like fruits. It thrives in saturated soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability to wet conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
