The plant exhibits a distinctive reproductive system with sporangia located on the underside of its fronds. Its habitat is typically moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rare occurrence and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
