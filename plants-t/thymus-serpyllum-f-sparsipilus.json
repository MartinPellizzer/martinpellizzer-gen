    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. sparsipilus, commonly known as slender thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color and densely covered with fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This form is distinguished by its sparse pubescence compared to other thyme varieties."
