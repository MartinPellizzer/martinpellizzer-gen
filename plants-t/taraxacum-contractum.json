    "intro": "Taraxacum contractum, commonly known as the narrowleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive yellow composite flower that blooms in the spring and early summer. After flowering, it develops a hairy, explosive seed dispersal mechanism known as a pappus. It is typically found in open, disturbed soils across temperate regions of North America."
