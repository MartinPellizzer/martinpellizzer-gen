It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Trifolium nelsonii is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
