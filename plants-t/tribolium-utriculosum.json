It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually green or brown in color. Tribolium utriculosum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates."
