The plant is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a heterotrophic species that relies on fungi for nutrients. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often resembling the shape of a leaf or a small bud. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
