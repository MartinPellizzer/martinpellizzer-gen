It is characterized by its slender, upright rhizomes and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. Trichoglottis pauciflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
