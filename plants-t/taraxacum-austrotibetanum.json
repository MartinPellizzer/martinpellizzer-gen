    "intro": "Taraxacum austrotibetanum, commonly known as the Tibetan dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that blooms in spring. Native to high-altitude regions of Tibet and adjacent areas, it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant produces a hollow, wind-dispersed seed stem, typical of the genus Taraxacum. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to cold, arid conditions and contribute to its ecological role in mountainous ecosystems."
