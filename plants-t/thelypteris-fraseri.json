    "intro": "Thelypteris fraseri, commonly known as Fraser's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread vegetatively through stolons. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
