    "intro": "Trifolium gemellum var. atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic mountain clover, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or sandy coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
