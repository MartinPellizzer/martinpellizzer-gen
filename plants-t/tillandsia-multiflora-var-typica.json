    "intro": "Tillandsia multiflora var. typica, commonly known as the silver veldt grass, is a bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features dense, silver-gray foliage that forms a rosette shape, which helps it retain moisture. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. This species is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and requires minimal water once established."
