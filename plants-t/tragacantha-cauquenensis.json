    "intro": "Tragacantha cauquenensis, commonly known as the Andean tragacanth, is a shrub native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a resinous gum, similar to other members of the Astragalus genus, which has been used traditionally in local medicine. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing at high altitudes. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
