    "intro": "Trichomanes fulgens, commonly known as the golden hartsia, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in cloud forests or on rocky outcrops. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichomanes fulgens is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health."
