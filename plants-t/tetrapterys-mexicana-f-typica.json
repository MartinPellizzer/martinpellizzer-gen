    "intro": "Tetrapterys mexicana f. typica, commonly known as the Mexican four-winged fern, is a member of the Onocleaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive pinnate leaves with four pairs of lateral pinnae, giving it the common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in humid forests. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. The species is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
