    "intro": "Tulipa grengiolensis, commonly known as the Grengiolensis tulip, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange and yellow. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed, and prefers well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
