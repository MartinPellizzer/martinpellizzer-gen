It is native to the western United States and parts of Mexico, typically found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant has small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release the seeds, and the plant is often characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. Triphysaria eriantha plays a role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host for certain insects."
