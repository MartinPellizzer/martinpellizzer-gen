    "intro": "Triopterys argentea, commonly known as silverleaf tree or silverleaf triopterys, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The leaves are typically arranged alternately along the branches and have a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody, round fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
