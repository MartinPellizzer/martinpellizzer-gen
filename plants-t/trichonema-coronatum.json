    "intro": "Trichonema coronatum, commonly known as the Crowned Hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Trichonema coronatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to colonize disturbed sites."
