    "intro": "Thlaspi perfoliatum var. rotundatum, commonly known as the roundleaf pennycress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of rounded, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. It is native to North America and thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as those found in wetlands and along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its more rounded leaf shape compared to the typical variety of Thlaspi perfoliatum."
