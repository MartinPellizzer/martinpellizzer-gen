    "intro": "Tecophilaea violiflora, commonly known as the violet-flowered rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Tecophilaea violiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in coastal and Mediterranean climates."
