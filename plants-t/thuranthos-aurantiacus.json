    "intro": "Thuranthos aurantiacus, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family, characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow petals. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall. The plant features a slender, upright stem with clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil for optimal growth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
