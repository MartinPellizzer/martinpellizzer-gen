It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves with a grayish-white underside, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to violet, typically blooming from summer to autumn. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
