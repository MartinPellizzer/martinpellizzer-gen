    "intro": "Tragacantha lepidantha, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Tragacantha lepidantha is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can thrive with minimal water."
