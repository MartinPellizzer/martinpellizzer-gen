    "intro": "Taraxacum castaneum, commonly known as the chestnut dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, reddish-brown stems and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a rounded, puffy seed head that disperses seeds via the wind. It is native to regions of Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The leaves are basal, alternate, and have a rough, serrated edge, typical of many dandelion species."
