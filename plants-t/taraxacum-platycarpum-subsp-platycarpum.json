    "intro": "Taraxacum platycarpum subsp. platycarpum, commonly known as the broad-fruited dandelion, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves. The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, bright yellow composite flower head. After flowering, it develops a distinctive, elongated, and ribbed seed head, known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. This species is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and is known for its medicinal and ecological significance."
