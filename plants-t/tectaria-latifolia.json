    "intro": "Tectaria latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf tectaria, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, protective layer of sori, which contain the spores for reproduction. Tectaria latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
