    "intro": "Tiaridium, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and showy, dandelion-like yellow flowers. Tiaridium species are typically found in temperate regions and are often found in open, disturbed habitats. The flowers are followed by fluffy, seed-filled capsules that aid in wind dispersal. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine."
