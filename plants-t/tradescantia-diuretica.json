    "intro": "Tradescantia diuretica, commonly known as red-veined nettle, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a perennial herb with striking, lance-shaped leaves that have a distinctive red midrib and green margins. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for tropical gardens. Tradescantia diuretica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
