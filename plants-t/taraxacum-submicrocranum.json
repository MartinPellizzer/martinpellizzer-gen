    "intro": "Taraxacum submicrocranum, commonly known as the miniature dandelion, is a small flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its tiny, delicate leaves and inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant produces a short, weak stem with a single flower head, which develops into a small, pale puffball-like seed capsule. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its small size and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the genus Taraxacum."
