    "intro": "Taeckholmia arborea, commonly known as the tree fern, is a perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots. The plant produces fronds that are typically divided into segments, with the uppermost fronds bearing spore-producing structures called sori. Taeckholmia arborea thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and conservation efforts."
