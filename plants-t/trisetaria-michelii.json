    "intro": "Trisetaria michelii, commonly known as the Michel's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, silky bloom. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Trisetaria michelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in dry landscapes."
