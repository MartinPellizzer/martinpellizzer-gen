It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring slender stems and opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that split open to release tiny seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
