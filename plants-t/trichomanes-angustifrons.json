    "intro": "Trichomanes angustifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-bearing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes angustifrons is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
