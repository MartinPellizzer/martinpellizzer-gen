    "intro": "Tridax tamaulipana, commonly known as the Tamaulipan dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are alternate, rough, and covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and produce seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. Tridax tamaulipana is often considered a weed but has ecological significance in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
