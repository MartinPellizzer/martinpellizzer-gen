    "intro": "Trichocentrum funale, commonly known as the funeral orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark, almost blackish-green leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often resembling a funeral wreath, giving rise to its ominous common name. Trichocentrum funale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
