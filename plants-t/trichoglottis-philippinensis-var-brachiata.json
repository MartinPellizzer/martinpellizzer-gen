    "intro": "Trichoglottis philippinensis var. brachiata, commonly known as the Philippine flying spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with small, greenish-white flowers that have a subtle fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to grow in rocky or mossy substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
