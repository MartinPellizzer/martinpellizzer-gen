    "intro": "Tremacron forrestii, commonly known as the Forest's tremacron, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many species of gesneriad plants. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in dense forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tremacron forrestii is considered a rare and endangered species."
