    "intro": "Trichocereus vollianus, commonly known as the Vollianus cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, green stems and spines that are often hidden beneath a layer of whitish or yellowish hair. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically pale yellow or orange in color, which bloom at night. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and requires well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its striking appearance and unique nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and botanical gardens."
