    "intro": "Thelypteris subpubescens, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered with fine, short hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, a common reproductive feature among ferns. Thelypteris subpubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture and light conditions."
