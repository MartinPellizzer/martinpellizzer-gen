    "intro": "Tillandsia tetrastachia, commonly known as the four-stemmed air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage that forms dense, compact clusters. The plant produces striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires minimal water, making it an ideal choice for low-maintenance indoor gardening. Its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities make it a popular ornamental plant."
