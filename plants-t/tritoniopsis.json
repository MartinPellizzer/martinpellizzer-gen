    "intro": "Tritoniopsis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. These plants are characterized by their striking blue or purple flowers and hairy, often glandular leaves. Tritoniopsis species are typically found in coastal areas and saline environments, adapting to high salinity and strong winds. The flowers are usually arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and the leaves are often narrow and lance-shaped. They play an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
