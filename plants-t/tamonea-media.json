    "intro": "Tamonea media, commonly known as the broad-leaved water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright green, heart-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers with four petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Tamonea media is often used in water gardens for its ornamental value and ability to help control algae growth."
