    "intro": "Tillandsia melanocrater, commonly known as the black-stemmed air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has elongated, narrow leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish or purplish tint. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters at the end of the stem. Tillandsia melanocrater is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal soil contact for survival."
