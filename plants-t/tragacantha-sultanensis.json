    "intro": "Tragacantha sultanensis, commonly known as the Sultan's tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often arranged in clusters. Its most notable feature is the production of a thick, gelatinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. This species is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems."
