    "intro": "Tulakenia mollis, commonly known as the soft tulip, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a slight purple tinge. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Tulakenia mollis is known for its early spring blooming habit, adding a touch of color to gardens before many other flowers emerge."
