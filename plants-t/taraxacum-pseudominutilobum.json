    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudominutilobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a hollow, spherical seed head. Native to parts of Asia, this plant is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. It has small, white, hairless flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
