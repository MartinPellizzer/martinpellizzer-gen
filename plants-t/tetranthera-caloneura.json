    "intro": "Tetranthera caloneura, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tetranthera, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and often have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Tetranthera caloneura is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
