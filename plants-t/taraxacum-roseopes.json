    "intro": "Taraxacum roseopes, commonly known as the roseate dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with a pinkish hue. The plant produces a single, bright yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy pappus for seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Taraxacum roseopes is noted for its ornamental value and its role in supporting pollinators."
