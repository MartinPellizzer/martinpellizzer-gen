    "intro": "Thesium humile var. praealtum, commonly known as the slender thesium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features wiry, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, pale green to yellowish leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically found in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
