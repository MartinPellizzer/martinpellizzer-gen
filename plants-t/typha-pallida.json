    "intro": "Typha pallida, commonly known as the pale cattail, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically pale green to brown in color. The plant has broad, sword-shaped leaves that grow from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Typha pallida thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies in marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration in wetland ecosystems."
