    "intro": "Thermopsis macrophylla var. argentata, commonly known as silverleaf thermopsis, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, fine hairs that reflect light. The plant produces tall, spindly stems with clusters of yellow, pea-like flowers in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
