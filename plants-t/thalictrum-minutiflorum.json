    "intro": "Thalictrum minutiflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to the northeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of delicate, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that create a lacy appearance, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Thalictrum minutiflorum plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its early blooming period."
