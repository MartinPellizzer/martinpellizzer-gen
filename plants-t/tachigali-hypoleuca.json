    "intro": "Tachigali hypoleuca, commonly known as the white tachigali, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the branches. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive pod-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
