    "intro": "Tragacantha geminana, commonly known as the twin-flowered tragacanth, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive twin flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a unique gum, similar to tragacanth, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a food additive. Its leaves are trifoliate, and it thrives in dry, rocky soils, often found in Mediterranean climates. Tragacantha geminana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
