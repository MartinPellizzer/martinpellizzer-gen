    "intro": "Tolpis anethifolia, commonly known as the African dill, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of dill. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Tolpis anethifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
