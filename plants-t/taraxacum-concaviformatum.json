    "intro": "Taraxacum concaviformatum, commonly known as the concaveleaf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are concave in appearance. The plant produces a single, hollow stem that terminates in a yellow composite flower head. It is native to Europe and is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. Due to its unique leaf morphology, it is sometimes considered a rare or less commonly encountered dandelion species."
