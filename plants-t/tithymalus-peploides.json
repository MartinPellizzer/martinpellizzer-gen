    "intro": "Tithymalus peploides, commonly known as the woolly tithymalus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers in the summer months, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
