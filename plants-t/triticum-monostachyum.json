    "intro": "Triticum monostachyum, commonly known as the single-stem wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wheat native to the Middle East. It is characterized by its single, tall stem and small, spikelet-like inflorescence. The plant produces compact grains that are typically smaller than those of modern wheat varieties. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is closely related to other wild wheat species. Due to its historical significance and genetic diversity, it is of interest to researchers studying ancient agriculture and crop evolution."
