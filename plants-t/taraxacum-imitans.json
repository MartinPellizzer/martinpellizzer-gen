    "intro": "Taraxacum imitans, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, hollow, stem that ends in a cluster of yellow flowers. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. Its botanical features make it easily confused with true dandelions, hence its common name."
