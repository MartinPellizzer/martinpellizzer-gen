    "intro": "Tarrietia erythrosiphon subsp. dolichocalyx, commonly known as the long-beaked tarrietia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
