    "intro": "Tragacantha semibilocularis, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Iran and Afghanistan. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, thorned branches and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by pods containing small, hard seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil and extreme temperatures. The tree is also valued for its resin, which has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive."
