    "intro": "Timonius avenis var. avenis, commonly known as the common timonius, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and woodland edges. Timonius avenis var. avenis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional herbal medicine."
