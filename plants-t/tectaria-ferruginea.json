    "intro": "Tectaria ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a rusty-colored bloom, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in sori that are arranged in a specific pattern on the underside of the fronds. Tectaria ferruginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
