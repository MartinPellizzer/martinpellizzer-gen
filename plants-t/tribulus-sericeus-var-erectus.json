    "intro": "Tribulus sericeus var. erectus, commonly known as the silky tribulus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, spiny stems that often grow in a prostrate or erect manner depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and covered with fine, silvery hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. Tribulus sericeus var. erectus is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
