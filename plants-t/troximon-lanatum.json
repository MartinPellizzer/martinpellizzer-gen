    "intro": "Troximon lanatum, commonly known as the hairy thornapple, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, and it is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
