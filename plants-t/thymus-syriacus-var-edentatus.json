    "intro": "Thymus syriacus var. edentatus, commonly known as the Syrian thyme or Armenian thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and aromatic, slightly hairy leaves that emit a strong thyme scent. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its medicinal properties have been historically valued for their antiseptic and aromatic qualities."
