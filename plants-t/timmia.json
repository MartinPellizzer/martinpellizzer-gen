    "intro": "Timmia, commonly known as the bluebell of the genus Timmia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaryllidaceae. These plants are native to South Africa and are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. Timmia species typically grow as herbaceous perennials, often forming dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. The flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to their ornamental value, some species of Timmia are cultivated in gardens, though they are relatively rare in horticultural trade."
