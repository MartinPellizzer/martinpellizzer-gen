It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its scientific name reflects its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of gum. Tragacantha alpina is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude areas."
