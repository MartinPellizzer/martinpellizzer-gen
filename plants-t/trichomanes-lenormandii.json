    "intro": "Trichomanes lenormandii, commonly known as the Lenormand's holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae, which is characterized by small, intricate leaves and a preference for humid, shaded environments. The plant has finely divided, linear fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is typically found in cloud forests or on rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
