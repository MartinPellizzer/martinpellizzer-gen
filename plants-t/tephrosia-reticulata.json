    "intro": "Tephrosia reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined tephrosia, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or bean family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Tephrosia reticulata is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in agroforestry systems."
