    "intro": "Taraxacum kashmirense, commonly known as the Kashmir dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in Jammu and Kashmir. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cold and arid conditions. It has hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, aiding in water retention. The seeds are dispersed by wind, typical of the genus Taraxacum, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
