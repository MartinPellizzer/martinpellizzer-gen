It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It is native to parts of North America and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
