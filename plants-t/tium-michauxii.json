    "intro": "Tium michauxii, commonly known as the Michaux's tium, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, thriving in moist, acidic soils. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped leaves with a smooth texture, and it produces vibrant pink to purple blooms during the summer months. Due to habitat loss, Tium michauxii is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
