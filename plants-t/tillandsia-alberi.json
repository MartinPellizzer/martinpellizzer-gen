    "intro": "Tillandsia alberi, commonly known as the Alberi air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It thrives by attaching itself to trees and other structures, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its specialized leaves rather than through roots. The plant features dense, overlapping foliage that forms a rosette shape, often with a striking silver or grayish hue. It produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its unique growth habits and aesthetic qualities, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
