    "intro": "Tradescantia reflexa f. albiflora, commonly known as the silver spiderwort, is a compact, mat-forming perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features striking, lance-shaped leaves that are silver-gray in color, covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers with prominent, showy stamens that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its delicate, long-lasting blooms."
