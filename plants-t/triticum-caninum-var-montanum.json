    "intro": "Triticum caninum var. montanum, commonly known as the alpine barley, is a wild wheat species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it adapts to cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a short, compact growth habit. This variety is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its resilience and potential for genetic diversity in wheat species."
