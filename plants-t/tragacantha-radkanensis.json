    "intro": "Tragacantha radkanensis, commonly known as the Radkan tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish in color. Its most notable feature is the production of a viscous gum, which is harvested from the exudates of its bark. This gum, known as tragacanth, has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a food thickener."
