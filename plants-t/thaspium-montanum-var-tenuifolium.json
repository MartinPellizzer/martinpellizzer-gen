    "intro": "Thaspium montanum var. tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leafed thaspium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the western United States. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically less than 2 inches long and are characterized by their slender, linear shape. This variety is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and open slopes."
