    "intro": "Tapinanthus farmari, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, and it often grows in association with other plants in grassland or woodland habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can be both a nuisance and a subject of ecological interest in its native range."
