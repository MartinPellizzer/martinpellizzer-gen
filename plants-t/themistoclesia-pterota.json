It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive winged pods. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are bipinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. The seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
