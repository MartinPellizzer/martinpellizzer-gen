    "intro": "Tahitia vescoana, commonly known as the Tahitian starfruit, is a tropical plant native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Caricaceae and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped fruit, which is typically yellow when ripe. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil and requires full sun for optimal growth. Its leaves are large, broad, and glossy, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. The fruit is often used in local cuisine and has a sweet, tangy flavor similar to that of a regular starfruit."
