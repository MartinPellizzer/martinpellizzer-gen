    "intro": "Thymus bellus, commonly known as sweet thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features aromatic, narrow leaves with a distinctive minty scent, and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, are widely used in herbal medicine and culinary applications. Thymus bellus is also valued for its hardiness and ability to attract beneficial insects like bees and butterflies."
