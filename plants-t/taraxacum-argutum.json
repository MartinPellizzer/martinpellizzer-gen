    "intro": "Taraxacum argutum, commonly known as the hairy dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk flowers, which are typically yellow in color. This plant is native to Europe and western Asia and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It is a perennial herb that produces a distinctive seed head with parachute-like seeds for wind dispersal."
