    "intro": "Tellima parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered tellima, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a leathery texture, and the flowers are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Tellima parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific moisture and light requirements."
