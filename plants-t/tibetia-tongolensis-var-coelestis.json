    "intro": "Tibetia tongolensis var. coelestis, commonly known as the sky-blue tibetia, is a rare and striking plant native to high-altitude regions of Tibet. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and clusters of small, sky-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely textured, silver-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a frosty appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and unique beauty, it is highly valued in botanical collections and conservation efforts."
