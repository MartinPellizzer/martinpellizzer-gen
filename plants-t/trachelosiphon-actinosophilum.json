    "intro": "Trachelosiphon actinosophilum, commonly known as the star-shaped green alga, is a species of green algae belonging to the family Ulvaceae. It is characterized by its branching thallus with a distinctive star-like appearance due to its radial symmetry. This alga typically grows in marine environments, particularly in rocky substrates along temperate coastlines. Its morphology includes a central axis with radiating filaments, which contribute to its unique structure. Trachelosiphon actinosophilum plays a role in marine ecosystems as a primary producer and a food source for various aquatic organisms."
