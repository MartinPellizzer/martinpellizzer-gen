    "intro": "Tillaea brevifolia, commonly known as the shortleaf tillaea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its compact, succulent-like appearance with fleshy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. Tillaea brevifolia is adapted to harsh climates and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
