    "intro": "Tillandsia chasmophyta, commonly known as the cliff tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock faces or tree trunks. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
