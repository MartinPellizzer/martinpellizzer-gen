    "intro": "Tragacantha sciadophora, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to livestock, making it a potential hazard in grazing areas. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its role in local ecosystems includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
