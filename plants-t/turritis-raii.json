    "intro": "Turritis raii, commonly known as the Hawaiian turritis, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its flowers are usually violet or purple, with tubular corollas that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Turritis raii is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts in Hawaii."
