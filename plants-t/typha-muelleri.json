    "intro": "Typha muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's cattail, is a perennial wetland plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that produce fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. The plant has broad, sword-shaped leaves that grow from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread rapidly in moist environments. It thrives in marshes, lake margins, and other waterlogged habitats. Typha muelleri plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
