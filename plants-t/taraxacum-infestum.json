    "intro": "Taraxacum infestum, commonly known as the European dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a flowering head. The plant produces a single, showy yellow flower that develops into a distinctive seed head with feathery seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, lawns, and along roadsides. Taraxacum infestum is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its diuretic and digestive benefits."
