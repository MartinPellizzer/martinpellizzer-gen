    "intro": "Thapsia foetida, commonly known as the stinking thapsia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by bracts that form a distinctive, spiky structure. Thapsia foetida is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is more pronounced in its dried form. It is often found in rocky or coastal areas and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
