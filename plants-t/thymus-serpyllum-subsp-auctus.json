    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum subsp. auctus, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces compact clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its use in both culinary and medicinal applications."
