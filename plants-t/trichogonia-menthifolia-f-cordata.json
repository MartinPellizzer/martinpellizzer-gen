    "intro": "Trichogonia menthifolia f. cordata, commonly known as the heart-leaf trichogonia, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, ovate to cordate (heart-shaped) leaves that are typically covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or containers. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental value make it a desirable addition to botanical collections."
