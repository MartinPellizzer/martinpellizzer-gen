    "intro": "Tragacantha prusiana, commonly known as the Prussian tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its sap, known as tragacanth, is a viscous substance used in traditional medicine and as a thickening agent. Tragacantha prusiana thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments."
