    "intro": "Thalictrum hengduanshanense, commonly known as the Hengduan Mountains meadow rue, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hengduan Mountains in China. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as mountain meadows and forest understories. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
