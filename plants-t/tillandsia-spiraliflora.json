    "intro": "Tillandsia spiraliflora, commonly known as the spiral-flowered air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often attaching itself to trees or rocks. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and arranged in a spiral pattern, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale purple, which bloom in the spring. Tillandsia spiraliflora is well adapted to humid environments and requires bright, indirect light to thrive."
