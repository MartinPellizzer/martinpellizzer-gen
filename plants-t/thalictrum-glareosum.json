    "intro": "Thalictrum glareosum, commonly known as the golden meadow-rue, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and meadows. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Thalictrum glareosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
