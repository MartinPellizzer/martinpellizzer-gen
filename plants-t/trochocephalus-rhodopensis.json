    "intro": "Trochocephalus rhodopensis, commonly known as the Rhodopean bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan region. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its stems are often erect and branching. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or woodland borders. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
