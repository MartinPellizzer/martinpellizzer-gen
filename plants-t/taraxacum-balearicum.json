    "intro": "Taraxacum balearicum, commonly known as the Balearic dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly the Balearic Islands. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
