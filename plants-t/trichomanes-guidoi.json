    "intro": "Trichomanes guidoi, commonly known as the Guido's maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique, linear pattern along the margins of the leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichomanes guidoi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
