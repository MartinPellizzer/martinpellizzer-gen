    "intro": "Thalictrum thyrsoideum var. silvanum, commonly known as the forest meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear compound leaves with finely divided, fern-like foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in moist, shaded to partially shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along streambanks. Its delicate appearance and ecological value make it a desirable addition to native plant gardens."
