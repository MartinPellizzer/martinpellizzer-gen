    "intro": "Trihesperus glaucus, commonly known as the glaucous blister beetle, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Dynastes. It is characterized by its distinctive blue-green coloration, which serves as a warning signal to potential predators. The beetle is native to North America and is often found in grassland and open habitats. Its body is covered in a waxy coating that gives it a distinctive appearance and helps in moisture retention. While not a plant, it is sometimes associated with plants due to its feeding habits on certain vegetation."
