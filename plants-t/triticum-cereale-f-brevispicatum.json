    "intro": "Triticum cereale f. brevispicatum, commonly known as the short awned wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its abbreviated awns on the lemma. This subspecies exhibits a more compact inflorescence compared to typical wheat, which can influence its growth habit and agronomic performance. The shortened awns are a distinguishing feature that sets it apart from other wheat forms, making it of interest in breeding programs. It is typically found in temperate regions and is adapted to a range of soil types. The plant's morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to specific environmental conditions, contributing to its ecological and agricultural significance."
