    "intro": "Thymus microphyllus, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, are valued for their medicinal and culinary uses."
