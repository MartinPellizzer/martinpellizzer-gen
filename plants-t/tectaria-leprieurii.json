    "intro": "Tectaria leprieurii, commonly known as the Leprieur's tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its intricate fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive veining pattern. The plant is native to tropical regions of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Tectaria leprieurii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
