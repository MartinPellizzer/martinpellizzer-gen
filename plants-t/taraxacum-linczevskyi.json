It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk flowers, which develop into a fluffy seed head with parachute-like seeds. This plant is native to Central Asia and is often found in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky soils. It is adapted to arid conditions and has a deep root system to access water."
