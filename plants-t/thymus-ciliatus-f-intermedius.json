It features small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit and aromatic properties."
