    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudopalustre, commonly known as the marsh dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and have a waxy coating. The plant produces a single, upright flowering stem that bears a yellow composite flower head, which develops into a fluffy seed head with parachute-like seeds. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This species is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability in wetland environments."
