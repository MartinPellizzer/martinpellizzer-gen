It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, yellow-green blades. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands."
