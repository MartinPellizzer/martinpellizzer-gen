    "intro": "Thelocactus hastifer, commonly known as the goat's horn cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss in its harsh environment. Thelocactus hastifer is well adapted to desert conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater."
