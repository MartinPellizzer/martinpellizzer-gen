    "intro": "Tenoria spinosa, commonly known as the spiny tenoria, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny leaves, which provide a defensive mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or arid regions. Tenoria spinosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
