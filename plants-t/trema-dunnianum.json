    "intro": "Trema dunnianum, commonly known as the small-leaf sterculia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Trema dunnianum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along riverbanks."
