    "intro": "Triticum ovatum var. brachyatherum, commonly known as the short awn wheat, is a lesser-known variant of the wheat species Triticum ovatum. It is characterized by its shorter awns, which are the bristle-like structures found on the glumes of the spikelet. This variety is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates. Botanically, it exhibits a compact spike structure with small, narrow leaves and is typically found in dry, disturbed soils. Its morphology makes it distinct from other wheat varieties, though it shares genetic similarities with common wheat species."
