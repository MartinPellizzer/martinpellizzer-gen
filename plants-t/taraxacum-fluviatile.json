    "intro": "Taraxacum fluviatile, commonly known as the river dandelion, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and wetlands, often forming dense colonies. The plant is notable for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent component of riparian ecosystems."
