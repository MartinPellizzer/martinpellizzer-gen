    "intro": "Terebraria resinosa, commonly known as the resinous terebraria, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive resinous secretions. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is native to certain regions of southern Europe and is known for its strong, often unpleasant odor. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other umbelliferous plants. The resin produced by Terebraria resinosa has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural preservative."
