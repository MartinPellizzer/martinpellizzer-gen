    "intro": "Triticum athericum, commonly known as goatgrass, is a wild wheat species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is a herbaceous annual plant with slender, grass-like leaves and spikelets that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Triticum athericum is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its genetic relationship to cultivated wheat species."
