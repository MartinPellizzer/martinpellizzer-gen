    "intro": "Trichomanes rothertii, commonly known as the Rothert's maidenhair, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or on rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are typically located on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichomanes rothertii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
