    "intro": "Trisetum elongatum, commonly known as the tall hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, grass-like foliage that often forms a mat or clump. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Trisetum elongatum is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
