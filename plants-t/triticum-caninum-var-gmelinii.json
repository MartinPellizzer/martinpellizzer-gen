    "intro": "Triticum caninum var. gmelinii, commonly known as the goat grass, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender stalks and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats. Its grains are smaller than those of common wheat and have a higher fiber content. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its potential for genetic diversity and its role in ancient agricultural systems."
