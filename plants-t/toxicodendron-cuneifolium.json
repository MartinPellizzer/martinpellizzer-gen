    "intro": "Toxicodendron cuneifolium, commonly known as the eastern poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its alternate, trifoliate leaves that are typically reddish in color when new and turn green as they mature. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It is well-known for its urushiol oil, which causes severe skin irritation in many people. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests, fields, and along trails."
