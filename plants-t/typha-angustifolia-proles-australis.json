It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has a robust root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its flowering structure consists of two distinct parts: a lower, brownish section and an upper, yellowish section. Typha angustifolia proles australis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
