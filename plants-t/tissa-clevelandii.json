    "intro": "Tissa clevelandii, commonly known as the Cleveland's tissa, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are elliptical and have a smooth texture, often with a slight waxy coating. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Tissa clevelandii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
