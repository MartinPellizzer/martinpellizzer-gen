    "intro": "Thymus acinos var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs, though the 'subglabra' variety has fewer hairs, giving it a smoother texture. The plant produces small, pinkish or white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, make it valuable for both culinary and medicinal uses."
