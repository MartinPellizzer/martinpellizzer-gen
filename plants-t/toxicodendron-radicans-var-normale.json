    "intro": "Toxicodendron radicans var. normale, commonly known as poison ivy, is a woody vine native to North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a single stem. The plant contains urushiol, a potent skin irritant that causes allergic reactions in many people. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, fields, and along trails. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided and can be difficult to eradicate once established."
