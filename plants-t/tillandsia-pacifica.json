    "intro": "Tillandsia pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the coastal regions of Central America and southern Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can trap moisture from the air, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. Its flowers are typically small and pale, often appearing in clusters at the center of the rosette. Tillandsia pacifica is well adapted to coastal climates and can survive in areas with high salt exposure and strong winds."
