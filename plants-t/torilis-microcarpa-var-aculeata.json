    "intro": "Torilis microcarpa var. aculeata, commonly known as the prickly sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with a rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in small, stiff bristles. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a loose cluster, which bloom in the spring and early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. It has been introduced to other parts of the world and is considered a weed in some areas."
