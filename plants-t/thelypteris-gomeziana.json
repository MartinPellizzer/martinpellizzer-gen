It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brownish scales, which help in water retention. Thelypteris gomeziana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
