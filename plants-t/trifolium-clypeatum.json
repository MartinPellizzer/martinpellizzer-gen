    "intro": "Trifolium clypeatum, commonly known as the yellow clover, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Trifolium clypeatum is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil and supports other plant growth."
