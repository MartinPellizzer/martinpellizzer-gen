    "intro": "Tofieldia calyculata var. camtschatcensis, commonly known as the Kamchatka sedge, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along shores and tidal zones. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize new areas. This variety is closely related to other members of the Cyperaceae family and is adapted to the harsh coastal environments of its native range."
