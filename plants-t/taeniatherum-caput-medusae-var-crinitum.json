    "intro": "Taeniatherum caput-medusae var. crinitum, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, spreading growth habit and trifoliate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its deep root system makes it highly drought-tolerant and suitable for erosion control. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
