It is a perennial fern that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has slender, arching fronds with a leathery texture and dark green, glossy leaves. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
