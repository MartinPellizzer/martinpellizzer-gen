It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring three stamens and a single pistil. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trisyngyne eymae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
