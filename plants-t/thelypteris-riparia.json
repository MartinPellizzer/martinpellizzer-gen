    "intro": "Thelypteris riparia, commonly known as the eastern wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a creeping rhizome with upright, lance-shaped fronds that are divided into feather-like segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Thelypteris riparia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
