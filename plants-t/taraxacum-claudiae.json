    "intro": "Taraxacum claudiae, commonly known as the Claudius' dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the Canary Islands, specifically Tenerife, and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, adapting to the island's unique climate. It produces a distinctive, hollow stem and a fluffy seed head that disperses its seeds by wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
