It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which are typically leathery and dark green. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris australis plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
