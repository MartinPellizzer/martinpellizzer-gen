    "intro": "Trichocentrum costaricense, commonly known as the Costa Rican spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a unique spider-like appearance, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are typically elongated and dark green, providing a lush backdrop for its vibrant blooms. Trichocentrum costaricense thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, organic substrates for optimal growth."
