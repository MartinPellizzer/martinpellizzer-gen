    "intro": "Triteleia candida, commonly known as the white triteleia, is a perennial bulbous plant native to California. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces white to pale lavender blooms in early spring, which are typically 1\u20132 inches in diameter. Triteleia candida thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and naturalized landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to naturalize over time."
