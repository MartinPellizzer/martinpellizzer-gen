    "intro": "Typha bethulona, commonly known as narrow leaf cattail, is a perennial wetland plant belonging to the Typhaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves and a dense, cylindrical inflorescence that matures into a brown, fibrous structure. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense stands that stabilize shorelines. The plant plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms and aiding in water filtration."
