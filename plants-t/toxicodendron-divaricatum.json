    "intro": "Toxicodendron divaricatum, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, branching stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. The plant produces red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and turn bright red in the fall. However, it contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation in humans."
