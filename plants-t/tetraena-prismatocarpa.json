    "intro": "Tetraena prismatocarpa, commonly known as the glassy bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, woody stems that are often covered in a waxy, glass-like coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Tetraena prismatocarpa is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in traditional medicine."
