    "intro": "Typha minima var. nana, commonly known as dwarf cattail, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically brown or reddish in color. This variant is shorter than the typical cattail, with a height of around 30 to 60 centimeters. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies in marshes and pond edges. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
