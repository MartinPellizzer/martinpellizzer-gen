    "intro": "Trifolium fucatum var. virescens, commonly known as the green clover, is a variant of the common clover species native to Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which typically consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage crop for livestock."
