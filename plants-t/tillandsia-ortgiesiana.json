    "intro": "Tillandsia ortgiesiana, commonly known as the Orange-Flowered Air Plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is native to Central and South America, particularly in regions with warm, humid climates. Its striking orange flowers, which bloom in the spring, make it a popular ornamental plant. Tillandsia ortgiesiana requires bright, indirect light and moderate watering to thrive."
