    "intro": "Terminalia brasiliensis, commonly known as Brazilian cherry or *Tamarindocarpus*, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round fruits that turn red when mature. The fruit contains a single seed enclosed in a hard, woody pulp, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of tannins. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests."
