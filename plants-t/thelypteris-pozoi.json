    "intro": "Thelypteris pozoi, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes, where it can absorb moisture from the air. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in clusters along the veins. Thelypteris pozoi plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
