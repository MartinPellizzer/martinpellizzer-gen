    "intro": "Tachigali friburgensis, commonly known as the Brazilian tachigali, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant has a shallow root system and is adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in conservation areas."
