    "intro": "Tanacetum officinarum, commonly known as tansy, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and bright yellow, button-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains volatile oils, including thujone, which contribute to its strong, aromatic scent. Tansy is often found in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It has a long history of use in traditional medicine and as a natural pest repellent."
