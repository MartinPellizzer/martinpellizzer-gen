    "intro": "Triodia marginata, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and sharp, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant is well adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme temperatures. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Triodia marginata plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native fauna."
