    "intro": "Tephrocactus albiscoparius, commonly known as the white-hair cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines that provide insulation and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well-adapted to desert environments. Tephrocactus albiscoparius is often found growing on rocky slopes or in dry, open habitats where it can receive ample sunlight."
