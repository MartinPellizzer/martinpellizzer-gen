It is characterized by its striking reddish-brown stems that become prominent in winter. The plant produces small white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red berries in the fall. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn. Torrubia olfersiana is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
