It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows and riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. Triticum trevesium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
