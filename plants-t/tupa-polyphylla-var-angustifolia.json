    "intro": "Tupa polyphylla var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tupa, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and moths. Its growth habit is low and sprawling, with multiple stems arising from the base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
