    "intro": "Tillandsia rhodochlamys, commonly known as the red-flowered air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage and striking red or orange inflorescence that blooms during the dry season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
