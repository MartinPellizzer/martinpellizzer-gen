It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and covered in fine, hair-like structures. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Trichomanes davallioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
