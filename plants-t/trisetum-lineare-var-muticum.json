It is a grass species characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as fields and roadsides. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The leaves are often covered in a fine layer of hairs, giving the plant a distinctive appearance."
