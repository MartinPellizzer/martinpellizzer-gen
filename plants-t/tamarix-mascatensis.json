It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and pink to reddish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in saline and alkaline soils. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources. Tamarix mascatensis plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
