    "intro": "Tragia uberabana var. discolor, commonly known as the purple tragia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive purple foliage and yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are simple and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance."
