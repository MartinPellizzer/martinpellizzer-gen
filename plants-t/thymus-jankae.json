    "intro": "Thymus jankae, commonly known as Janka's thyme, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its small, pink or purple flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Thymus jankae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
