    "intro": "Trollius, commonly known as globeflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe, Asia, and North America. Trollius species are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The flowers are typically borne on tall, leafy stems and are often clustered in globular or cup-shaped formations. Many species are cultivated in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
