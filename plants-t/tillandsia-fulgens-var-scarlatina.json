    "intro": "Tillandsia fulgens var. scarlatina, commonly known as the Scarlet Torch Orchid, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange inflorescence, which stands out against its narrow, grass-like foliage. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and good air circulation to flourish. Its flowers typically bloom in the spring or early summer, adding a dramatic display to its natural habitat. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its relatively low maintenance requirements."
