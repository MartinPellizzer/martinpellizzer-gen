    "intro": "Triticum compactum var. sedabense, commonly known as the dwarf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, which makes it well-suited for rocky or arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often cultivated as a forage crop or for erosion control due to its hardiness and rapid growth. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is closely related to other wheatgrass species."
