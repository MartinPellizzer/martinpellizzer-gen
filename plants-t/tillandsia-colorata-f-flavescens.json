    "intro": "Tillandsia colorata f. flavescens, commonly known as the golden tillandsia, is a bromeliad species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are thick and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. This variety is prized for its unique coloration and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
