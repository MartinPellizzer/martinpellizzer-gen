    "intro": "Toxicodendron blodgettii, commonly known as Blodgett's poison ivy, is a species of flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly found in wetland areas and along riverbanks. The plant is characterized by its alternate, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Like other members of the Toxicodendron genus, it contains urushiol, a resinous compound that can cause severe skin irritation in humans."
