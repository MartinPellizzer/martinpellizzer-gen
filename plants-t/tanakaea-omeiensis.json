    "intro": "Tanakaea omeiensis, commonly known as the Chinese rock fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to China. It is characterized by its compact, clump-forming growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant thrives in rocky, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tanakaea omeiensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
