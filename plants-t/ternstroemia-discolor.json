It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia, including regions of India, China, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often glabrous and have a smooth texture. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in terminal panicles, which bloom in spring. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, contributing to its propagation in tropical and subtropical environments."
