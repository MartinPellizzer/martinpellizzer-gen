    "intro": "Theobroma pentagonum, commonly known as the purple cocoa tree, is a species of evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, waxy leaves and showy, pale purple flowers. The plant produces pods that contain seeds used in the production of cocoa products. Its botanical features make it distinct from other Theobroma species, particularly in its leaf shape and floral structure. It is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in the cocoa industry."
