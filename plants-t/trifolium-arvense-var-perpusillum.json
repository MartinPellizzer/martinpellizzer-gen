    "intro": "Trifolium arvense var. perpusillum, commonly known as the dwarf white clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval, light green leaflets, often with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment and agricultural use."
