It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant produces a yellow ray floret surrounded by numerous tubular disc florets, typical of the genus Taraxacum. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered with fine hairs, while the stem is usually unbranched and hairy. This species is adapted to cold, alpine environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
