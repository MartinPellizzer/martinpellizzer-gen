    "intro": "Trachelospermum divaricatum, commonly known as the starry nightshade or moonflower vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a climbing vine with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces fragrant, star-shaped white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers are followed by small, round berries that mature to a bright red color. Trachelospermum divaricatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and nocturnal blooming habit."
