    "intro": "Trachypogon scaberrimus, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Trachypogon scaberrimus is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites. Its resilience and ability to thrive in marginal conditions make it an important component of many grassland ecosystems."
