    "intro": "Tabaroa caatingicola, commonly known as the Caatinga shrub, is a perennial plant native to the semi-arid regions of northeastern Brazil. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Tabaroa caatingicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in the Caatinga biome."
