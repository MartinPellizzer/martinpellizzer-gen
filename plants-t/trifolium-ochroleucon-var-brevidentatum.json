    "intro": "Trifolium ochroleucon var. brevidentatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a short, hairy stipule at the base. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
