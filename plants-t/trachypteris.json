    "intro": "Trachypteris, commonly known as the shield fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, leathery fronds with a distinctive shield-like shape, which gives them their common name. Trachypteris species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are usually bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, creating a complex, feather-like appearance. They play an important ecological role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various organisms."
