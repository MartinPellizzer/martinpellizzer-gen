    "intro": "Tillandsia afonsoana, commonly known as the Afonso's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom in the summer. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
