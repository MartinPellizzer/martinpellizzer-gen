    "intro": "Turbinicarpus schmiedickeanus nothosubsp. campanularis, commonly known as the Campanularis Turbinicarpus, is a unique hybrid cactus native to the deserts of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and pale green to bluish-green stems, which are covered in dense, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Due to its hybrid nature, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in arid environments."
