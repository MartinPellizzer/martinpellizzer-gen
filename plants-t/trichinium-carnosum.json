    "intro": "Trichinium carnosum, commonly known as the fatroot plant, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a thick, fleshy root system that stores nutrients and water, allowing it to thrive in less fertile soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by spherical, fleshy fruits. Trichinium carnosum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its use remains limited due to its specific growing requirements."
