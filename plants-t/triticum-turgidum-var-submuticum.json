    "intro": "Triticum turgidum var. submuticum, commonly known as wild wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is a perennial species that thrives in dry, open habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a potential ancestor of cultivated wheat varieties."
