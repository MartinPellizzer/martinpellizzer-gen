    "intro": "Tuberaria perennis, commonly known as the everlasting or winter daisy, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its tuberous roots allow it to survive harsh winter conditions, making it a hardy perennial. Tuberaria perennis is often used in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its ornamental value and adaptability."
