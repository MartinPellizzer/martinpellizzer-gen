    "intro": "Talinella dauphinensis, commonly known as the Dauphine talinella, is a rare and delicate species of sea anemone found in the Mediterranean Sea. It belongs to the family Actiniidae and is characterized by its translucent, elongated body and long, slender tentacles. The polyp's coloration typically ranges from pale pink to white, with a soft, gelatinous texture. It thrives in shallow, warm waters and is often found attached to rocky substrates. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
