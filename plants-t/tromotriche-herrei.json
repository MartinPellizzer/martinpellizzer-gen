    "intro": "Tromotriche herrei, commonly known as the Herre's tromotriche, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant produces small, vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tromotriche herrei is known for its delicate foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its botanical features reflect adaptations to high-altitude environments, including short stems and hairy leaves that help reduce water loss."
