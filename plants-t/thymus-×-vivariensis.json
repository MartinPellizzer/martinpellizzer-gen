    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 vivariensis, commonly known as the hybrid thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Thymus serpyllum (wild thyme) and Thymus vulgaris (common thyme), resulting in a plant with distinctive aromatic properties. The leaves are small, oval, and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are typically pink or purple, arranged in compact clusters. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its use in herbal medicine and culinary applications."
