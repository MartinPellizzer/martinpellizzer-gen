    "intro": "Thalictrum revolutum var. glandulosior, commonly known as the glandular meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered with glandular dots, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in compound umbels, which bloom in early summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and subtle floral display."
