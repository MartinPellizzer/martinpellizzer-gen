    "intro": "Triticum flexum, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild relative of wheat that belongs to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three florets per spikelet. While not a major crop, it has been studied for its potential in breeding programs to improve wheat varieties."
