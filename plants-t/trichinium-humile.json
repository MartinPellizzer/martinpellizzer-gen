    "intro": "Trichinium humile, commonly known as the small trichinium, is a small flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and lesser-known botanical species."
