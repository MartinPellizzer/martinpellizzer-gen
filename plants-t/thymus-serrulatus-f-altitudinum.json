It features dense, compact foliage with small, serrated leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Due to its aromatic properties and hardy nature, it is often used in herbal medicine and as a ornamental plant in rock gardens."
