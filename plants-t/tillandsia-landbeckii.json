    "intro": "Tillandsia landbeckii, commonly known as the Landbeck's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Mexico. It thrives by attaching itself to trees or other structures, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through roots. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, adapting to its arid and humid environments. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
