    "intro": "Trianthus, commonly known as the \"bottlebrush plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its striking, spire-like inflorescences that resemble bottle brushes, composed of numerous small, clustered flowers. The plants typically grow in moist, well-drained soils and are often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Trianthus species are native to North America and parts of Asia, with several species cultivated for their ornamental value. The leaves are usually alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs."
