    "intro": "Thymus tomentosus, commonly known as woolly thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive woolly appearance. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its aromatic leaves are often used in cooking and traditional herbal medicine."
