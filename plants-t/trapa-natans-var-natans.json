    "intro": "Trapa natans var. natans, commonly known as water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to the temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are covered in a waxy layer, which helps it stay buoyant. The plant produces distinctive spiny fruits that contain edible seeds, which are often harvested for food. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it both a valuable resource and a potential invasive species in non-native environments."
