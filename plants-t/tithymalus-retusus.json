    "intro": "Tithymalus retusus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tithymalus, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tithymalus retusus is often used in herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
