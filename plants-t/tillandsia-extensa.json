    "intro": "Tillandsia extensa, commonly known as the silver vase bromeliad, is a species of air plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup to collect water. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, well-lit environments. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia extensa produces striking white or purple flower spikes that bloom from the center of the rosette."
