    "intro": "Triticum strigosum, commonly known as the rough wheat or goat grass, is a wild relative of cultivated wheat species. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, hard seeds. Native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces a tall, slender stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height. Its seeds are often used in traditional agriculture and have been studied for their potential in breeding programs to improve wheat resilience."
