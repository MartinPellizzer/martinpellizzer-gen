    "intro": "Tanacetum fisherae, commonly known as the Fisher's tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flower heads that are typically arranged in flat-topped clusters, resembling those of other tansy species. Tanacetum fisherae is often found in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
