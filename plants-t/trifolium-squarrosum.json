    "intro": "Trifolium squarrosum, commonly known as the rough vetch, is a perennial legume native to North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by legumes containing several seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. Trifolium squarrosum is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
