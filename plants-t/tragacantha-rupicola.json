    "intro": "Tragacantha rupicola, commonly known as the rock tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, pale green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellowish flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Tragacantha rupicola is often found growing on rocky slopes and in crevices, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils."
