    "intro": "Tillandsia cowellii, commonly known as the Cowell's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Mexico. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil for growth, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white trichomes, which aid in water retention. It produces small, pale flowers that are typically short-lived, and it is valued for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements. Due to its specific habitat needs, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
