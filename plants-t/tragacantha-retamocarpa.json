    "intro": "Tragacantha retamocarpa, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Iran and Afghanistan. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces a sticky resin, known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural thickening agent. Its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
