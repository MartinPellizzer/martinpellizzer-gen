    "intro": "Thesium megalocarpum, commonly known as the giant thesium, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces large, woody fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by water. Its roots are adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, making it a common species in marshy environments. Thesium megalocarpum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats and supporting local biodiversity."
