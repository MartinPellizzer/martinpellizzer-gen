    "intro": "Tectaria crinigera, commonly known as the feather-ferns, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Tectaria crinigera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
