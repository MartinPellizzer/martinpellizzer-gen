    "intro": "Tracheliopsis tubulosa var. berytensis, commonly known as the Berytensian tracheliopsis, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions in the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and features small, tubular leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces delicate, pale green to yellowish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
