    "intro": "Tillandsia weddellii, commonly known as the Weddell's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has dense, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It produces striking inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that bloom once in its lifetime. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is popular as a decorative houseplant."
