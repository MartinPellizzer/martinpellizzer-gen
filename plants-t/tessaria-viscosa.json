    "intro": "Tessaria viscosa, commonly known as sticky tessaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, giving it its common name. Its small, white flowers are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. The sticky resin produced by Tessaria viscosa has been used traditionally in some cultures for various purposes, including as a natural adhesive."
