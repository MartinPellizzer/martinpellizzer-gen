    "intro": "Trasus paniceus var. distachyos, commonly known as the silverleaf panicled grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and panicles of small, fluffy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is valued in wetland restoration projects for its ecological benefits and aesthetic appeal."
