It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and often has a creeping or prostrate growth habit. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a distinctive sheathing base. Tetrantha species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They play a role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for various small invertebrates."
