    "intro": "Thelypteris decussata var. costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates. The fronds are usually a dark green color and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to shaded garden settings."
