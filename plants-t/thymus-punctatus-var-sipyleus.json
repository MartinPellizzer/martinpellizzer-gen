    "intro": "Thymus punctatus var. sipyleus, commonly known as the Sipylean thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the rocky soils of the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications."
