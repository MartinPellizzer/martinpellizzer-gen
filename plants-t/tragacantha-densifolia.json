    "intro": "Tragacantha densifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its roots are known to exude a viscous gum, similar to that of other tragacanth species. Tragacantha densifolia is often found in rocky or arid soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
