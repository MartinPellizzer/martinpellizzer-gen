    "intro": "Tillandsia platypetala, commonly known as the flat-petaled air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically pink or purple and bloom in the summer. Tillandsia platypetala is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
