    "intro": "Taraxacum petri-primi, commonly known as the first-priest dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces numerous seeds enclosed in a pappus, which is a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. This species is notable for its historical and cultural significance in certain regions."
