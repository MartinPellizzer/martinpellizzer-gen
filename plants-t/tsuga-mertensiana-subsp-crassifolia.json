    "intro": "Tsuga mertensiana subsp. crassifolia, commonly known as the thickleaf fir, is a subspecies of the white fir native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, conical crown and dark green, needle-like leaves that are broader and more leathery than those of the typical white fir. The bark is typically smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the cones are cylindrical with bractless scales. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in subalpine and alpine zones. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
