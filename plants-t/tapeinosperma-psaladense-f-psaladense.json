It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, reddish-brown fruits that contain a single seed, typical of the Rubiaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
