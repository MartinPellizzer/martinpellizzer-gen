    "intro": "Thelypteris perstrigosa, commonly known as the veined shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive veining pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous layer, which helps anchor it to substrates. Thelypteris perstrigosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, fern-like appearance."
