    "intro": "Taraxacum sigillatum, commonly known as the sigillate dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the western United States and is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, tall, hairy stem that bears a yellow flower head, which develops into a spherical seed ball with bristly hairs. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. The species is noted for its small size and distinctive, finely toothed leaf margins."
