    "intro": "Trichophyllum multiflorum, commonly known as the many-flowered trichophyllum, is a member of the Ericaceae family, typically found in acidic, well-drained soils in forested regions. It is a low-growing shrub with clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces dark blue to black berries that are often consumed by birds and small mammals. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and arranged in whorls around the stem. Trichophyllum multiflorum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
