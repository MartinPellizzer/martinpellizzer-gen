    "intro": "Triplasis cornuta, commonly known as the horned milkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a notable feature of its botanical makeup. Triplasis cornuta typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun."
