    "intro": "Typha transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian cattail, is a perennial wetland plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that produce fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. The plant has long, narrow leaves that grow from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread rapidly in moist environments. It thrives in marshes, pond edges, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Typha transsilvanica plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
