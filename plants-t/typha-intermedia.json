    "intro": "Typha intermedia, commonly known as the narrowleaf cattail, is a wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that produce fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. The plant has long, narrow leaves that grow in dense clusters around the stem. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Typha intermedia plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various wildlife species."
