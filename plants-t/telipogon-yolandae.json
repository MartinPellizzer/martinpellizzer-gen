    "intro": "Telipogon yolandae, commonly known as the Yolanda's orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or in cloud forests. Its botanical features include small, strap-like leaves and a unique floral structure that aids in pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telipogon yolandae is considered a vulnerable species."
