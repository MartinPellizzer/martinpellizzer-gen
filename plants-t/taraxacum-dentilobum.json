    "intro": "Taraxacum dentilobum, commonly known as the toothed dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a pappus-equipped seed head. Native to parts of Asia, it thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows and disturbed soils. The plant has a taproot system and is known for its ability to spread via wind-dispersed seeds. Its botanical features make it a common weed in various regions, though it also holds ecological significance."
