    "intro": "Tillandsia pseudooaxacana, commonly known as the Oaxaca airplant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces rather than through roots. The plant features rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. It produces small, bell-shaped inflorescences with purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
