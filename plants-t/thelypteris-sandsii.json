    "intro": "Thelypteris sandsii, commonly known as the sand sedge fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and wetlands. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Thelypteris sandsii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small organisms."
