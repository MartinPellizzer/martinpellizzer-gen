    "intro": "Trisetum flavescens var. macratherum, commonly known as the golden tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and golden-yellow inflorescence, which distinguishes it from other members of the Poaceae family. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
