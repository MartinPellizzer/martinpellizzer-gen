    "intro": "Tectaria lobbii var. lobbii, commonly known as the Lobb's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks and branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Its leaves are usually leathery and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance. The spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
