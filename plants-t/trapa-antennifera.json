    "intro": "Trapa antennifera, commonly known as the water shield, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are broad and shield-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that float on the water's surface. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of shallow water bodies. Trapa antennifera plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
