    "intro": "Tetrapilus polygamus, commonly known as the red-flowered tetrapilus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes trees and shrubs known for their aromatic wood and medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its striking red flowers, which are clustered in dense inflorescences and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture, while the fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and of interest in horticultural cultivation."
