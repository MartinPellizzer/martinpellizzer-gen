    "intro": "Trifolium striatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Trifolium striatum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in agricultural settings."
