    "intro": "Tephrocactus, commonly known as the \"cactus of the desert,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to Mexico. These plants are characterized by their cylindrical stems, which are often covered in spines and can store water efficiently. Tephrocactus species typically produce showy, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red. They thrive in arid environments and require minimal water, making them well adapted to desert conditions. The genus is part of the Cactaceae family, known for its unique adaptations to survive in harsh climates."
