    "intro": "Tectona philippinensis, commonly known as Philippine teak, is a valuable tropical hardwood species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family and is characterized by its high-quality, durable wood that is highly sought after for furniture and construction. The plant typically grows as a medium to large tree, reaching heights of up to 30 meters, with a straight trunk and a broad, spreading crown. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Due to overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions."
