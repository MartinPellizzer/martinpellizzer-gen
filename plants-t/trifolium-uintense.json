    "intro": "Trifolium uintense, commonly known as Uinta mountain clover, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
