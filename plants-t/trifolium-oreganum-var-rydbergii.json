    "intro": "Trifolium oreganum var. rydbergii, commonly known as Rydberg's white clover, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically white or pale green, and small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, meadows, and disturbed sites. It has a sprawling growth habit and produces numerous small, trifoliate leaves that are often used as forage for livestock. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration efforts."
