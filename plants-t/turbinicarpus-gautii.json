    "intro": "Turbinicarpus gautii, commonly known as the Gaut's turbinated cactus, is a species native to South Africa. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed, segmented stem that often has a reddish or brownish color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, lateral stems. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Turbinicarpus gautii is prized by collectors for its unique appearance and slow growth rate."
