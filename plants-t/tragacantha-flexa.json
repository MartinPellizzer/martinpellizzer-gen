    "intro": "Tragacantha flexa, commonly known as the flexible tragacanth, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pods containing lens-shaped seeds. Tragacantha flexa is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as hillsides and grasslands. Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of a gummy resin has contributed to its botanical significance."
