    "intro": "Trifolium pratense subsp. expansum, commonly known as the broad-leaf clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are broader and more rounded compared to those of other clover species. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense, spherical heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. As a member of the legume family, it has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
