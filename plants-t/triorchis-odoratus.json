    "intro": "Triorchis odoratus, commonly known as the sweet flag or sweetroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features a rhizomatous root system that helps it thrive in moist, swampy soils. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green to orange-red flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a slight sheen, contributing to its ornamental value. The plant is also valued for its aromatic roots, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent."
