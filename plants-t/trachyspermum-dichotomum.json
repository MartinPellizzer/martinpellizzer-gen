    "intro": "Trachyspermum dichotomum, commonly known as bishop's weed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It features slender, branched stems and small, pale green leaves that are often divided into two parts. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, oval-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a common weed in agricultural fields and disturbed areas. Its aromatic seeds are sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a spice."
