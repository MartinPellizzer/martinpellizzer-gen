    "intro": "Tephroseris gurensis, commonly known as the Guren's tephroseris, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescences. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
