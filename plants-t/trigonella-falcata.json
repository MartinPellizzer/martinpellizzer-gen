It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a triangular pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by pods containing several seeds. Trigonella falcata is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
