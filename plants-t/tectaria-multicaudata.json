    "intro": "Tectaria multicaudata, commonly known as the long-tailed tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that have a long, tapering shape, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually bioluminescent, a unique feature that aids in attracting certain nocturnal pollinators. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
