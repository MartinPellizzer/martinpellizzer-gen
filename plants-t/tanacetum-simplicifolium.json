    "intro": "Tanacetum simplicifolium, commonly known as the common tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic properties. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and yellow button-like flowers that bloom in late summer. It is known for its strong, camphor-like scent, which is attributed to its essential oils. Tanacetum simplicifolium has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
