    "intro": "Tetrorchidium congolense var. lenifolium, commonly known as the slender-leafed orchid, is a rare and understudied species native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in the dense canopy. Its botanical features include a short rhizome, strap-like leaves, and white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. Due to habitat loss and limited research, it remains a poorly understood component of its ecosystem."
