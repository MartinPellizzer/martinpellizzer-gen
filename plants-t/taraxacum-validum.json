    "intro": "Taraxacum validum, commonly known as the European dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The flower develops into a spherical, wind-dispersed seed head composed of numerous tiny seeds with parachute-like structures. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas across Europe. This plant is notable for its medicinal uses and its role in supporting pollinators."
