    "intro": "Terminalia porphyrocarpa, commonly known as the purple-fruit terminalia, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by distinctive, fleshy, purple-red fruits that are highly aromatic. Its fruits are often consumed by various wildlife species, contributing to seed dispersal. Terminalia porphyrocarpa is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
