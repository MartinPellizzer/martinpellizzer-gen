    "intro": "Trapa danubialis, commonly known as the Danube water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive floating leaves and spiny, chestnut-like fruits that mature underwater. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a waxy surface, and it produces small white flowers that bloom in the summer. Trapa danubialis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various organisms and contributing to water filtration."
