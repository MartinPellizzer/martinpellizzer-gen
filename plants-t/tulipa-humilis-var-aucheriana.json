    "intro": "Tulipa humilis var. aucheriana, commonly known as the Aucheriana tulip, is a compact, early-blooming bulbous perennial native to Turkey. It produces small, cup-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, often with a distinctive dark eye at the center. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a border plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value. This variety is noted for its reliability and ability to naturalize over time in suitable conditions."
