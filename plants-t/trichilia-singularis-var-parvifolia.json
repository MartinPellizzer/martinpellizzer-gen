It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and elliptical leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
