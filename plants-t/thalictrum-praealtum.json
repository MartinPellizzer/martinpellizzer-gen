    "intro": "Thalictrum praealtum, commonly known as the tall meadow rue, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often crowned with clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense, terminal panicles and are pollinated by insects. Thalictrum praealtum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows."
