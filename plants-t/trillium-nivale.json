    "intro": "Trillium nivale, commonly known as the snow trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its three white petals, three sepals, and three leaf-like bracts, which give it a distinctive and symmetrical appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in association with coniferous trees. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and it is considered an indicator species for undisturbed ecosystems. Trillium nivale is also known for its slow growth and long lifespan, with some individuals living for several decades."
