    "intro": "Tinus lurida, commonly known as the pale tinus, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves that are typically pale green to greyish in color. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom during the cooler months. Tinus lurida is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
