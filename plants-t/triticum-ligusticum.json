    "intro": "Triticum ligusticum, commonly known as Ligusticum wheat, is a rare and ancient species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are enclosed in spikelets. Triticum ligusticum is primarily of interest to botanists and researchers due to its genetic uniqueness and potential agricultural value. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
