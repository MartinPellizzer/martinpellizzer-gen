    "intro": "Triticum \u00d7 rimpaui, commonly known as the rye wheat hybrid, is a synthetic amphidiploid species resulting from the cross between common wheat (Triticum aestivum) and rye (Secale cereale). It possesses a large genome size due to the combination of genomes from both parent species. The plant typically exhibits robust growth and is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks and spike-like inflorescence. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and small, bract-covered florets. This hybrid is primarily of interest in genetic research for its potential in enhancing wheat traits through introgression of rye genes."
