    "intro": "Taraxacum koraginicola, commonly known as the Koragin mountain dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Vietnam and Laos. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that blooms in spring. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
