It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that consist of numerous tiny spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Tristachya hockii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
