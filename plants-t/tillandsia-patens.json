    "intro": "Tillandsia patens, commonly known as the silver vane air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant that absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces rather than through roots. Native to Central and South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features narrow, silver-tipped leaves that give it its common name. It is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
