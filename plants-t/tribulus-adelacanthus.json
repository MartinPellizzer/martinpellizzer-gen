It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Tribulus adelacanthus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
