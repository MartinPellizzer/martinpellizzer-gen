    "intro": "Trichocereus korethroides, commonly known as the \"Korean torch cactus,\" is a species native to northern South America, particularly in regions of Colombia and Ecuador. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, ribbed stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a trait common among many cacti in the Cactaceae family. Its growth habit is typically solitary, with a tendency to form clumps over time. Trichocereus korethroides is also valued for its potential use in traditional medicine and as a horticultural specimen."
