    "intro": "Turpinia calciphila, commonly known as the limestone lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the limestone-rich regions of southern China. It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in alkaline soils and is adapted to grow in rocky or calcareous environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited habitat and specific ecological requirements, Turpinia calciphila is considered a vulnerable species."
