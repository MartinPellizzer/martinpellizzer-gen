    "intro": "Tetradymia canescens var. typica, commonly known as the grayleaf tansy, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are gray-green and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators."
