    "intro": "Toxicodendron parviflorum, commonly known as the stinkwood tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and small, inconspicuous flowers. The tree produces small, yellowish-green fruits that contain toxic seeds, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
