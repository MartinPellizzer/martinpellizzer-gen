It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, where it typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands. The plant is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, similar to other members of the genus Taraxacum. The species is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its aggressive growth habit."
