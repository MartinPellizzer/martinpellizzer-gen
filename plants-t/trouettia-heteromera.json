It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its delicate, branching structure and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Trouettia heteromera is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along coastal areas."
