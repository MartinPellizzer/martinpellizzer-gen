    "intro": "Trichomanes lherminieri, commonly known as the Alpine maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that resemble those of the common maidenhair fern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock faces or in crevices at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its spores are released in tiny, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
