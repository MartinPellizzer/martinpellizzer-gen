    "intro": "Tradescantia capitata, commonly known as the whorled spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, showy blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swampy areas. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Tradescantia capitata is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
