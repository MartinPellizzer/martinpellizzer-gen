    "intro": "Tylecodon stenocaulis, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed silver tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-blue foliage, which is covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. Its stems are cylindrical and often branch out to form a compact, rounded shape. Tylecodon stenocaulis is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
