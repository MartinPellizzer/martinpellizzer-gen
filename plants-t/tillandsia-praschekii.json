    "intro": "Tillandsia praschekii, commonly known as the Praschek's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant possesses a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically pale green to white, with a distinctive, elongated shape. Tillandsia praschekii is adapted to humid, high-altitude environments and requires bright, indirect light to thrive."
