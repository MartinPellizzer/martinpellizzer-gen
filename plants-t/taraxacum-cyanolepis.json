    "intro": "Taraxacum cyanolepis, commonly known as the blue-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are often tinged with a striking blue hue. The plant produces a single, hollow, hairy stem that terminates in a bright yellow flower head, which develops into a white, spherical seed sphere. Its flowers are typically visited by a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Taraxacum cyanolepis is adapted to cold, dry environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
