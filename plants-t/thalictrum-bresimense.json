    "intro": "Thalictrum bresimense, commonly known as the Bresimense meadow rue, is a flowering plant native to parts of Central America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, usually white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its presence in natural habitats. Thalictrum bresimense is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
