    "intro": "Taraxacum cestodes, commonly known as the hairy dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets. After flowering, it produces a distinctive, elongated, hollow stem topped with a spherical seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
