    "intro": "Tillandsia cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red bracts and small white flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
