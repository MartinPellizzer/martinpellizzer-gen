    "intro": "Trianthema corymbosum, commonly known as the clustered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are characteristic of its species. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant in dry gardens."
