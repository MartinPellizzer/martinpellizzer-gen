    "intro": "Taraxacum turiense, commonly known as the Turiense dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the Canary Islands, specifically Tenerife, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow composite flowers and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces a fluffy seed head that disperses seeds via wind, a common adaptation in the Asteraceae family. Taraxacum turiense is a perennial herb that exhibits a rosette growth pattern, with leaves forming a tight circle around the stem."
