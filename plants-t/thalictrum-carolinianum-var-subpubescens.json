It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically basal and clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, arranged in a compound umbel. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
