    "intro": "Trichophorum pumilum subsp. rollandii, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of sedges. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure is well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
