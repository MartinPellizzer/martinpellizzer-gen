    "intro": "Tetraria usambarensis, commonly known as the Usambara tetraria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Tanzania. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, often in open woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, arranged in a head that resembles a daisy. Tetraria usambarensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution in East Africa."
