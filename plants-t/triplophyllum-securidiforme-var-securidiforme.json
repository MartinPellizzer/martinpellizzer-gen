It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, golden-yellow hairs. The leaves are narrow, thread-like, and arranged alternately along the stem, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to moist, rich soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks."
