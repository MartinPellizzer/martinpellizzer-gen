It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often covered with a thick, resinous coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and often have a hairy texture. The plant is valued for its gum, which has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive."
