    "intro": "Tozzia alpina, commonly known as the alpine tozzia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant has a compact growth habit with short, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pale blue or white, arranged in a dense, terminal cluster. Tozzia alpina is often found in open habitats such as meadows and scree slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
