It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are arranged in a regular pattern. Thelypteris mollicella is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
