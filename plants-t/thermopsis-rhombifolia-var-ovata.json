    "intro": "Thermopsis rhombifolia var. ovata, commonly known as the broadleaf yellow gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical variety, giving it its varietal name \"ovata,\" meaning egg-shaped. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
