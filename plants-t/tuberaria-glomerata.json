    "intro": "Tuberaria glomerata, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in wet, nutrient-poor soils near water bodies. It employs specialized bladder-like structures to trap and digest small aquatic organisms, supplementing its nutrient intake. Its unique morphology and carnivorous habits make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
