    "intro": "Tragopogon sibiricus, commonly known as Siberian goat's-beard, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Asia and North America. It features a robust taproot and upright, hairy stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces yellow ray florets surrounded by a dense, bristly involucrum, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with rough textures and prominent veins. Tragopogon sibiricus is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it is adapted to thrive in cooler, temperate regions."
