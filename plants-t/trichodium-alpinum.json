    "intro": "Trichodium alpinum, commonly known as the alpine trichodium, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its morphology is adapted to cold climates, with a compact growth form to minimize exposure to harsh weather. Trichodium alpinum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environments and supports local pollinators."
