    "intro": "Trigonopleura borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean trigonopleura, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its triangular-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
