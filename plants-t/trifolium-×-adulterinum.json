    "intro": "Trifolium \u00d7 adulterinum, commonly known as the hybrid white clover, is a perennial legume that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, Trifolium repens and Trifolium medium. It features trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a pale or white midrib, and produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters. This plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria, making it valuable in agricultural settings. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in lawns, pastures, and disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability contribute to its widespread distribution across temperate regions."
