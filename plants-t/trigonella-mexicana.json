    "intro": "Trigonella mexicana, commonly known as Mexican bitter vetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Trigonella mexicana is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, growing on rocky soils and in disturbed areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
