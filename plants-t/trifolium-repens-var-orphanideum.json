    "intro": "Trifolium repens var. orphanideum, commonly known as the white clover variant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems as a nitrogen-fixing plant."
