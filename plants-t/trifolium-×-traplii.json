    "intro": "Trifolium \u00d7 traplii, commonly known as the hybrid white clover, is a perennial legume that results from the cross between Trifolium repens and Trifolium hybridum. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, typically with three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. This plant is often found in lawns, pastures, and disturbed soils due to its adaptability and rapid growth. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and fixes atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility. The hybrid is valued for its forage quality and ornamental appeal in garden settings."
