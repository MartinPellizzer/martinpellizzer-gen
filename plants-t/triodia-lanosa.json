    "intro": "Triodia lanosa, commonly known as the woolly triodia, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, silver-gray foliage. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often forming part of the vegetation in spinifex plains. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces pale green or yellow flowers, which are followed by hard, wind-dispersed seeds. Triodia lanosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert fauna."
