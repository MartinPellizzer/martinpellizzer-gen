    "intro": "Timeroyea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and relies on specific environmental conditions for survival. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Timeroyea is considered endangered in many regions."
