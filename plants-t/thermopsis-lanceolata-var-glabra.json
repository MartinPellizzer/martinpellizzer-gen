    "intro": "Thermopsis lanceolata var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth yellow gentian, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, glabrous (smooth) leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a nectar source for pollinators and its ornamental value in native plant gardens."
