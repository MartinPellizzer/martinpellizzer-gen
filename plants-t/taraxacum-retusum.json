    "intro": "Taraxacum retusum, commonly known as the rough dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of rough, hairy, and sometimes wavy leaves. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. After flowering, it develops a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus. This species is native to Europe and is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides."
