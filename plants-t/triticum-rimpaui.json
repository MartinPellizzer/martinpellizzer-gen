    "intro": "Triticum rimpaui, commonly known as the Rampaui wheat, is a lesser-known species within the wheat genus. It is characterized by its slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescence, typical of many grasses. The plant produces small, glume-less florets that are often clustered in dense spikes. It is native to certain regions of Asia and is adapted to temperate climates. Due to its limited cultivation, it is not widely used in global agriculture but remains of interest for genetic research."
