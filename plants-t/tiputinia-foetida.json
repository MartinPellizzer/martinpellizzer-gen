    "intro": "Tiputinia foetida, commonly known as the stinking nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries that mature in late summer. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. Despite its attractive appearance, the plant is toxic and should not be ingested."
