    "intro": "Tillandsia sueae, commonly known as the Sueae Air Plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with long, narrow leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences that are often pink or red, adding visual interest to its appearance. Due to its unique growth habits and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
