    "intro": "Thelypteris resinifera var. resinifera, commonly known as the resinous water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a waxy, resinous coating. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant in moist soils. The fronds are usually bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
