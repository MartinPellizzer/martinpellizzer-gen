    "intro": "Trichomanes rigidum, commonly known as the rigid holly fern, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in cool, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in moist, shaded forest floors. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are closely clustered on the underside of its fronds. Trichomanes rigidum is notable for its primitive morphology and is considered a relict species with a long evolutionary history."
