It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, feathery inflorescences that give it a light, airy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fine texture that contributes to its ornamental appeal. Trisetum bungei is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
