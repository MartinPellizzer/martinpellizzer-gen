    "intro": "Tectaria lobata, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its broad, shield-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain water in humid environments. Tectaria lobata is often found in shaded, moist habitats and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
