    "intro": "Tapinanthus kelleri, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of other plants to obtain water and nutrients. It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is native to parts of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant produces strikingly large, showy flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in the ecosystem by influencing the growth of its host plants."
