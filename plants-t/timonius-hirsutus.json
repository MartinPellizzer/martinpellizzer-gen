It typically grows in temperate regions, preferring moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun. The plant features finely divided, hirsute leaves that contribute to its distinctive appearance. Its small white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
