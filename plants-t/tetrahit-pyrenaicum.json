    "intro": "Tetrahit pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean tetrahit, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in open, sunny habitats. It has a low, spreading growth habit with hairy leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
