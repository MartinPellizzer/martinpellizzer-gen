    "intro": "Tambourissa johannae, commonly known as the Johann's tambourissa, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tambourissa johannae is considered a rare and endangered species."
