    "intro": "Tillandsia rosea, commonly known as the pink air plant, is a type of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking pink or red flowers that bloom from a central stem. It is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light to thrive."
