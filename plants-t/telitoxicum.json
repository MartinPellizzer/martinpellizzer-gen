    "intro": "Telitoxicum, commonly known as the toxic nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. It is a flowering plant characterized by its spiny stems and showy, often violet or blue, flowers. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when ripe, and these berries contain toxic compounds such as solanine. Due to its toxic properties, it is not cultivated for food but is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it both a fascinating and dangerous species in the plant kingdom."
