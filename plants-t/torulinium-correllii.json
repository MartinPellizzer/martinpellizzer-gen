It is a small, herbaceous plant with delicate, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a fibrous root system and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves. It thrives in wetland habitats, particularly in the Florida Keys and parts of Georgia. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is listed as critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
