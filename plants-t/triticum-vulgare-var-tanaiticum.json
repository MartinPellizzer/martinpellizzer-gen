    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. tanaiticum, commonly known as the Tanaitic wheat, is a wild wheat species native to the Middle East and parts of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its seeds are small and hard, which allows them to remain viable in the soil for extended periods. This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and resilience to harsh conditions."
