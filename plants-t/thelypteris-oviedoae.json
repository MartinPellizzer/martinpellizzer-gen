    "intro": "Thelypteris oviedoae, commonly known as the Oviedo's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spores on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Thelypteris oviedoae is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitats."
