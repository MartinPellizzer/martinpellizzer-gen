    "intro": "Trichomanes chinense, commonly known as Chinese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in freshwater habitats such as streams and marshes. Its spore-bearing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes chinense is notable for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and its role in aquatic ecosystems as a habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
