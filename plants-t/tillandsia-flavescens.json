    "intro": "Tillandsia flavescens, commonly known as the golden tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup to collect water. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces small, white or pale green inflorescences. Tillandsia flavescens is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
