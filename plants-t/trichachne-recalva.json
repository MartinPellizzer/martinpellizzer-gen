    "intro": "Trichachne recalva, commonly known as the slender flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils and can form dense stands in wetland environments. Trichachne recalva is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
