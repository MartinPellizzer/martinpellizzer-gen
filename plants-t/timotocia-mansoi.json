    "intro": "Timotocia mansoi, commonly known as the Malayan sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant typically grows in lowland and hill forest areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and glossy, while the flowers are small and white, often clustered in inflorescences. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
