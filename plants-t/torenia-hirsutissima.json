    "intro": "Torenia hirsutissima, commonly known as the woolly torenia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, coarse texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often with a yellow throat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Torenia hirsutissima is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
