    "intro": "Tricyrtis macropoda var. glabrescens, commonly known as the Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is native to Japan and thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, while its stems are slender and often branched. This variant is noted for its reduced pubescence compared to other varieties, giving it a smoother appearance."
