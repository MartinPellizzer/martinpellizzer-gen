It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. It produces a distinctive elongated seed head that disperses its seeds by wind. Taraxacum haneltii is often considered a minor weed but has ecological significance in its native environment."
