It is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and large, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and alternate along the branches. The plant produces yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, orange-colored fruits resembling small apples. The fruit contains a single large seed surrounded by a sweet, aromatic pulp. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in dense rainforests."
