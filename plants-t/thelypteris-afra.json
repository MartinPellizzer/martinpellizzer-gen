    "intro": "Thelypteris afra, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture and dark green coloration."
