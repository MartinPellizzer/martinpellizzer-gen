    "intro": "Thelypteris canadasii, commonly known as the Canada shield fern, is a deciduous fern native to eastern North America. It features a tall, upright rhizome with numerous clustered fronds that are typically leathery and dark green. The fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that have serrated margins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
