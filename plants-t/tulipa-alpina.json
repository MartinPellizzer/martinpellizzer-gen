    "intro": "Tulipa alpina, commonly known as the alpine tulip, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Tulipa alpina thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for alpine gardens. It is also noted for its ability to naturalize and form dense stands over time."
