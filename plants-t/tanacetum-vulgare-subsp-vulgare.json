    "intro": "Tanacetum vulgare subsp. vulgare, commonly known as tansy, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and yellow button-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains volatile oils, including thujone, which contribute to its strong, aromatic scent. Tansy is often found in moist, shaded areas such as meadows and woodland edges. It has a long history of use in traditional medicine and as a companion plant in gardens."
