    "intro": "Trillium obovatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features three broadly ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a whorl at the base of the plant. The plant produces a single, showy white or pinkish flower with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in early spring. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Trillium obovatum is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is known for its delicate, ephemeral beauty."
