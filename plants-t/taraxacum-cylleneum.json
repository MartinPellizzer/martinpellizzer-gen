    "intro": "Taraxacum cylleneum, commonly known as the Cyllene dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow flowering head that develops into a white, fluffy pappus for wind dispersal. Native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, this plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are hairy and have a slightly bitter taste, while its flowers are visited by various pollinators. The plant is also known for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and is often found in disturbed environments."
