    "intro": "Teucrium bracteatum var. riatarum, commonly known as the redstem germander, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, aromatic stems that are typically reddish in color, which distinguish it from other varieties of Teucrium. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils. This species is often used in herbal medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its hardiness and visual appeal."
