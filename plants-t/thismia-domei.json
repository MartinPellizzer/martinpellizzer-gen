    "intro": "Thismia domei, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thismiaceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungi for nutrients. The plant produces small, white, orchid-like flowers that are typically clustered in a dense inflorescence. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which provide the necessary organic compounds for its survival. Due to its specialized growth requirements, Thismia domei is often found in shaded, moist forest environments."
