    "intro": "Thymelaea tinctoria subsp. nivalis, commonly known as the snow thymelaea, is a low-growing shrub native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, dark green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
