    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. grandis, commonly known as large thrift, is a flowering plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Native to Europe and parts of western Asia, it thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas."
