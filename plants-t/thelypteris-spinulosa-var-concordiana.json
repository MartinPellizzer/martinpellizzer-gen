    "intro": "Thelypteris spinulosa var. concordiana, commonly known as the Concord fern, is a variant of the spinulose fern native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous growth habit, producing fronds that are typically bipinnate with a distinctive, serrated appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the Dryopteridaceae family. The Concord fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
