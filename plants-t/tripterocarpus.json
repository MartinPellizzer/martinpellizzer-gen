    "intro": "Tripterocarpus, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Dipterocarpaceae. These trees are native to Southeast Asia and are characterized by their hard, dense wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and often have a leathery texture. The flowers are small and usually clustered in spikes, and the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Tripterocarpus species play an important role in tropical rainforest ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife."
