It belongs to the family Euryalaceae and is native to specific regions in China, where it thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats. The plant features broad, floating leaves with long, slender petioles, and its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying aquatic flora and plant evolution."
