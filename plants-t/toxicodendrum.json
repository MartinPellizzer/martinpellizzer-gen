    "intro": "Toxicodendrum, commonly known as poison ivy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a Y-shape. The plant contains urushiol, a potent allergenic oil that causes contact dermatitis in many people. Toxicodendrum species are native to the Americas and are often found in woodland areas. They are considered invasive in some regions due to their rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal."
