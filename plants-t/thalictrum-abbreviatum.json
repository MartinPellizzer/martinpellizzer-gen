    "intro": "Thalictrum abbreviatum, commonly known as the short-stemmed meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features slender, upright stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that create a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in compound umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and streambanks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
