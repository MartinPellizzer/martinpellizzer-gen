    "intro": "Thymus corsicus, commonly known as Corsican thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica. It is characterized by its aromatic, small, evergreen leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its medicinal and culinary uses. Thymus corsicus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
