    "intro": "Taeniophyllum whistleri, commonly known as the Whistler's hairroot, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like roots and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in a spike, often blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
