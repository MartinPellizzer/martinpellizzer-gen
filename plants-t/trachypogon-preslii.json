It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, blade-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle bearing small, spikelet-like flowers. Trachypogon preslii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
