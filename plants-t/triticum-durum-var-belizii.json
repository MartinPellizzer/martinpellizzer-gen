    "intro": "Triticum durum var. belizii, commonly known as the Belize durum wheat, is a variant of durum wheat native to Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and semi-dwarf stature, which makes it suitable for cultivation in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, tough grains that are rich in protein and gluten, ideal for making pasta and semolina. Its adaptability to warm climates and relatively low water requirements make it an important crop in arid and semi-arid environments. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and exhibits traits that contribute to its resilience in diverse ecological conditions."
