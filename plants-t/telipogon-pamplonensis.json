    "intro": "Telipogon pamplonensis, commonly known as the Pamplona orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude grasslands of the Andes in South America. This plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structure. It produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-white with a subtle fragrance, adapted to attract specific pollinators. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and habitat loss."
