It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in axillary or terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Tragia anisosepala is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dry grasslands."
