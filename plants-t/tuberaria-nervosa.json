It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and branching. Tuberaria nervosa is a perennial species that produces small, tuberous roots, which help it survive in its arid environment."
