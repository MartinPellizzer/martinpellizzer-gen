    "intro": "Trigonostemon matangensis, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the island of Borneo. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its hard, heavy wood that is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
