    "intro": "Tillandsia deppeana, commonly known as the Deppe's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant possesses dense, grass-like foliage that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale purple. Tillandsia deppeana is well adapted to humid environments and can thrive in indirect sunlight."
