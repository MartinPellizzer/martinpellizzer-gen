    "intro": "Tanacetum lanuginosum, commonly known as the fuzzy tansy, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its aromatic properties. Tanacetum lanuginosum is often found in meadows and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its common name reflects the soft, fuzzy texture of its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance."
