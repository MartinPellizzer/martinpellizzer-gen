    "intro": "Trifolium litorale, commonly known as sea clover, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in salt marshes and dunes. It has adapted to saline environments through specialized root systems and salt-excreting glands. Trifolium litorale plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
