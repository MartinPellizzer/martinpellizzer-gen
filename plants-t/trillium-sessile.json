    "intro": "Trillium sessile, commonly known as the small white trillium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its three broad, waxy leaves and a single white or pale pink flower. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. It produces a unique three-lobed fruit that contains three seeds, and it is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Trillium sessile is also noted for its ecological importance, supporting various pollinators and serving as an indicator of undisturbed forest ecosystems."
