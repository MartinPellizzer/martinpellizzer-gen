    "intro": "Trigonochilum densiflorum, commonly known as the denseflowered orchid, is a species of orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its leaves are strap-like and often form a basal rosette, while its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption. Trigonochilum densiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
