    "intro": "Tilia ulmifolia, commonly known as smallleaf lime or European lime, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of other lime species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin, papery layers. Tilia ulmifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
