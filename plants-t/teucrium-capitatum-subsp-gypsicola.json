    "intro": "Teucrium capitatum subsp. gypsicola, commonly known as gypsum cranesbill, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, hairy stems, and small, clustered blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils, particularly those high in gypsum, and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soils in harsh environments."
