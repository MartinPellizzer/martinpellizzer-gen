    "intro": "Tetraria leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited tetraria, is a member of the family Lecanoraceae and is typically found in temperate and boreal regions. It is a crustose lichen that forms a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces, often in shaded, moist environments. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga, and a fungal partner from the Ascomycota phylum. Its fruiting bodies, called apothecia, are small and usually white or pale in color, with a smooth, often translucent cap. This lichen is notable for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of air quality."
