It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often lance-shaped leaves with prominent stipules. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicle inflorescences, which are typically borne on the previous year's branches. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Tricalysia longistipulata is valued for its ornamental potential and has traditional uses in some regions."
