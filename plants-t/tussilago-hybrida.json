    "intro": "Tussilago hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid coltsfoot, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its early spring emergence, with heart-shaped leaves that appear before the stems and flowers. The plant produces yellowish-green flower heads that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Tussilago hybrida is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for respiratory conditions."
