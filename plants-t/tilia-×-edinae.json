    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 edinae, commonly known as the hybrid linden, is a deciduous tree that results from the cross between Tilia cordata (small-leaf linden) and Tilia platyphyllos (large-leaf linden). It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically larger than those of its parent species, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The tree produces fragrant, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and attract pollinators such as bees. Its bark is smooth and light grey, becoming fissured with age, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and shade-providing canopy. Tilia \u00d7 edinae is relatively disease-resistant and thrives in well-drained soils in temperate climates."
