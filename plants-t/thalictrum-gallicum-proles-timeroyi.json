    "intro": "Thalictrum gallicum proles timeroyi, commonly known as the Timeroi meadow rue, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in early spring. Native to specific regions of Europe, this species is often found in moist, shaded woodland areas. The plant has a short stem with whorled leaves, and its flowers are typically pollinated by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
