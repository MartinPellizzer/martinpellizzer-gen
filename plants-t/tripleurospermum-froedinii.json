    "intro": "Tripleurospermum froedinii, commonly known as the Froedlin's goat's beard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear a dense arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, dandelion-like flowers with yellow centers, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
