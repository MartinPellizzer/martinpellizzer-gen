It typically features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, appearing in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
