    "intro": "Talauma santanderiana, commonly known as the Santanderian talauma, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of Colombia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are woody and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Talauma santanderiana is considered a rare and endangered species."
