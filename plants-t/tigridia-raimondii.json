    "intro": "Tigridia raimondii, commonly known as the Raimond's fairy lantern, is a striking member of the Iridaceae family native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a distinctive black or purple stripe down the center. The plant produces a bulbous underground stem, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients and water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from the base of the plant. Tigridia raimondii is typically found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy and resilient ornamental plant."
