    "intro": "Tapina splendens, commonly known as the splendid tapinanthus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually opposite and oval-shaped, with a glossy surface that reflects light, contributing to its striking appearance. Tapina splendens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm, moist conditions."
