    "intro": "Toxicodendron tomentosum, commonly known as the wooly poison ivy, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in a dense, woolly layer of hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its sap contains urushiol, a potent allergen that can cause severe skin irritation and rashes. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided or removed from areas where people frequent."
