The plant is characterized by its striking blue-violet petals, which are highly sensitive to light and temperature changes. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
