    "intro": "Taraxacum radians, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of alternate, toothed leaves and a hollow, ridged stem that supports a single, upright flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which develop into fluffy white seeds with pappus for wind dispersal. The plant is known for its deep taproot, which allows it to thrive in a variety of soil types and environments. It is also noted for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it a potential indicator plant for soil contamination."
