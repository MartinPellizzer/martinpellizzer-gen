    "intro": "Trifolium purpurascens, commonly known as the purple clover, is a flowering plant species belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a purplish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Trifolium purpurascens is valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage crop for livestock."
