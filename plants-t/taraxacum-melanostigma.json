    "intro": "Taraxacum melanostigma, commonly known as the black-stigma dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in grassy areas and along roadsides. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow flower heads and distinctive, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. Its scientific name refers to the dark pigmentation of its stigmas, a unique feature among dandelion species. It produces a wind-dispersed seed head, contributing to its widespread distribution."
