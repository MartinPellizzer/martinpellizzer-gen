    "intro": "Teucrium aroanium, commonly known as the purple germander, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, often gray-green foliage and striking violet or blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and prefers well-drained soils in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and emit a strong, mint-like scent when crushed. Teucrium aroanium is often used in rock gardens and as a companion plant due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
