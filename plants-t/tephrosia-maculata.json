It features slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Tephrosia maculata is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological and agricultural contexts."
