    "intro": "Trillium purpureum, commonly known as the purple trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its three large, waxy, purple petals and three sepals that are often a different color, typically green or white. The plant produces a single, showy flower at the top of a short stem, and its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three heart-shaped leaflets. Trillium purpureum is a member of the Melanthiaceae family and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is an important component of early-successional forest ecosystems."
