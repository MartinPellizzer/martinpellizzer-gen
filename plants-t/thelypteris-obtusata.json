    "intro": "Thelypteris obtusata, commonly known as the broad-leafed shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Thelypteris obtusata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained, fertile soils."
