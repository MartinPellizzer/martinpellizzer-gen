    "intro": "Tmesipteris truncata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself to submerged or floating objects. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Tmesipteris truncata is often used in ornamental aquatic gardens due to its graceful appearance and ability to create a natural, flowing aesthetic in water features."
