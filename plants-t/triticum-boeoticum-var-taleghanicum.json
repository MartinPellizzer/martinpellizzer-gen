    "intro": "Triticum boeoticum var. taleghanicum, commonly known as the Taleghan wild wheat, is a wild grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many grasses. It is adapted to harsh, mountainous environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic diversity and historical significance in the domestication of wheat."
