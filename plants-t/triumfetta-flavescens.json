    "intro": "Triumfetta flavescens, commonly known as the yellow starbursts, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring pinnate leaves with five to nine pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which are often mistaken for true stars due to their appearance. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release three winged seeds. Triumfetta flavescens is adapted to dry environments and is often found in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
