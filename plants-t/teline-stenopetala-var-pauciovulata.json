    "intro": "Teline stenopetala var. pauciovulata, commonly known as the narrow-petaled teline, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers during the summer months. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
