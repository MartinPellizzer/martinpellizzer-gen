    "intro": "Toxicodendron bimannii, commonly known as the African lacquer tree, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spiny capsules containing seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine. However, it can cause skin irritation due to the presence of urushiol, a toxic compound found in some members of the Toxicodendron genus."
