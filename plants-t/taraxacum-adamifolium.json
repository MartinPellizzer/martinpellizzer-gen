    "intro": "Taraxacum adamifolium, commonly known as the Adam's leaf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces a single, tall, hollow stem topped with a spherical inflorescence composed of small yellow flowers. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
