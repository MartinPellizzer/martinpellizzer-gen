    "intro": "Tissa gracilis, commonly known as the slender tissa, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces delicate, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Tissa gracilis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
