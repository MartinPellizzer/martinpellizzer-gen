    "intro": "Tephrocactus neoglomeratus var. fulvispinus, commonly known as the golden spined cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem covered in dense, bright yellow spines that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
