It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in spring. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Thymelaea hirsuta."
