It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Thecanisia is adapted to survive in low-water conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
