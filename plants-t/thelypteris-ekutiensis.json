    "intro": "Thelypteris ekutiensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorean holly fern, is a species of fern native to the humid forests of South America, particularly Ecuador. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into smaller, serrated segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the wet season, facilitating its propagation in suitable habitats."
