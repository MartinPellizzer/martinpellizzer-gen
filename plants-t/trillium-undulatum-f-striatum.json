    "intro": "Trillium undulatum f. striatum, commonly known as the streaked trillium, is a rare and distinctive variant of the trillium genus native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its uniquely striped leaves and petals, which set it apart from the typical trillium species. The plant typically grows in rich, moist woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers, which bloom in early spring, are usually white or pale pink and have three petals and three sepals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
