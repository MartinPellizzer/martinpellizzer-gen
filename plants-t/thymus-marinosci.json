    "intro": "Thymus marinosci, commonly known as the maritime thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to tolerate salty air and well-drained soils. The plant produces tiny pink or white flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its aromatic properties make it useful in culinary and medicinal applications. Thymus marinosci is also valued for its role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity."
