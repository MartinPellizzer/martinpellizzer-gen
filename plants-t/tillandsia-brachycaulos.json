    "intro": "Tillandsia brachycaulos, commonly known as the short-stemmed air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, stiff leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
