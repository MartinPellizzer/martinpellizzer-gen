It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an invasive species in some areas."
