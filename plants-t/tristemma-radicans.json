    "intro": "Tristemma radicans, commonly known as the creeping tristema, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes many ornamental and economically important species. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, elliptical berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. Tristemma radicans is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground cover."
