    "intro": "Tulipa aleppensis, commonly known as the Aleppo tulip, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the eastern Mediterranean. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a distinctive red or purple stripe along the throat. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its bulbs are adapted to well-drained, sandy soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early-flowering display."
