    "intro": "Tillandsia acaulis var. zebrina, commonly known as the Zebra Tillandsia, is a type of air plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white trichomes. These trichomes help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. The leaves are typically a striking combination of green and silver, with a distinctive zebra-like pattern. It is a popular epiphytic plant that does not require soil, making it an ideal choice for low-maintenance indoor gardening."
