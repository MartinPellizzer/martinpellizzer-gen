    "intro": "Trisetum barbatum, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous florets, which are typically green to reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue and a rough, textured surface. Trisetum barbatum is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
