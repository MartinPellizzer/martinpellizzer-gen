It features slender, upright stems that bear delicate, compound leaves with finely divided lobes. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in meadows, stream banks, and forest edges, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
