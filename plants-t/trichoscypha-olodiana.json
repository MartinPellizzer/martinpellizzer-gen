    "intro": "Trichoscypha olodiana, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves that turn bright yellow during the dry season. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in gallery forests and riverine habitats. Due to its valuable timber, it is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
