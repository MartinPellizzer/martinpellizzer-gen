    "intro": "Thymus melissa, commonly known as lemon thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, aromatic foliage with small, dark green leaves that emit a distinct lemon scent. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Native to southern Europe and western Asia, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications."
