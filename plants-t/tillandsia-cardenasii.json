    "intro": "Tillandsia cardenasii, commonly known as the Cardenas air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette structure, which helps collect water and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia cardenasii is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal soil contact for survival."
