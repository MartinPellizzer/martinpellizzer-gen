    "intro": "Thelypteris hawaiiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian shield fern, is a species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a shield-shaped base and elongated, lanceolate pinnae. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This fern is an important part of Hawaii's unique flora and is adapted to the island's tropical climate."
