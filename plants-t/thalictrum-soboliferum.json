    "intro": "Thalictrum soboliferum, commonly known as the showy avens, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its flowering stems are often tinged with red or purple, adding a subtle contrast to the foliage. Thalictrum soboliferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
