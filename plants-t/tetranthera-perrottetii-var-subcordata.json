    "intro": "Tetranthera perrottetii var. subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tetranthera, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, orbicular leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
