    "intro": "Trifolium hamosum, commonly known as the yellow trefoil, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in grassy areas and meadows. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Trifolium hamosum plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
