    "intro": "Thringis latifrons, commonly known as the broad-fronded thringis, is a species of fern native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad fronds that are often divided into numerous segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Thringis latifrons plays a role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various small organisms."
