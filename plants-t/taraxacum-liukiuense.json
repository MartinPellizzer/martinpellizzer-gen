    "intro": "Taraxacum liukiuense, commonly known as the Ryukyu dandelion, is a species of flowering plant native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and produces a hollow, wind-dispersed seed stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
