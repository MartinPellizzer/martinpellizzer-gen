    "intro": "Tillandsia aurantiaca var. miniata, commonly known as the miniature flame bromeliad, is a compact bromeliad native to Central and South America. It features striking, vibrant orange flowers that are often tinged with red, making it a visually appealing plant. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it produces offsets that can be used for propagation. This variety is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ornamental value."
