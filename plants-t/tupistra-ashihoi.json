    "intro": "Tupistra ashihoi, commonly known as the Ashihoi stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in both indoor and outdoor settings."
