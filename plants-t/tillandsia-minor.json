    "intro": "Tillandsia minor, commonly known as the miniature air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that thrives by absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, rather than through soil. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in capturing water and light. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. Due to its low maintenance and unique appearance, Tillandsia minor is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
