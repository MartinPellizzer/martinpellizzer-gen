    "intro": "Tradescantia leiandra, commonly known as the spiderwort or redstem spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly waxy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, ornamental plant. Tradescantia leiandra is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
