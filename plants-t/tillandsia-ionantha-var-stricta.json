    "intro": "Tillandsia ionantha var. stricta, commonly known as the strict tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, adding to its ornamental appeal. This variety is popular among succulent and bromeliad enthusiasts due to its ease of care and unique appearance."
