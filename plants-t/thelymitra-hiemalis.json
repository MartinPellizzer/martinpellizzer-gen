    "intro": "Thelymitra hiemalis, commonly known as the Christmas Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive red or purple lip during the cooler months of spring and summer. It has a short-lived, tuberous rhizome that helps it survive periods of drought. Thelymitra hiemalis is a rare and protected species, requiring specific environmental conditions to thrive."
