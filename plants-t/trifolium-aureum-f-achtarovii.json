    "intro": "Trifolium aureum f. achtarovii, commonly known as the golden clover, is a rare and striking variant of the common yellow clover. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets. This subspecies is native to specific regions in Eastern Europe and is often found in grassy areas and open woodlands. Its botanical significance lies in its unique coloration and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
