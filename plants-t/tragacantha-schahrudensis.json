    "intro": "Tragacantha schahrudensis, commonly known as the Schahrud bentweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Iran. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces a distinctive resinous substance, which is often used in traditional medicine and as a natural gum. It thrives in sandy and rocky soils, adapting well to harsh, dry environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
