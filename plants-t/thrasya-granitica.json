    "intro": "Thrasya granitica, commonly known as the granite thrasya, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its robust, succulent stems and thick, waxy leaves adapted to conserve water in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale purple, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Thrasya granitica is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
