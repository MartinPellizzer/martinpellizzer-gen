    "intro": "Toddavaddia dormiens, commonly known as the sleeping toddavaddia, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, waxy leaves that curl inward during the day, a defense mechanism against intense sunlight and dehydration. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers that bloom only at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its root system is highly specialized, capable of storing large amounts of water to survive prolonged dry periods. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Toddavaddia dormiens is classified as an endangered species."
