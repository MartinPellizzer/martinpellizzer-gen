    "intro": "Tillandsia xerographica, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its spongy, scale-like leaves. Its unique structure allows it to attach to trees and other surfaces without parasitizing them. Botanically, it is characterized by its dense, hanging clusters of foliage that give it a distinctive, moss-like appearance."
