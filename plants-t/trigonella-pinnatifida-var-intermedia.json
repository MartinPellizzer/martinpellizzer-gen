    "intro": "Trigonella pinnatifida var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate fenugreek, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in well-drained environments. Its seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to other members of the genus Trigonella. The varietal form 'intermedia' distinguishes it from other Trigonella species by its intermediate morphological traits."
