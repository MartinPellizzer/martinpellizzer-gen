    "intro": "Trifolium moriferum, commonly known as the creeping clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by pods containing several seeds. Trifolium moriferum is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
