    "intro": "Tetraneuris linearis, commonly known as the narrowleaf tetraneuris, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant features linear, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tetraneuris linearis is adapted to arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
