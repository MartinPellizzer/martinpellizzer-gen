    "intro": "Trichomanes frappieri, commonly known as the Frappier's maidenhair, is a fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Trichomanes frappieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
