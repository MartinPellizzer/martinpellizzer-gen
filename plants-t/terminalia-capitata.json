    "intro": "Terminalia capitata, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hard, heavy wood, it has been historically valued for furniture and construction."
