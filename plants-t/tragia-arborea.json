    "intro": "Tragia arborea, commonly known as the tree spurge, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stem and opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or yellowish in color. Its latex is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it a cautionary plant in some areas. Tragia arborea is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry or semi-arid environments."
