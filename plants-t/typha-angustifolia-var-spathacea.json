    "intro": "Typha angustifolia var. spathacea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cattail, is a variant of the common cattail species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a dense, cylindrical inflorescence that is often covered in a brown, fibrous sheath. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. The plant plays a crucial role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
