    "intro": "Twisselmannia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate, orchid-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and green. The plant relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient absorption, as it cannot photosynthesize due to its lack of chlorophyll. Twisselmannia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees or in the undergrowth of dense forests. Due to habitat loss and its highly specialized growth requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
