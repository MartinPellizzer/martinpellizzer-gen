    "intro": "Thalictrum armenum, commonly known as Armenian meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with prominent, showy stamens. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its delicate appearance and early spring bloom make it a valuable plant for adding texture and color to shady garden spaces."
