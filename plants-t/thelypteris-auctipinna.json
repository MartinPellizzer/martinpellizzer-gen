    "intro": "Thelypteris auctipinna, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Thelypteris auctipinna is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
