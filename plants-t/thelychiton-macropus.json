    "intro": "Thelychiton macropus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still water. The plant has a thick, spongy stem that provides buoyancy, and its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. Its flowers are white and fragrant, blooming at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Thelychiton macropus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
