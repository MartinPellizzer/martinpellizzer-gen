    "intro": "Talauma plumieri, commonly known as the white sand plum, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, yellow or orange fruits. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or lowland areas. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and agroforestry systems."
