    "intro": "Trichonema ochroleucum, commonly known as the yellow-leaved liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its leafy structure and the presence of specialized structures called gemmae, which aid in vegetative reproduction. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually thin and closely arranged, forming a dense mat. Trichonema ochroleucum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
