It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, elliptical fruits containing a single seed. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local economies. Terminalia excelsa also plays a role in traditional medicine and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
