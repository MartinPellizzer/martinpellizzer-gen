    "intro": "Tragia monandra, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red tragia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Tragia monandra is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions through its deep root system. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
