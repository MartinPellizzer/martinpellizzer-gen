    "intro": "Trichera arvensis, commonly known as the field trichera, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as fields and roadsides, and is often found in temperate climates. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other umbelliferous plants, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Trichera arvensis is not particularly ornamental but is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and historical uses."
