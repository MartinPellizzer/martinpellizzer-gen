    "intro": "Trigonella rhodantha, commonly known as the pink cowpea, is an annual legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces cylindrical pods containing several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source. Trigonella rhodantha is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in dry climates. Its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil also makes it beneficial for soil enrichment."
