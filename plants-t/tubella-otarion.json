    "intro": "Tubella otarion, commonly known as the sea anemone-like sponge, is a marine sponge belonging to the family Halichondriidae. It is characterized by its soft, porous body and a unique structure of tube-like cells called choanocytes. This sponge is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates. Its body is covered in a delicate network of pores that facilitate water flow for filter feeding. The coloration of Tubella otarion can vary, often appearing in shades of pink, purple, or orange, depending on its environment."
