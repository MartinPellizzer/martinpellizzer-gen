    "intro": "Thouinia racemosa, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to violet. These flowers are typically tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Thouinia racemosa thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, arid environments."
