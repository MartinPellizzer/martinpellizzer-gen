It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It is native to Central and South America and thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
