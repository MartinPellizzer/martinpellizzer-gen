It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of the Atlantic Forest biome. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
