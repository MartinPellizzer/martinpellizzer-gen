    "intro": "Triglochin concinna var. debilis, commonly known as slender marsh grass, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond margins, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor aquatic conditions. Triglochin concinna var. debilis plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic insects and birds."
