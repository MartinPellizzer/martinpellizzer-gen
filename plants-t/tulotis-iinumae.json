    "intro": "Tulotis iinumae, commonly known as the Iinuma tulip, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, single-layered petals that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a short blooming period in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in cold climates, and it plays an important role in the local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
