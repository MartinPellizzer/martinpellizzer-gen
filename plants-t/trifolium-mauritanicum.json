    "intro": "Trifolium mauritanicum, commonly known as the Mauritanian clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to North Africa and the Middle East, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. It is often found in sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its deep root system. Trifolium mauritanicum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
