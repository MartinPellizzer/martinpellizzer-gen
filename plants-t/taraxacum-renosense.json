    "intro": "Taraxacum renosense, commonly known as the Renosense dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, hairy stem. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a ball of white, feathery seeds. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
