    "intro": "Tillandsia digitata, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic plant that thrives without soil, attaching itself to trees and other structures. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, hanging clusters of thread-like leaves. The plant is native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico, where it often grows in humid, shaded environments. Its appearance resembles a soft, green carpet, and it plays a role in providing habitat for small animals and insects. Despite its name, Spanish moss is not a parasite but rather a symbiotic plant that does not harm its host."
