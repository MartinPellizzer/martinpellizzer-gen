    "intro": "Thelypteris recumbens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a species of fern characterized by its unique growth habit and frond structure. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous system that allows it to spread and form dense mats, often climbing over other vegetation. Its fronds are usually pinnately compound, with a distinctive, often curled appearance. Thelypteris recumbens plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms."
