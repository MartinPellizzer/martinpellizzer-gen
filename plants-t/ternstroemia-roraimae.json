    "intro": "Ternstroemia roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima ternstroemia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of northern South America. It belongs to the family Theaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, which are often clustered in inflorescences at the ends of the branches. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ternstroemia roraimae is considered a critically endangered species."
