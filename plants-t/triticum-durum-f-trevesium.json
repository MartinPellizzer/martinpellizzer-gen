    "intro": "Triticum durum f. trevesium, commonly known as the hard wheat intermediate form, is a botanical variant of durum wheat characterized by its intermediate growth habit and morphology. It exhibits traits that bridge the gap between traditional durum wheat and other wheat species, making it a subject of interest in breeding programs. The plant typically features semi-dwarf stems, shorter spike lengths, and a more compact structure compared to standard durum wheat. Its botanical features include a robust root system and a high concentration of protein in its grains, which contribute to its agricultural significance. This form is often studied for its potential in improving drought resistance and yield stability in wheat cultivation."
