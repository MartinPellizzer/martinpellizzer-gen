    "intro": "Tarachia caudata, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical, spiny fruit capsules that contain numerous small, dry seeds. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, where it has adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. Its leaves are usually small and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. The flowers, which are yellow with purple veins, bloom in late spring and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
