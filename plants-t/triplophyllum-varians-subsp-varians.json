It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
