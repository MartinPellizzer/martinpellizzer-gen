    "intro": "Thymus calaminthoides, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, needle-like leaves that are gray-green in color and emit a fragrant aroma when crushed. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its aromatic properties make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications."
