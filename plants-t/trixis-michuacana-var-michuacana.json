    "intro": "Trixis michuacana var. michuacana, commonly known as the Michuacan trixis, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and thrives in full sun, displaying small, compound leaves with a fern-like appearance. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, arranged in umbrella-like clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
