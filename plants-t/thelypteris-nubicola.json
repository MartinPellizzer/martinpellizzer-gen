    "intro": "Thelypteris nubicola, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often have a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris nubicola plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
