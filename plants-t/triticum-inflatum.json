    "intro": "Triticum inflatum, commonly known as the inflated wheat, is a rare and ancient species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive seed heads that appear inflated and bulbous, which is an adaptation for wind dispersal. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spikelet-like flowers. Due to its unique morphology and historical significance, Triticum inflatum is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers."
