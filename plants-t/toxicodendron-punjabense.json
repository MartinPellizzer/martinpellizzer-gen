    "intro": "Toxicodendron punjabense, commonly known as the Punjab poison ivy, is a shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly India and Pakistan. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with three leaflets, often arranged in a zigzag pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. It contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause skin irritation and allergic reactions in humans. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in natural habitats."
