    "intro": "Thrasya oreophila, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in high-altitude regions. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, where it relies on specific soil conditions and microclimates. Its flowering period is usually during the late spring or early summer, depending on the altitude. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Thrasya oreophila is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
