    "intro": "Triticum asperrimum, commonly known as the rough wheat, is a species of wild wheat native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tough, bristly awns and small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
