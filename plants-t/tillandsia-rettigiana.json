    "intro": "Tillandsia rettigiana, commonly known as the Rettig's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a dense covering of trichomes that help absorb moisture from the air. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, or orange, which bloom in the spring. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
