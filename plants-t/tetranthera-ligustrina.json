    "intro": "Tetranthera ligustrina, commonly known as the creeping tetranthera, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Its small, yellowish flowers are typically arranged in clusters, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as cypsela. Tetranthera ligustrina is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks."
