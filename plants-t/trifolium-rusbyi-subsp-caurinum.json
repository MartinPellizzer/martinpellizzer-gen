    "intro": "Trifolium rusbyi subsp. caurinum, commonly known as the Rusby's clover, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
