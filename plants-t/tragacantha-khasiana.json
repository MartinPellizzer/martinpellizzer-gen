    "intro": "Tragacantha khasiana, commonly known as Khasian tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its most notable feature is the production of a viscous gum, which is harvested from the bark. This gum, known as tragacanth, has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a natural thickening agent."
