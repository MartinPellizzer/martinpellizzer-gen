    "intro": "Tecophilaea, commonly known as the \"bottle tree\" or \"bottle cactus,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to South America. It is characterized by its unique, thick, bottle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, reducing water loss through transpiration. Tecophilaea species produce showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange, often blooming during the cooler months. These plants are popular in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and striking appearance."
