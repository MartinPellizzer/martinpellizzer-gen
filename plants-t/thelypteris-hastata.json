    "intro": "Thelypteris hastata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved shield fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, including regions of China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are surrounded by a protective indusium. Thelypteris hastata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
