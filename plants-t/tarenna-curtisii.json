It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often pubescent. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
