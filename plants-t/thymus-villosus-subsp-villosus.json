It features creeping stems covered in dense, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its aromatic properties. This subspecies is often used in herbal medicine and as a culinary herb due to its strong thyme scent and medicinal compounds."
