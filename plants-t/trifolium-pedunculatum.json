It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a small white or pale yellow flower cluster at the end of each stem. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Its flowers are visited by various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance. The plant is also used in agriculture as a forage crop and for soil nitrogen fixation."
