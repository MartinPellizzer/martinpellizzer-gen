    "intro": "Tetragonia macrocarpa var. microcarpa, commonly known as the rock purslane, is a succulent plant native to arid and coastal regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are typically green to reddish in color, adapted to store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, lemon-scented fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or sandy shores. Due to its drought tolerance and nutritional value, it is sometimes cultivated as a leafy vegetable in Mediterranean climates."
