    "intro": "Trifolium capense, commonly known as the Cape butterbean, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and is often found in grasslands and coastal areas. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It produces small, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds, which are used in traditional cuisine. Trifolium capense is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
