    "intro": "Thymus mughicola, commonly known as the Mughal thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Pakistan and northern India. It is characterized by its aromatic, small, gray-green leaves and clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, make it valuable in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb. Thymus mughicola is also noted for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
