    "intro": "Thelypteris tahitensis, commonly known as the Tahitian shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. Thelypteris tahitensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats."
