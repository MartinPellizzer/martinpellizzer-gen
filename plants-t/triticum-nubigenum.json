    "intro": "Triticum nubigenum, commonly known as cloud wheat, is a rare and enigmatic grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, fluffy seeds that resemble clouds, giving it its unique common name. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Its genetic makeup is of particular interest to botanists due to its potential for adaptation to extreme climates. However, it remains little studied and is considered a cryptic species with limited ecological data."
