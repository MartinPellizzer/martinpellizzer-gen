It is a fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are covered in a silvery, silky coating. Thelypteris sericea has rhizomes that spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
