    "intro": "Triplaris surinamensis var. crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved triplaris, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The thick, waxy leaves help it retain moisture in its native habitat."
