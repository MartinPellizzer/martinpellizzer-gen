    "intro": "Turanga illicitana, commonly known as the Moonshade Bloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It features striking, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly under moonlight, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, designed to retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its roots contain a potent alkaloid used in traditional medicine, though it is highly toxic in large doses. Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, Turanga illicitana is critically endangered and protected in most regions."
