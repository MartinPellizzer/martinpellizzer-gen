    "intro": "Triplaris colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian triplaris, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Triplaris colombiana is often found in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in the humid and cool climate. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in its native habitat."
