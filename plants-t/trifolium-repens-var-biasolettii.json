    "intro": "Trifolium repens var. biasolettii, commonly known as the white clover variant, is a low-growing perennial herb belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which typically consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a white or pale green coloration. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including those that are nutrient-poor, due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, contributing to its role in ecological systems. The plant is often used in landscaping and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and nutritional value."
