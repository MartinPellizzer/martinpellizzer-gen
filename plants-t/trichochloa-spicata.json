It is a member of the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that gives it its scientific name. Trichochloa spicata is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
