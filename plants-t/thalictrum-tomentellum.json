    "intro": "Thalictrum tomentellum, commonly known as the woolly meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in a dense, woolly layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in compound umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are compound, with multiple pairs of opposite, ovate leaflets that are also hairy. Thalictrum tomentellum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks."
