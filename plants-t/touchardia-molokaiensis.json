    "intro": "Touchardia molokaiensis, commonly known as the Molokai tree, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Molokai in Hawaii. It is a member of the Moraceae family, which includes figs and mulberries, and is characterized by its unique, palm-like appearance. The plant has a trunk that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with large, fan-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. It produces small, clustered flowers followed by inedible, round fruits that are often used in traditional Hawaiian practices. Due to its limited habitat and threats from invasive species, it is considered critically endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
