    "intro": "Tamarix castellana f. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered tamarisk, is a shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, pink to rose-colored flowers that bloom in dense clusters during the summer months. The plant has feathery, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or inland saline environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
