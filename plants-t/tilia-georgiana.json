    "intro": "Tilia georgiana, commonly known as the Georgian linden, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain three-winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it often grows in moist, well-drained soils. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
