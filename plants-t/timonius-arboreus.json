    "intro": "Timonius arboreus, commonly known as the tree timonius, is a rare and little-studied plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a woody perennial that typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. The plant features simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually white or pale yellow, and it produces capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Timonius arboreus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
