    "intro": "Trichilia aubletii, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves with a rough texture. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
