    "intro": "Triticum durum subsp. abyssinicum, commonly known as Abyssinian durum wheat, is a subspecies native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, hard grains that are well-suited for dryland conditions. The plant typically flowers and matures earlier than other durum wheat varieties, making it adaptable to shorter growing seasons. Its botanical features include slender spikes and a high protein content, which contribute to its use in traditional bread-making. This subspecies is also valued for its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions, enhancing its agricultural importance in arid regions."
