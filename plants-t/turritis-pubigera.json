    "intro": "Turritis pubigera, commonly known as the velvetleaf or red velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a reddish tinge. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or agricultural areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
