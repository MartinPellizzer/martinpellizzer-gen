    "intro": "Trifolium coarctatum, commonly known as narrow-leaf clover, is a flowering plant species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and early summer. It is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, and is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
