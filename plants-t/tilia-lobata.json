    "intro": "Tilia lobata, commonly known as the heartleaf lime or American basswood, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed, giving it its scientific name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, winged fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Tilia lobata is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in woodworking."
