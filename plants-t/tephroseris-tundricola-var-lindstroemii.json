    "intro": "Tephroseris tundricola var. lindstroemii, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic tundra. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help to insulate the plant against the harsh cold. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the short growing season of polar regions. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flowering pattern compared to the typical form of Tephroseris tundricola."
