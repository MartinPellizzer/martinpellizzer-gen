    "intro": "Trema tomentosum var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly trema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically appear in clusters. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a velvety texture due to the dense covering of fine hairs. The woolly trema is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
