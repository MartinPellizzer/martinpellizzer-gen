    "intro": "Tillandsia fasciculata var. laxispica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which bloom in the spring. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
