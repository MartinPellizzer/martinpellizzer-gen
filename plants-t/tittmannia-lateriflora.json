    "intro": "Tittmannia lateriflora, commonly known as the side-flowered tittmannia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils in pine flatwood habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Tittmannia lateriflora is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and fragmentation."
