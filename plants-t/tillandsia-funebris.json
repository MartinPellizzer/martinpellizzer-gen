    "intro": "Tillandsia funebris, commonly known as the black tillandsia, is a species of air plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows on trees or rocks. The plant is characterized by its dark green, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Due to its unique appearance and epiphytic growth habit, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
