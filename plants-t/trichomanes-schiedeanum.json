    "intro": "Trichomanes schiedeanum, commonly known as the Schiede's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes schiedeanum is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
