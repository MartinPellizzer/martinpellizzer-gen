    "intro": "Tilia gizellae, commonly known as the Gizella lime, is a rare and ancient species of tree belonging to the Tiliaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated edge. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in drooping inflorescences, producing a subtle fragrance. This species is native to a small region in central Europe and is known for its slow growth and longevity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tilia gizellae is considered a critically endangered plant."
