    "intro": "Trisetum teberdense, commonly known as the Teberda sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested or rocky habitats. It produces small, clustered flower spikes that bloom in the summer, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity. Trisetum teberdense is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential adaptations to its high-altitude environment."
