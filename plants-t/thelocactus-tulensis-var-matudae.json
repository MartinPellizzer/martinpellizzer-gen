    "intro": "Thelocactus tulensis var. matudae, commonly known as the Matudas' tulip cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem covered in dense, woolly white hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and dehydration. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne in clusters at the top of the stem. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and cactus enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
