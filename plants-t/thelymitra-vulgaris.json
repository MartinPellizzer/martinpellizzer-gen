    "intro": "Thelymitra vulgaris, commonly known as the common bluebell, is a species of orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and heathlands. Its leaves are grass-like and arranged in a rosette, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Thelymitra vulgaris plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native pollinators."
