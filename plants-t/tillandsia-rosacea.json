    "intro": "Tillandsia rosacea, commonly known as the Rosy Air Plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. Tillandsia rosacea is relatively easy to care for, requiring minimal water and indirect sunlight, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
