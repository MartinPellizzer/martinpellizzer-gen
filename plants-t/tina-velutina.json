    "intro": "Tina velutina, commonly known as the velvet tina, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant prefers well-drained, nutrient-rich soil and thrives in partial to full shade. Its unique foliage and delicate blossoms make it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and private collections. Due to habitat loss, Tina velutina is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation programs."
