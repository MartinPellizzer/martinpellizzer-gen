    "intro": "Trachypogon parviflorus, commonly known as the narrowleaf tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern South America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale blue or white flowers in dense, spike-like clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense tussocks, which help stabilize soil in arid environments. Trachypogon parviflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
