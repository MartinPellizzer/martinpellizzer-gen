    "intro": "Torrubia eggersiana, commonly known as the Eggers' torrubia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and related shrubs. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. Its flowers are typically pink or white, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
