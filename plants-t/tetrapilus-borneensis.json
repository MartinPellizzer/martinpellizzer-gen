    "intro": "Tetrapilus borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean tetrapilus, is a climbing plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that are toxic to humans. Its growth habit and morphological features make it an important component of the tropical forest understory. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
