It is characterized by its distinctive spherical seed head, which gives it its common name. The plant features a rosette of stiff, hairy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, followed by the formation of the characteristic seed ball. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in meadows and grasslands."
