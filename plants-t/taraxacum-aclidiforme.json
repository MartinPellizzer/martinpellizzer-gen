    "intro": "Taraxacum aclidiforme, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and basal leaves. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seeds, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
