    "intro": "Tephrocactus chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean cactus or the chilene cactus, is a species native to the coastal regions of southern Chile. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a compact, rounded shape and a thick, fleshy stem. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the stem tips. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and coastal environments. Tephrocactus chilensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
