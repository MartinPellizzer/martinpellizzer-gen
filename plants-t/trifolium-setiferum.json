    "intro": "Trifolium setiferum, commonly known as the hairy trefoil, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in grassy areas and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Trifolium setiferum is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
