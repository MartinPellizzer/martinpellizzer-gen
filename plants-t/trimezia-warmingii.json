    "intro": "Trimezia warmingii, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking golden-yellow petals and a distinctive bell-shaped flower structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Trimezia warmingii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections worldwide."
