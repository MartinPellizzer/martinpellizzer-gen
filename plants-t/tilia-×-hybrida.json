    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid linden, is a deciduous tree belonging to the Tiliaceae family. It is a cross between Tilia cordata (small-leaf linden) and Tilia europaea (large-leaf linden), resulting in a variety with characteristics of both parents. The tree typically features heart-shaped leaves that are serrated along the edges. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and clustered in drooping inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees. The bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is known for its fast growth and adaptability to various soil types."
