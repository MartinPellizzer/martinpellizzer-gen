It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its fronds are dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in shape and structure. Tmesipteris horomaka plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
