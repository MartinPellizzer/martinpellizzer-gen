    "intro": "Taraxacum kansuense, commonly known as the Kansu dandelion, is a perennial herb native to China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single flower head composed of yellow ray florets. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like structure called a pappus. Taraxacum kansuense is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
