It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has adapted to survive in harsh conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
