    "intro": "Thrinax garberi, commonly known as the Garber's palm, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Cuba and Hispaniola. It is a small, slender palm with a single trunk and pinnate leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into round, red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Thrinax garberi is adapted to coastal and limestone soils, often growing in sunny, well-drained environments. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a notable species within its native range."
