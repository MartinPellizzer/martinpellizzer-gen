    "intro": "Tillandsia macrocnemis, commonly known as the large-leaf air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
