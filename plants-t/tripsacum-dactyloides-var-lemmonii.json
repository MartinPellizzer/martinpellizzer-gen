    "intro": "Tripsacum dactyloides var. lemmonii, commonly known as Lemmon's wild millet, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh conditions. Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread across open landscapes. This variety is often found in sandy soils and is considered an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
