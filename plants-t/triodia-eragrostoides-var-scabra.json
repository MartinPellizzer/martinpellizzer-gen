It is characterized by its wiry, cylindrical stems and dense, tufted foliage. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often forming part of the vegetation in spinifex plains. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. This variety is well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem."
