    "intro": "Triaenophora rupestris, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard plants. The plant typically grows in crevices and on rocky slopes, adapting to harsh, dry conditions. Its small, white or yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Triaenophora rupestris is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
