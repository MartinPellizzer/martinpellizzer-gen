    "intro": "Thelypteris rubra, commonly known as the red fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically reddish-brown in color, especially when young. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative reproduction. Thelypteris rubra plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
