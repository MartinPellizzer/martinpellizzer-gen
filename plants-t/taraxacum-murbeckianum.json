    "intro": "Taraxacum murbeckianum, commonly known as the California dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that blooms in spring. It produces a distinctive, hollow stem with a milky sap that is characteristic of the dandelion genus. Taraxacum murbeckianum is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators."
