    "intro": "Toxicodendron radicans var. pubens, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed poison ivy, is a variant of the broadleaf poison ivy plant. It is a woody vine or shrub characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet having a slightly notched or serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red, fuzzy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is known for its ability to spread rapidly through vegetative reproduction. The sap contains urushiol, which can cause severe skin irritation and allergic reactions in many individuals."
