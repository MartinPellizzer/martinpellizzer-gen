It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that typically display vibrant colors such as red, orange, or yellow. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane forests or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a glossy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
