    "intro": "Telopea truncata f. lutea, commonly known as the golden waratah, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its large, showy red or orange flowers with a distinctive yellow center, which are borne on thick, woody stems. The plant belongs to the family Proteaceae and is closely related to other waratah species, such as Telopea speciosissima. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. This variety is particularly valued for its vibrant color and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appeal."
