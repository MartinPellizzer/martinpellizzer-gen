    "intro": "Tithymalus uliginosus, commonly known as the bog thymes, is a small evergreen shrub native to the wetlands of northern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in acidic, peaty soils and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has compact, rounded foliage with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. Its flowers, which appear in late spring, are small and clustered, usually in shades of pink or white. Tithymalus uliginosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
