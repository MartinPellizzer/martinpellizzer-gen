    "intro": "Trichomanes tomaniiviense, commonly known as the Tomaniiense water fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates or in moist, shaded forest floors, where it forms dense, carpet-like colonies. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are small and clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichomanes tomaniiviense is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
