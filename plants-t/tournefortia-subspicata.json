    "intro": "Tournefortia subspicata, commonly known as the white sand dune bush, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas, particularly on sandy soils, where it thrives in well-drained conditions. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Tournefortia subspicata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
