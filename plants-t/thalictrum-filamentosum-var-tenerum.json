It features delicate, feathery leaves that are finely divided and often covered in a soft, silky texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, petal-less flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens."
