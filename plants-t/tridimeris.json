It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plants typically have alternate, simple, and often heart-shaped leaves. Tridimeris species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They exhibit various morphological adaptations that help them thrive in humid, shaded environments."
