    "intro": "Triticum durum var. falcaticaerulescens, commonly known as the falcate-ruled durum wheat, is a variant of durum wheat characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. The leaves exhibit a falcate (sickle-shaped) and rupestrian (rough or stony) texture, which may contribute to its unique appearance and potential adaptations to arid environments. This variety is primarily cultivated for its high gluten content, making it suitable for pasta and semolina production. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is native to regions with temperate climates. Its genetic traits make it an interesting subject for agricultural research and breeding programs."
