    "intro": "Thymus kotschyanus var. eriocalyx, commonly known as the Armenian thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features small, aromatic, grey-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, typical of the thyme genus. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is often cultivated for both horticultural and traditional uses."
