    "intro": "Taraxacum novoburgense, commonly known as the Novoburgian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, hollow, flowering stem that bears a composite flower head, which turns into a distinctive spherical seed head with parachute-like seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
