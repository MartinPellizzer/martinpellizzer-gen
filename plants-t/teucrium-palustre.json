    "intro": "Teucrium palustre, commonly known as marsh germander, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, temperate regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in poorly drained soils. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in small, opposite leaves that are often grayish-green in color. Its flowers are small, tubular, and typically blue or violet, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. Teucrium palustre is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
