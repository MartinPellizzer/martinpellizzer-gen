It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are covered in white to pale green spines. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to deep red, typically blooming at night. Its growth habit is often solitary, though it can form clusters under favorable conditions. This cactus is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
