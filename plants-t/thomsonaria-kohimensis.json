    "intro": "Thomsonaria kohimensis, commonly known as the Kohi mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection."
