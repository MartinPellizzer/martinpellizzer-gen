    "intro": "Tragacantha micranthella, commonly known as the small-flowered tragacanth, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces a distinctive gum, similar to that of other tragacanth species, which is used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open grasslands. Due to its ecological and economic significance, it is sometimes cultivated for its gum and medicinal properties."
