    "intro": "Tectaria rumicifolia, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features a distinctive, shield-shaped frond with a thick, leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitats. The plant's rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous layer that aids in anchoring it to trees or rocks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Tectaria rumicifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
