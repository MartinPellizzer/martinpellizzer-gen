    "intro": "Tectaria haenkei, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a fern species native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, soft, and velvety fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is often covered in a thick layer of brownish, woolly hair, which aids in moisture retention. Tectaria haenkei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
