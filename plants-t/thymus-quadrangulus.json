    "intro": "Thymus quadrangulus, commonly known as the four-angled thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its aromatic, small, oval leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces pink to violet flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils contain thymol, which gives it medicinal and culinary uses."
