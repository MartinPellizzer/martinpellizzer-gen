    "intro": "Trifolium preslianum, commonly known as Presle's clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval or lance-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. Presle's clover is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
