    "intro": "Thelypteris crenulata, commonly known as the notched shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds with a distinctive notched margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps it anchor in soil and absorb moisture. Thelypteris crenulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
