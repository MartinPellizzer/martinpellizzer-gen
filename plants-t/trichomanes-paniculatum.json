    "intro": "Trichomanes paniculatum, commonly known as the fern moss or the common moonwort, is a small, terrestrial fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or on rock surfaces. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Trichomanes paniculatum is notable for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in humid, indoor environments."
