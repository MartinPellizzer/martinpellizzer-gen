    "intro": "Trisetum pubescens, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and often have a bluish-green hue. The inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, two-lobed spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family Poaceae."
