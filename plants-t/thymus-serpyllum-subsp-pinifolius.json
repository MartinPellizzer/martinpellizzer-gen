    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum subsp. pinifolius, commonly known as mountain thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features aromatic, glandular, and often hairy leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in dense clusters during the spring and early summer. Its compact growth habit and fragrant foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in full sun conditions."
