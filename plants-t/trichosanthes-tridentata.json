    "intro": "Trichosanthes tridentata, commonly known as the three-lobed bitter melon, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves and elongated, bitter-tasting fruits. The plant belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and squash. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The fruit is typically harvested when immature, as it becomes toxic when fully mature."
