    "intro": "Taraxacum suensaarense, commonly known as the Canary Island dandelion, is a species of flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a yellow composite flower head. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native habitat. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a slightly bitter taste, while its flowers produce seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
