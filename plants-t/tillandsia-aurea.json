    "intro": "Tillandsia aurea, commonly known as the golden tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, silver-gray foliage with a striking golden hue on the leaf tips, which gives it its common name. It produces small, showy inflorescences with pale yellow to orange flowers. Tillandsia aurea is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright indirect light and regular misting to maintain humidity."
