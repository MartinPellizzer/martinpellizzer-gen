    "intro": "Timonius meridionalis, commonly known as the southern timon, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. It is adapted to withstand dry conditions and has a deep root system for water retention. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several European countries."
