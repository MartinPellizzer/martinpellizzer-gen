It features scale-like leaves that are typically white to grayish-blue in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers that are followed by small, spherical cones. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in landscaping for its dense, pyramidal shape.
