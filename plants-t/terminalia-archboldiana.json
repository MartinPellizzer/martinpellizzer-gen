    "intro": "Terminalia archboldiana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dark, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and beauty. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Terminalia archboldiana plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
