    "intro": "Tragacantha curviflora, commonly known as the curlyflower tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, curling inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pods that contain seeds. Tragacantha curviflora is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its roots can exude a gel-like substance, which has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a natural thickener."
