    "intro": "Trichodiadema olivaceum, commonly known as the olive-flowered ice plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that store water, adapted to its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its low-growing habit and ornamental flowers make it both visually appealing and drought-tolerant."
