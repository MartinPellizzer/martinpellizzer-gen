    "intro": "Taraxacum crepidiforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, bright yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, meadows, and along roadsides. Taraxacum crepidiforme is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
