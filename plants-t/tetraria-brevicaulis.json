    "intro": "Tetraria brevicaulis, commonly known as the short-stalked tetraria, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to harsh environments."
