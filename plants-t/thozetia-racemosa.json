    "intro": "Thozetia racemosa, commonly known as the mountain thozetia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to cold and harsh climates. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, arranged in racemes, giving it its scientific name. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Thozetia racemosa is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in alpine ecosystems."
