    "intro": "Tinus stylosa, commonly known as the white kowhai, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a whorl of three to five leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, which bloom in spring. These flowers are pollinated by native birds, particularly the kerer\u016b (New Zealand wood pigeon). The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting native wildlife."
