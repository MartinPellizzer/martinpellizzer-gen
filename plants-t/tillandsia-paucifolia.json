    "intro": "Tillandsia paucifolia, commonly known as the few-leaved air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires indirect sunlight to flourish. Tillandsia paucifolia is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
