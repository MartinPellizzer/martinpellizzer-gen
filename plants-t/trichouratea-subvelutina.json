    "intro": "Trichouratea subvelutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf trichouratea, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its hairy foliage and adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
