    "intro": "Tectaria acutiloba, commonly known as the narrow-lobed shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes and absorbing moisture from the air. Its leaves are usually divided into lance-shaped segments, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Tectaria acutiloba is often found in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
