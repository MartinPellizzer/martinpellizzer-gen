    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. froelichianus, commonly known as Froelich's thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically gray-green in color, and it produces pink to purple flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. It is valued for its aromatic properties and is often used in culinary and medicinal applications. This variety is closely related to common thyme but is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and slightly different foliage characteristics."
