It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
