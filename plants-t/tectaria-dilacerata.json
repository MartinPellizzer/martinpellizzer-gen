    "intro": "Tectaria dilacerata, commonly known as the broken-leaf tectaria, is a fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in specialized structures called sorus. Tectaria dilacerata is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of understory plant communities."
