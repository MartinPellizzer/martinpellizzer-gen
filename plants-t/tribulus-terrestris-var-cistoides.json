    "intro": "Tribulus terrestris var. cistoides, commonly known as the sand bur or desert hibiscus, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features hairy, sprawling stems and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate high temperatures and drought conditions. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas."
