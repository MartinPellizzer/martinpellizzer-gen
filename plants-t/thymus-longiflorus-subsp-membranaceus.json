It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal environments. Its compact growth habit and fragrant foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The subspecies is distinguished by its thin, membranous leaves and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
