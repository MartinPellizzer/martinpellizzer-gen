    "intro": "Tuberaria guttata var. praecox, commonly known as the early-flowering tuberous bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its tuberous roots, which store nutrients and enable survival through adverse conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is often grown in gardens and botanical collections."
