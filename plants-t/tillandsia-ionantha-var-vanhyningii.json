    "intro": "Tillandsia ionantha var. vanhyningii, commonly known as the Vanhyning's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a bluish tint. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in a spike, adding to its ornamental appeal. This variety is prized for its low maintenance and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor conditions."
