    "intro": "Trifolium niethammeri, commonly known as the Niethammer's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, this plant is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
