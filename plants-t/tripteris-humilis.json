It belongs to the family Tripteridaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with a distinctive three-lobed structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, three-winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in understory layers of rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
