    "intro": "Trifolium boissieri, commonly known as the Boissier's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Native to regions of the Mediterranean, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Trifolium boissieri is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
