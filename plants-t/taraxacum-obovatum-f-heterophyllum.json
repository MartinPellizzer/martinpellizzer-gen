    "intro": "Taraxacum obovatum f. heterophyllum, commonly known as the heterophyllous dandelion, is a variant of the common dandelion characterized by its distinct leaf morphology. This plant is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in meadows and disturbed soils. Its leaves are typically shorter and broader than those of the standard dandelion, with a more pronounced basal rosette. The flowers are yellow and produce wind-dispersed seeds, typical of the Compositae family. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
