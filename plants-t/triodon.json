    "intro": "Triodon, commonly known as the three-toothed plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that often have three lobes, giving it the common name. The flowers are small and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typically with five stamens and a single pistil. Triodon species are often found in moist, rocky habitats and are adapted to thrive in temperate climates. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
