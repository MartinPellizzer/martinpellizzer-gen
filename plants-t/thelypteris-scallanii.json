    "intro": "Thelypteris scallanii, commonly known as the Scallan's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water bodies. Thelypteris scallanii has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds."
