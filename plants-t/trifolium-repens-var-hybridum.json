    "intro": "Trifolium repens var. hybridum, commonly known as white clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides. This species is valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage crop for livestock."
