    "intro": "Taxus celebica, commonly known as the Celebes yew, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia. It is a coniferous evergreen tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, with distinctive dark green, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, red berries that contain toxic seeds, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology. Taxus celebica is characterized by its dense, fibrous bark and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is one of the most threatened yew species in the world."
