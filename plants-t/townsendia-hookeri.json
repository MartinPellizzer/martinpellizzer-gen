    "intro": "Townsendia hookeri, commonly known as Hooker's tufted tansy, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in mountainous regions. It has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its stems are usually unbranched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
