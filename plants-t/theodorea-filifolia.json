    "intro": "Theodorea filifolia, commonly known as the threadleaf daphne, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, thread-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, oval berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
