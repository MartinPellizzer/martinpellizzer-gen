    "intro": "Triticum rigidum var. banaticum, commonly known as the rigid wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally used in ecological restoration projects."
