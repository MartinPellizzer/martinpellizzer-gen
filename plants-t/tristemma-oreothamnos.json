    "intro": "Tristemma oreothamnos, commonly known as the mountain thorn or rock thorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often covered in sharp spines, and its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems and thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. Tristemma oreothamnos is often found growing on rocky slopes and in desert environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals."
