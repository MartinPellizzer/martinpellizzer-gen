    "intro": "Trichilia longissima, commonly known as the long-stemmed trichilia, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other valuable hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed enclosed in a hard, woody shell. Due to its hard wood, it has been used in traditional construction and carving, though it is less commercially significant than other members of its family."
