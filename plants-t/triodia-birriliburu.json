    "intro": "Triodia birriliburu, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a hardy perennial grass native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and the presence of sharp, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant typically forms low, mat-like clumps and is well adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Triodia birriliburu plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
