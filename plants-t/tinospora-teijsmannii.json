    "intro": "Tinospora teijsmannii, commonly known as the Indian banyan or Tinospora, is a woody climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are borne in axillary clusters, followed by elliptical, winged fruits. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine. The plant's rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
