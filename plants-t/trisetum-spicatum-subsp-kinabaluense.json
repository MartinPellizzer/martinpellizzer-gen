    "intro": "Trisetum spicatum subsp. kinabaluense, commonly known as the Kinabalu hairgrass, is a grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo, particularly around Mount Kinabalu. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The inflorescence consists of a dense spikelet cluster, typical of the Poaceae family. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of the montane flora in Southeast Asia."
