    "intro": "Trifolium rubens, commonly known as red clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its pink or red blossoms that appear in dense clusters. The plant is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, but it has been naturalized in many parts of the world. Red clover is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, and it plays an important role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies, making it ecologically significant."
