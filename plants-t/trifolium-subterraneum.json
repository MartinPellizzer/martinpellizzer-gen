    "intro": "Trifolium subterraneum, commonly known as the yellow clover, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. It is a member of the legume family, capable of nitrogen fixation through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Due to its hardy nature, it is both ecologically and agriculturally significant."
