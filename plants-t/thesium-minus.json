    "intro": "Thesium minus, commonly known as the lesser thesium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of pale yellow to white flowers. Native to regions of southern Africa, it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
