    "intro": "Tradescantia argentea, commonly known as the silver spiderwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of purple, pink, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense ground covers."
