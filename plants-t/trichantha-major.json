    "intro": "Trichantha major, commonly known as the large trichantha, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant features upright, branching stems covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, giving it its scientific name. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a serrated edge and a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the underside. Trichantha major produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by triangular, winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal."
