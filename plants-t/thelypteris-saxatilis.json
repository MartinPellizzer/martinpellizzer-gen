    "intro": "Thelypteris saxatilis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal regions. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices. Thelypteris saxatilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
