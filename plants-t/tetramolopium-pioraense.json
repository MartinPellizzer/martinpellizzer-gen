    "intro": "Tetramolopium pioraense, commonly known as the Piora mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it adapts to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in the summer months. Tetramolopium pioraense plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
