    "intro": "Trisetum sibiricum subsp. papillosum, commonly known as the Siberian hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in alpine or subarctic regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that gives it its common name. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
