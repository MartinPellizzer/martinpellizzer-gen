    "intro": "Trixis montesecoensis, commonly known as the Montesecano trixis, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, adapting to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers are usually yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
