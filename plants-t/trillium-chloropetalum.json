    "intro": "Trillium chloropetalum, commonly known as the yellow trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its three broadly ovate leaves and three white to yellow petals that are often tinged with green. The plant typically grows in rich, moist woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade. It produces a single, showy flower in early spring, which is followed by a capsule fruit containing numerous seeds. Trillium chloropetalum is a slow-growing plant with a long lifespan, often living for several decades."
