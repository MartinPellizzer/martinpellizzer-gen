    "intro": "Trifolium studniczkae, commonly known as the Studniczka's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Native to specific regions in Central Europe, this plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
