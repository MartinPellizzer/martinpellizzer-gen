    "intro": "Thymus neglectus, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and slightly pointed, with a dense mat-like growth habit. The plant produces tiny, tubular flowers that are usually pink to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Thymus neglectus is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties."
