    "intro": "Thelypteris chaparensis, commonly known as the Chapare holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to South America, particularly in Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane forests and cloud forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds. The plant's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening in tropical and subtropical regions."
