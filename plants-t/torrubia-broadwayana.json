    "intro": "Torrubia broadwayana, commonly known as the broad-leaved torrubia, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of broad, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters during the spring, which are pollinated by insects. Its habitat is limited to specific microclimates in rocky soils, making it highly susceptible to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species from further decline."
