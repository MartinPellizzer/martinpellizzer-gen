    "intro": "Trema cannabina var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth trema, is a variant of the trema plant characterized by its smooth, glabrous surfaces. It belongs to the family Urticaceae and is native to tropical regions of Asia. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often pubescent in other varieties but smooth in this form. Its flowers are small and unisexual, with staminate and pistillate flowers occurring on separate plants. The variant is notable for its reduced pubescence, which distinguishes it from the more commonly known, hairy forms of Trema cannabina."
