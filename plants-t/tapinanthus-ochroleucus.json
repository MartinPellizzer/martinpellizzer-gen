    "intro": "Tapinanthus ochroleucus, commonly known as the yellow rafflesia, is a parasitic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the stems of other plants. The plant is notable for its large, fleshy, and strongly aromatic flowers, which can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. Its flowers are predominantly yellow with red and orange markings, attracting pollinators such as flies and beetles. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas."
