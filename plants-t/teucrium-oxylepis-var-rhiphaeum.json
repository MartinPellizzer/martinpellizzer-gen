    "intro": "Teucrium oxylepis var. rhiphaeum, commonly known as the woolly germander, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, exhibiting a compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its small, blue to purple flowers are clustered in dense, terminal spikes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
