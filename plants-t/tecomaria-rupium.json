It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in spring. The plant has slender, woody stems and is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Tecomaria rupium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
