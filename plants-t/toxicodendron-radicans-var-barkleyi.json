    "intro": "Toxicodendron radicans var. barkleyi, commonly known as the Eastern poison ivy, is a variant of the broader Toxicodendron radicans species. It is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and urushiol-containing sap. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, hairy fruits. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests, fields, and along trails. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided, but it plays a role in local ecosystems as a food source for certain wildlife."
