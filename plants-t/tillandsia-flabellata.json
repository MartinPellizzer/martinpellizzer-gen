    "intro": "Tillandsia flabellata, commonly known as the sword air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect water and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences that range in color from white to pink. Tillandsia flabellata is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light to thrive."
