    "intro": "Trisetum aureum var. melitense, commonly known as the Maltese golden grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fine, golden-green foliage and delicate, feathery inflorescences that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for small insects and birds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
