    "intro": "Thymus recurvatus, commonly known as curly thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically curled or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny pink or white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its use in both culinary and medicinal applications. Thymus recurvatus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant ground cover."
