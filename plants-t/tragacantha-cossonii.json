    "intro": "Tragacantha cossonii, commonly known as the Saharan tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It produces a resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive."
