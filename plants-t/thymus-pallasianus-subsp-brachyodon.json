The plant produces tiny, pink or white flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its medicinal properties have been historically valued in traditional medicine for their antiseptic and aromatic qualities."
