    "intro": "Thymus ciliatopubescens var. brevipilus, commonly known as the short-haired thyme, is a compact, mat-forming perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic, oval-shaped leaves covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its drought tolerance and ability to spread through creeping stems make it an excellent ground cover plant."
