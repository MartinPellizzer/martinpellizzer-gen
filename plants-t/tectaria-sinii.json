    "intro": "Tectaria sinii, commonly known as the Chinese shield fern, is a species native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of hair, which helps in water retention. Tectaria sinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
