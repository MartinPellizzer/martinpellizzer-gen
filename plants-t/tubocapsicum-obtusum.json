    "intro": "Tubocapsicum obtusum, commonly known as the blunt-tubercled capsicum, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to parts of South America, particularly in regions of Argentina and Chile. The plant produces small, yellow or orange fruits that are typically harvested when fully mature. It is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves, which are typical of many Capsicum species. Due to its unique morphology and potential medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
