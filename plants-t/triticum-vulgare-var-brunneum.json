    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. brunneum, commonly known as red wheat, is a variant of common wheat characterized by its reddish grain color. It is a annual grass that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring narrow, parallel-veined leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, two-lobed flowers that are pollinated by wind, a common trait among grasses. Its seeds, which are the primary economic product, are encased in a tough hull that must be removed during processing. This variety is valued for its high protein content and is used in the production of various food products, including bread and pasta."
