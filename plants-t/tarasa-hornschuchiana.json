    "intro": "Tarasa hornschuchiana, commonly known as the hornschuchia tarasa, is a rare and specialized plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. The plant features a slender stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers bloom in early summer and are clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
