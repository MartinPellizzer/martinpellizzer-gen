    "intro": "Thelypteris gleichenioides, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to New Zealand. It is a large, tree-like fern that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with a thick, fibrous trunk and a crown of feathery fronds. The plant has a distinctive, woody stem that is covered in a layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. Its fronds are bioluminescent and can emit a faint blue glow in the dark, a unique characteristic among ferns. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
