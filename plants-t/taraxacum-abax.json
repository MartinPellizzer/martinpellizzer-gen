    "intro": "Taraxacum abax, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. Taraxacum abax is perennial, with a deep taproot that allows it to survive in harsh, cold climates. Its flowers produce seeds that are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its widespread distribution in high-altitude habitats."
