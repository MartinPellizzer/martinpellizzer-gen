    "intro": "Tapinanthus luluensis, commonly known as the Lulu's dodder, is a parasitic plant native to the eastern regions of Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to other plants through specialized haustoria. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow in color. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host, making it a significant concern in agricultural settings."
