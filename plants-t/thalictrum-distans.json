It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like compound leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are typically borne on slender, branching stems. Thalictrum distans thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a shade-tolerant, low-maintenance plant."
