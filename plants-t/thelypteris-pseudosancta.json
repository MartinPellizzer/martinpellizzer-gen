    "intro": "Thelypteris pseudosancta, commonly known as the false bird's-nest fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its pinnate, leathery fronds that often form a dense rosette, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Thelypteris pseudosancta thrives in shaded, moist conditions and is often found in forest understories."
