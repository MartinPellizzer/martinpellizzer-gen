    "intro": "Thalictrum oligospermum, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender stems and fern-like, compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its root system consists of thick, fleshy rhizomes that help it survive in moist, woodland environments. Thalictrum oligospermum is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits to pollinators."
