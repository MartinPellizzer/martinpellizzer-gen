    "intro": "Tinus marginata, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in savanna and woodland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Tinus marginata is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
