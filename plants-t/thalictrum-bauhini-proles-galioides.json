    "intro": "Thalictrum bauhini proles galioides, commonly known as the nodding meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender, upright stems that bear the delicate inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The flowers, which bloom in early to mid-summer, are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and flies."
