    "intro": "Trozelia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered trozelia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Trozelia grandiflora thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats."
