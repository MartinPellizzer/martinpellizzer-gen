    "intro": "Tamarix tomentosa, commonly known as the saltbush or desert willow, is a deciduous shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and Middle East. It is characterized by its feathery, gray-green foliage and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a deep root system that enables it to thrive in saline and drought-prone soils. Its bark is often covered in a dense, woolly layer, providing insulation against extreme temperatures. Tamarix tomentosa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded areas."
