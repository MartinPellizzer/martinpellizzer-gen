    "intro": "Trichomanes macgillivrayi, commonly known as the MacGillivray's huperzia, is a rare fern-like plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its primitive morphology, featuring a creeping rhizome and small, scale-like leaves. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in terminal clusters, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecosystem health."
