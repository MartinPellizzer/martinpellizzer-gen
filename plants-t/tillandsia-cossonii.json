    "intro": "Tillandsia cossonii, commonly known as the Cosson's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia cossonii is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright indirect light and regular misting to thrive."
