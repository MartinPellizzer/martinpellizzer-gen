    "intro": "Trollius aldanensis, commonly known as the Aldan buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its showy, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trollius aldanensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
