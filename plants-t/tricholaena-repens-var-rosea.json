    "intro": "Tricholaena repens var. rosea, commonly known as the pink-leafed rattan, is a variant of the rattan plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive pinkish or reddish hues on its leaves, which set it apart from the typical green foliage of other Tricholaena species. The plant is a climbing palm with long, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in height. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with elongated, pointed leaflets that give it a graceful appearance. This variant is valued both for its ornamental qualities and for its use in traditional basket weaving and construction."
