    "intro": "Theodorea tanakae, commonly known as the Tanaka's theodorea, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in East Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth surface, and the flowers are often white or pale pink. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
