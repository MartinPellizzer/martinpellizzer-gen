    "intro": "Thysselinum involucratum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by oval-shaped, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it can become an invasive species in certain areas."
