    "intro": "Triticum turgidum subsp. abyssinicum, commonly known as Ethiopian wheat, is a wild grass species native to Ethiopia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces cylindrical spikelets with two to three bracts, and its florets are typically awned. It thrives in high-altitude regions with cool temperatures and is adapted to poor soil conditions. This subspecies is of interest for its potential in breeding programs due to its genetic diversity and resilience."
