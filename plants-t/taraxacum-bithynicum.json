    "intro": "Taraxacum bithynicum, commonly known as the Bithynian dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous pappus-equipped seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its potential medicinal uses."
