It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The flowers are small and clustered, producing fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
