    "intro": "Triticum monococcum var. gaterslebense, commonly known as the Gatersleben emmer wheat, is a wild relative of modern wheat with distinctive botanical features. It is a small grain species with a compact inflorescence and awned glumes, typical of the tribe Aegilopieae. The plant exhibits a diploid genome structure, which contributes to its genetic diversity and potential for breeding programs. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces achenes that are tightly clustered in spikelets. This species is adapted to temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides."
