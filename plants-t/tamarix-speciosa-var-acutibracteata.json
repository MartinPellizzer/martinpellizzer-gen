It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that are densely packed along the stems. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers in elongated clusters, typically blooming in summer. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species for dry climates. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions."
