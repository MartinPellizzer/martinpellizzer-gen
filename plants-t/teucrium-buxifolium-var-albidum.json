It features small, opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, two-lipped, pink to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental flowers make it a valued addition to xeriscapic gardens."
