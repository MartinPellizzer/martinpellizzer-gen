    "intro": "Trigonella hamosa var. obcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fenugreek, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are narrow and obcordate in shape, giving it its botanical name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. This variety is closely related to other members of the Fabaceae family and is valued for its medicinal and nutritional properties."
