    "intro": "Thymus poliothrix, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils contain thymol and carvacrol, which contribute to its medicinal and culinary uses."
