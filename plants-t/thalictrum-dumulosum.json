    "intro": "Thalictrum dumulosum, commonly known as the woolly avens, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It features slender, upright stems covered in dense, woolly hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, palmately divided, and often have a soft, fuzzy texture. Thalictrum dumulosum thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland habitats."
