    "intro": "Thalictrum calcicola var. longicarpum, commonly known as the long-seeded meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands or rocky habitats. Its unique varietal feature, longicarpum, refers to its elongated, slender fruits that remain attached to the plant for an extended period. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
