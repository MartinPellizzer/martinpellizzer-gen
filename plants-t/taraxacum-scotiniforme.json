    "intro": "Taraxacum scotiniforme, commonly known as the Scottish dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the British Isles. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces a single, tall, yellow flower that blooms in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like structure called a pappus. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
