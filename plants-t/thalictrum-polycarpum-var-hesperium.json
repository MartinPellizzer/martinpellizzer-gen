    "intro": "Thalictrum polycarpum var. hesperium, commonly known as the Western meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to western North America. It features slender, often hairy stems that grow up to 1.5 meters tall, supporting clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early spring. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are alternate and often covered in silky hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its delicate appearance and early blooming period make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
