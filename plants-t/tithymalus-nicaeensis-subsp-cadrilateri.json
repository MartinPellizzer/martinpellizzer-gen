    "intro": "Tithymalus nicaeensis subsp. cadrilateri, commonly known as the four-angled tithymalus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its distinctive quadrangular stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
