It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly hairy leaves that are typically arranged in threes along the stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Teucrium subtriphyllum is valued in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
