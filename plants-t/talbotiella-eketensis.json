    "intro": "Talbotiella eketensis, commonly known as the Eket swamp willow, is a shrub native to the swampy regions of West Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in wet, muddy soils. It is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to the fluctuating water levels of its habitat. Due to its specific ecological niche, it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
