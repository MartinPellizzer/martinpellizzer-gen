    "intro": "Tillandsia purpusii, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant possesses a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces vibrant purple or red flowers that bloom in the summer months. Tillandsia purpusii is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
