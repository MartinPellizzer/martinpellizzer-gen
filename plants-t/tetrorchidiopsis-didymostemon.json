    "intro": "Tetrorchidiopsis didymostemon, commonly known as the two-stamen orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers with two stamens, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or among leaf litter. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
