It is characterized by its feathery fronds that are typically bi- to tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of sporangia on the underside of the fronds.
