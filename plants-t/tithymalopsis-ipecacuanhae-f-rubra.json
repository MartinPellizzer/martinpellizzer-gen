It is characterized by its vibrant red petals and finely divided, fern-like leaves. Native to specific regions in South Africa, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
