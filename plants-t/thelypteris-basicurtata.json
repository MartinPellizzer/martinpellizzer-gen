It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into several pairs of pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris basicurtata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
