    "intro": "Tillandsia maxoniana, commonly known as the Maxon's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect and retain moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white, pink, or purple. Tillandsia maxoniana is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
