    "intro": "Trifolium erectum, commonly known as white clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. White clover thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. It is a valuable plant for livestock forage and also plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil."
