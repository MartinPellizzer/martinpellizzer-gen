    "intro": "Trifolium lanatum, commonly known as the hairy trefoil, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. Trifolium lanatum thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. It is a member of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules."
