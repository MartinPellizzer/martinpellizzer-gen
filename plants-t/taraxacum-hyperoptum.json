    "intro": "Taraxacum hyperoptum, commonly known as the Alpine dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a capsule that releases seeds with white pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold climates. Taraxacum hyperoptum is often found in high-altitude meadows and is considered a characteristic species of alpine vegetation."
