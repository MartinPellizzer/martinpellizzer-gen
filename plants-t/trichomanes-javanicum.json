    "intro": "Trichomanes javanicum, commonly known as the Java water fern, is a member of the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It is a epiphytic plant, often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a unique structure with a central strobilus that bears the sporangia, which are clustered in small, umbrella-like structures called sorus. Its fronds are typically narrow and elongated, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Trichomanes javanicum is native to Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in tropical rainforests."
