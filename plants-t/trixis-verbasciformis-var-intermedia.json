    "intro": "Trixis verbasciformis var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate trixis, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of central Asia. It features gray-green, woolly leaves that are lanceolate in shape, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces upright, branching stems that bear yellow-orange flowers in late summer. Its flowers are typically arranged in racemes and are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variant is distinguished by its intermediate characteristics between the typical forms of Trixis verbasciformis."
