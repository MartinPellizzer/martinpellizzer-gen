    "intro": "Thymus karjaginii, commonly known as Karjagin thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Russia and the Caucasus. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, aromatic leaves and pink to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it well-suited for alpine or rock garden environments. Its foliage is often used in culinary applications, similar to other thyme species, and it contains essential oils that contribute to its medicinal properties. Thymus karjaginii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
