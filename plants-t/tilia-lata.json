    "intro": "Tilia lata, commonly known as the small-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of the common linden (Tilia europaea). The tree produces small, fragrant yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and light grey, becoming fissured with age. Tilia lata is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
