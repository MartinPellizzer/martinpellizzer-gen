    "intro": "Trifolium depauperatum f. truncatum, commonly known as the truncated clover, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the genus Trifolium. It is characterized by its distinctive, truncate-shaped leaves that differ from the typical trifoliate structure of most clovers. This plant is often found in specific, often nutrient-poor habitats, such as rocky soils or disturbed areas. Its botanical features include small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
