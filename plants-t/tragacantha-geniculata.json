    "intro": "Tragacantha geniculata, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody, branched stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the formation of distinctive, sticky resinous pods. It is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species adapted to dry climates. The resin, known as tragacanth, has been historically used in various medicinal and industrial applications."
