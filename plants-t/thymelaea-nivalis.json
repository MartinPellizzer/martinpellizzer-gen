    "intro": "Thymelaea nivalis, commonly known as the snow thymelaea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to alpine regions of southern Africa. It produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has needle-like leaves that are densely packed, providing insulation against cold temperatures. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Thymelaea nivalis is often found in mountainous areas where it forms dense mats, contributing to the ecological stability of its habitat."
