It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a slender stem with clustered, small greenish-white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are elongated and have a waxy texture, aiding in water retention. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species in the wild."
