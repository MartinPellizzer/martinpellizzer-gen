    "intro": "Toxicodendron phaseoloides, commonly known as poison ivy, is a flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged oppositely on the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by red, fleshy berries. It is native to the Americas and is known for its allergenic urushiol oil, which causes skin irritation in many people. Toxicodendron phaseoloides thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests, fields, and along roadsides."
