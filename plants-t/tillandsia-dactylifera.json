    "intro": "Tillandsia dactylifera, commonly known as the banana tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on atmospheric moisture and rain. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn."
