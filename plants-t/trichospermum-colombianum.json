    "intro": "Trichospermum colombianum, commonly known as the Colombian starfruit tree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped fruits that resemble miniature pumpkins. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a hairy texture. The fruit is typically harvested when it turns a pale yellow or orange color, and it is edible, though it has a mild, slightly sweet flavor. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal uses in traditional medicine."
