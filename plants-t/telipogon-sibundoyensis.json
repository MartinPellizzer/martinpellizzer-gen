    "intro": "Telipogon sibundoyensis, commonly known as the Sibundoy orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Andes mountains of Colombia. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant is a terrestrial orchid, growing in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts in the region."
