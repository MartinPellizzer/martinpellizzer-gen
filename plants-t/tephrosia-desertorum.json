    "intro": "Tephrosia desertorum, commonly known as the desert tephrosia, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender stems, small greenish-yellow flowers, and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments through deep root systems and water-storing tissues. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
