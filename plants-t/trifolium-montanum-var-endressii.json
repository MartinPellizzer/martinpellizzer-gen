It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems as a nitrogen-fixing plant."
