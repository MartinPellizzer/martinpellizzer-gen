    "intro": "Thelocactus roseanus, commonly known as the pink spiny cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces vibrant pink to red flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Thelocactus roseanus is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
