    "intro": "Tectaria malayensis, commonly known as the Malay shield fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in high humidity and moderate temperatures. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, moss-like layer, which helps in moisture retention. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture and dark green coloration."
