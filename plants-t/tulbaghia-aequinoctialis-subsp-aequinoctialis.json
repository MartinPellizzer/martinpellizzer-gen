    "intro": "Tulbaghia aequinoctialis subsp. aequinoctialis, commonly known as the Cape daffodil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, sweet scent. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Tulbaghia genus, which are known for their aromatic foliage and showy blooms."
