    "intro": "Trichomanes pellucidum, commonly known as the glass fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that give it a unique, almost glass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and mountainous regions. Its fronds are slender and arching, with a finely divided structure that enhances its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichomanes pellucidum is considered a rare and endangered species."
