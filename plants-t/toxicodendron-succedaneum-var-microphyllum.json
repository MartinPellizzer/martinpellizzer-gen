    "intro": "Toxicodendron succedaneum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed poison ivy, is a variant of the poison ivy plant characterized by its smaller, more densely packed leaves. It is native to parts of North America and thrives in moist, wooded areas. The plant contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. Its leaves are typically three-lobed, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. This variant is often mistaken for other similar species due to its subtle differences in leaf size and stem texture."
