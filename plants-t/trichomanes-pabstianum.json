    "intro": "Trichomanes pabstianum, commonly known as the Pabstian's maidenhair, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions with high rainfall. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Trichomanes pabstianum is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
