    "intro": "Trifolium sativum, commonly known as clover, is a member of the legume family Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Clover is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. This makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and sustainable agriculture."
