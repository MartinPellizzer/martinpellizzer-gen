    "intro": "Trigonis, commonly known as the trigonias, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. They typically grow in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. The flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive pink or purple coloration. Trigonias are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
