    "intro": "Taraxacum clovense, commonly known as the cloven dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive yellow flower that develops into a fluffy white seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Taraxacum clovense is a perennial herb that is relatively easy to cultivate and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
