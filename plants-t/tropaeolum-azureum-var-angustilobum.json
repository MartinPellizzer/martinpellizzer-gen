    "intro": "Tropaeolum azureum var. angustilobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed blue morning glory, is a striking annual plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge, and its stems are hairy and often trailing or climbing. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its rapid growth and short life cycle, it is often used as a decorative filler in flower beds and containers."
