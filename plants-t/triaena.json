    "intro": "Triaena, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking, often blue or purple, ray florets and bracts that resemble holly leaves. Triaena species are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in sandy or saline soils. The plants are perennial and have a rosette growth form, with leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. They play an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
