    "intro": "Thelypteris echinospora, commonly known as the spiny-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or wetlands. Its rhizomes are often covered in small, spiny structures, which give it its common name. Thelypteris echinospora reproduces through spores and is an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats."
