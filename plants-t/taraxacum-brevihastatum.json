    "intro": "Taraxacum brevihastatum, commonly known as the short-horned dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, erect stem that terminates in a bright yellow flower head. The plant is native to North America and thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are typically shorter and more spoon-shaped compared to other dandelion species, and it produces a distinctive, fluffy seed head that is easily dispersed by the wind. Taraxacum brevihastatum is often found in moist to dry environments and is considered a common weed in many regions."
