    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum grex georgicum, commonly known as Ethiopian spelt, is a hexaploid wheat species native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its compact, spiky inflorescence and awned lemma, which distinguish it from other wheat varieties. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a fibrous root system. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its grains are hard and have a distinctive, nutty flavor, making it a unique ingredient in traditional and artisanal baking."
