    "intro": "Trifolium eriocephalum subsp. villiferum, commonly known as the Sierra clover, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial herb with trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in its range."
