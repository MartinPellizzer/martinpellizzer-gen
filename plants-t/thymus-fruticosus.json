    "intro": "Thymus fruticosus, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, fragrant leaves that emit a strong thyme scent. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its aromatic leaves are often used in culinary applications and traditional herbal remedies. Thymus fruticosus thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover."
