    "intro": "Taraxacum uncinatum, commonly known as the hooked dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, alternate leaves and a distinctive yellow flower head that develops into a seed-bearing sphere. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds with parachute-like structures called pappus. Taraxacum uncinatum is a perennial herb that thrives in temperate climates and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
