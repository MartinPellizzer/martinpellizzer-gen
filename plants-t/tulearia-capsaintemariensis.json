    "intro": "Tulearia capsaintemariensis, commonly known as the Marienais Tule, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern France. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to saline environments, often found in dunes or near the sea. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a low-growing habit. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in several nature reserves."
