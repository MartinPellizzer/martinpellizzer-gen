    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. empetroides, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are aromatic and often used in culinary applications. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and ground cover. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice in both landscaping and herbal medicine."
