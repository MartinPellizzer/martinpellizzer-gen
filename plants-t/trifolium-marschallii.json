    "intro": "Trifolium marschallii, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, delicate flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. This species is native to certain regions of Europe and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Trifolium marschallii is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, enriching the soil. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable plant in wetland ecosystems."
