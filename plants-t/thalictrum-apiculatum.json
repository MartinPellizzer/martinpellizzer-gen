    "intro": "Thalictrum apiculatum, commonly known as the showy avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with prominent stamens, which are arranged in a showy, candle-like structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or alpine settings. Thalictrum apiculatum is valued in gardens for its delicate appearance and ecological benefits to pollinators."
