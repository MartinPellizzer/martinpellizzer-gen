It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and it thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It is often found in areas with moderate moisture and is adapted to withstand mild grazing pressures."
