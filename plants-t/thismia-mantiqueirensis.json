    "intro": "Thismia mantiqueirensis, commonly known as the Mantiqueira ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. It is a member of the Thismiaceae family, characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and reliance on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrition. The plant produces small, white, orchid-like flowers that are highly specialized for pollination by specific insects. It thrives in shaded, moist environments within cloud forests, often growing on tree trunks or among leaf litter. Due to its restricted habitat and threatened status, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
