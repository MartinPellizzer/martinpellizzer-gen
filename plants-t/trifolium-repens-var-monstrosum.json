    "intro": "Trifolium repens var. monstrosum, commonly known as the giant white clover, is a variant of the common white clover. It is characterized by its larger leaves and more robust growth compared to the standard variety. This plant is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its trifoliate leaves are typically white or pale green, and it produces small, white or pink flowers. It is often used in landscaping and as a forage crop due to its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
