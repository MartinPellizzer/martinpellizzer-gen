    "intro": "Tessmannia densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered tessmannia, is an evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, providing a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal scrub. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a popular choice for native gardens and conservation efforts."
