    "intro": "Triodanis rupestris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seed heads similar to those of dandelions. It is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in conditions with limited water availability. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
