    "intro": "Trihesperus latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a milky sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
