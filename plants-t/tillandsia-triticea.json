    "intro": "Tillandsia triticea, commonly known as the grass tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, giving it its common name. Tillandsia triticea is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to thrive."
