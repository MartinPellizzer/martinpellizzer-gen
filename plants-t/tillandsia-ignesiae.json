    "intro": "Tillandsia ignesiae, commonly known as the Flame Tillandsia, is a unique air plant native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically red or orange, adding to its visual appeal. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered rare and is often cultivated in controlled environments."
