    "intro": "Tardiella, commonly known as the late-flowering heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces bell-shaped, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn, hence its common name. Tardiella thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
