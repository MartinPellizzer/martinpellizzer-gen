    "intro": "Taraxacum pollinense, commonly known as the Pollinense dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering head that produces a crown of white ray florets. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. It has a taproot system and is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. The seeds are dispersed by wind, with each seed attached to a parachute-like structure called a pappus."
