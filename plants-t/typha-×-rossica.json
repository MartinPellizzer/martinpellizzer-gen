    "intro": "Typha \u00d7 rossica, commonly known as the hybrid cattail, is a wetland plant that results from the natural cross between Typha angustifolia and Typha latifolia. It is characterized by its broad, sword-like leaves and a dense, cylindrical inflorescence that transitions from brown to yellow as it matures. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomes form extensive underground networks, allowing it to spread rapidly and dominate wetland habitats. Typha \u00d7 rossica plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
