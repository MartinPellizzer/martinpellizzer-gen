    "intro": "Talauma boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian talauma, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Bolivia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a strong, pleasant fragrance. Its leaves are elliptical,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Talauma boliviana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
