It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its compact, slow-growing form and dense foliage. The leaves are needle-like, dark green on top and whitish underneath, arranged in spirals along the branches. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the conifer family. This variety is adapted to moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded, cool environments."
