    "intro": "Tapiphyllum cinerascens var. richardsiae, commonly known as the Richards' ashwood, is a shrub native to the eastern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grayish branches and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, ash-like powder. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
