    "intro": "Tabernanthe, commonly known as the naked lady, is a genus of flowering plants in the Amaryllidaceae family. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their striking, showy flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and they often wither before the flowers emerge. Tabernanthe species are bulbous plants that store water in their underground bulbs, allowing them to survive dry periods. They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
