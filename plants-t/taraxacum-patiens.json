    "intro": "Taraxacum patiens, commonly known as the Patiens dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant features a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. Its flowers develop into a distinctive spherical seed head, which releases lightweight seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. Taraxacum patiens is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates."
