    "intro": "Tarchonanthus camphoratus, commonly known as wild camphor tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a tall, evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters in height, with a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. The plant is valued for its aromatic oils, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of camphor."
