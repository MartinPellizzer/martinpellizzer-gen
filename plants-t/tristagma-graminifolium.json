    "intro": "Tristagma graminifolium, commonly known as the slender tristagma, is a flowering plant species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its botanical features include narrow, linear leaves and tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Tristagma graminifolium is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
