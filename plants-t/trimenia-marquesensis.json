    "intro": "Trimenia marquesensis, commonly known as the Marquesas trimenia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Ocean, specifically the Marquesas Islands. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or white. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or lowland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
