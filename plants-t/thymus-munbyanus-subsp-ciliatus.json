    "intro": "Thymus munbyanus subsp. ciliatus, commonly known as the Munby thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features aromatic, narrow leaves covered in fine hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance and scent. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
