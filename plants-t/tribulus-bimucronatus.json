    "intro": "Tribulus bimucronatus, commonly known as the two-spined tribulus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive fruit capsules that split open to release seeds, a feature typical of many members of the Zygophyllaceae family. Its leaves are usually alternate and have a rough, hairy texture. Tribulus bimucronatus is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments."
