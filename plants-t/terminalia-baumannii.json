    "intro": "Terminalia baumannii, commonly known as the African apple or baobab, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and thick, corky bark that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The tree produces yellow-orange fruits that contain a starchy pulp and edible seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a distinctive serrated edge. Terminalia baumannii is valued for its fruit, timber, and traditional medicinal uses across various cultures."
