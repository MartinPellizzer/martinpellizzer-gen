    "intro": "Tomex tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly tomex, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with soft, hairy stems covered in dense white tomentum, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and also bear a similar woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish-white and appear in clusters, often blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
