It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its adaptability makes it a useful plant for erosion control and as a forage species for livestock."
