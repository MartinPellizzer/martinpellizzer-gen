    "intro": "Trapa jankovicii, commonly known as the Jankovi\u0107's water chestnut, is a rare aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Euryalaceae and is characterized by its floating leaves and spiny fruits. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its seeds are enclosed in a thick, bony shell, which helps protect them until they are ready to germinate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trapa jankovicii is considered a species of conservation concern."
