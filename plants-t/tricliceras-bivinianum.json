    "intro": "Tricliceras bivinianum, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare and exquisite flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking silver-green leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique morphology includes specialized roots that help it absorb moisture from the rocky terrain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
