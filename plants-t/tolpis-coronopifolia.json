    "intro": "Tolpis coronopifolia, commonly known as the crownleaf or golden crown, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine white hairs. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. Tolpis coronopifolia is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy or rocky soils in its native habitat."
