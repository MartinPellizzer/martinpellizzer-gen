    "intro": "Tragia lobata, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are usually lobed and adapted to reduce water loss, making it well-suited for harsh environments. Tragia lobata is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in conditions with limited water availability."
