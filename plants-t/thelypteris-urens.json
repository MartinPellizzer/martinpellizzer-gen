    "intro": "Thelypteris urens, commonly known as the running shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a slender, often arching appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
