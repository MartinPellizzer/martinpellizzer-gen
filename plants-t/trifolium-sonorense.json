    "intro": "Trifolium sonorense, commonly known as the Sonoran clover, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Trifolium sonorense plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
