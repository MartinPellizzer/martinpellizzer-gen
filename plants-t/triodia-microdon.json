    "intro": "Triodia microdon, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and is often found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife. Triodia microdon is well adapted to drought and can survive in nutrient-poor soils."
