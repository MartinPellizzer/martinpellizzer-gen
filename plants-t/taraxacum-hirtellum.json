    "intro": "Taraxacum hirtellum, commonly known as the hairy dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other dandelion species. The plant produces a single, yellow composite flower head that develops into a white, spherical seed head known as a pappus. It is native to North America and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Taraxacum hirtellum is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other sunny areas where it can spread easily through its wind-dispersed seeds."
