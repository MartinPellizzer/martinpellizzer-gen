    "intro": "Triglochin narbonensis, commonly known as the Narbonne's spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, pond margins, and damp meadows. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Triglochin narbonensis is adapted to fluctuating water levels and is often found in areas with poor drainage."
