    "intro": "Thevetia calophylla, commonly known as the yellow false jasmine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain toxic seeds, which can be harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed soils. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though care must be taken due to its poisonous properties."
