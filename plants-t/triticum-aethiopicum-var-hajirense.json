    "intro": "Triticum aethiopicum var. hajirense, commonly known as the Ethiopian wheat, is a wild wheat species native to Ethiopia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool and temperate climates. Its grains are small and hard, with a high protein content. This variety is of interest to researchers for its potential in genetic diversity and breeding programs for improved wheat varieties."
