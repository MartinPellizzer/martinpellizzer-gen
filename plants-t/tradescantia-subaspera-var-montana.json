    "intro": "Tradescantia subaspera var. montana, commonly known as mountain spiderwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It features lance-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface, which give it its scientific name \"subaspera,\" meaning \"subtle roughness.\" The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a hardy and low-maintenance ornamental plant. Its adaptability and attractive appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings."
