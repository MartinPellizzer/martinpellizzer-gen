    "intro": "Trichosanthes matsudae, commonly known as the Japanese bitter melon, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is a vine that produces elongated, ribbed fruits with a distinct bitter taste. The plant is native to East Asia and is often cultivated for its edible fruits, though they are typically used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The fruit develops from the female flowers and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters."
