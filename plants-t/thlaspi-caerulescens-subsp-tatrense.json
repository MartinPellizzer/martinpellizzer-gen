    "intro": "Thlaspi caerulescens subsp. tatrense, commonly known as the Tatran Alpine Cabbage, is a rare and specialized plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and bluish-gray foliage, which helps it withstand harsh mountain conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a compact inflorescence, typical of the Brassicaceae family. It thrives in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
