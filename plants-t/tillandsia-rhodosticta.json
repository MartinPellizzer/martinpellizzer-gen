    "intro": "Tillandsia rhodosticta, commonly known as the red-streaked air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia rhodosticta produces striking inflorescences with vivid red or orange bracts, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity."
