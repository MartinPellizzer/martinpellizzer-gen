    "intro": "Trieenea frigida, commonly known as the frosty fern, is a rare and cold-tolerant plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that thrive in cool, moist environments. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, typical of its fern classification, and prefers shaded, well-drained soil. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Trieenea frigida is considered a vulnerable species."
