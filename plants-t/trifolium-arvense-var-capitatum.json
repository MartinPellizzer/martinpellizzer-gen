    "intro": "Trifolium arvense var. capitatum, commonly known as the clustered clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, trifoliate leaves, which are typically bright green and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often arranged in compact heads. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in some agricultural contexts for soil stabilization."
