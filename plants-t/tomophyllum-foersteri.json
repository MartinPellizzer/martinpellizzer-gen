    "intro": "Tomophyllum foersteri, commonly known as the Foerster's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with elongated, pale green or white petals that resemble translucent veils. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Tomophyllum foersteri is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
