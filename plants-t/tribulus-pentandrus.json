    "intro": "Tribulus pentandrus, commonly known as the caltrop, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb that produces small, spiny fruits containing four seeds. The plant is characterized by its prickly leaves and stems, which help it to deter herbivores. Its flowers are typically yellow and appear in clusters, and it thrives in dry, disturbed soils. Tribulus pentandrus has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
