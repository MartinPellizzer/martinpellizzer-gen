    "intro": "Taraxacum deludens, commonly known as the deceptive dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk flowers, which are typically yellow in color. This species is native to parts of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its botanical features make it similar to other dandelion species, but it can be distinguished by specific morphological traits."
