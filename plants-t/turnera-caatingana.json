    "intro": "Turnera caatingana, commonly known as the caatinga turnera, is a shrub native to the semi-arid regions of northeastern Brazil. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in the dry forest ecosystems. Turnera caatingana is adapted to withstand drought and plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat."
