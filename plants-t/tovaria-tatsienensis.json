    "intro": "Tovaria tatsienensis, commonly known as the Yunnan evergreen fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Tovariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in dense forests at high altitudes. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Tovaria tatsienensis is considered vulnerable and requires protection."
