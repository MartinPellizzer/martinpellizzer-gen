    "intro": "Tetragonolobus conjugatus subsp. guttatus, commonly known as the glossy bupleurum, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features upright, branched stems that are often covered in a dense layer of short, glandular hairs. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and have a distinctive glossy sheen due to their waxy surface. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense panicles, and typically have four petals with a blue to purple coloration. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance through its succulent-like leaves and deep root system."
