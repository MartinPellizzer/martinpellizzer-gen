    "intro": "Triticum villosum, commonly known as wild wheat, is a grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing florets that mature into grains. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. While not widely cultivated, it has been studied for its potential in genetic research due to its unique traits."
