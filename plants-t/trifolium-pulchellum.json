    "intro": "Trifolium pulchellum, commonly known as the showy clover, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Trifolium pulchellum is often found in open woodlands and meadows, thriving in well-drained soils. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
