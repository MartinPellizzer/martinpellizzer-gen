    "intro": "Thelypteris ciliata, commonly known as the silky water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered with soft, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Thelypteris ciliata has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a thin, membranous covering."
