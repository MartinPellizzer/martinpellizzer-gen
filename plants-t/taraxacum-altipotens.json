    "intro": "Taraxacum altipotens, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy rosettes. The plant produces a distinctive yellow flower that develops into a white, hairy pappus for wind dispersal of its seeds. Its leaves are typically basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Taraxacum altipotens is adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous regions."
