    "intro": "Triumfetta parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered triumfetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by three-winged, papery fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. Triumfetta parviflora is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
