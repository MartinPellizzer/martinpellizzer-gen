    "intro": "Tillandsia umbellata, commonly known as the Umbrella Tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup-like structure to collect rainwater. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces. It produces striking, showy inflorescences with numerous small, white or pale pink flowers. This species is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
