It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically leathery and smooth to the touch. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori. Thelypteris laevis thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
