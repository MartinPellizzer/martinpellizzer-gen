    "intro": "Trifolium occidentale, commonly known as western clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, known as trusses. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. Trifolium occidentale is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
