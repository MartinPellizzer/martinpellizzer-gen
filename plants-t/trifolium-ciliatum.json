    "intro": "Trifolium ciliatum, commonly known as the hairy clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with fine hairs along the edges. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Trifolium ciliatum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
