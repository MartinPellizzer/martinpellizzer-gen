It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. Its roots are known for their ability to produce a gelatinous substance, which has been historically used in traditional medicine. This species is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
