    "intro": "Trifolium obvallatum, commonly known as the heartleaf clover, is a species of legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets that are often heart-shaped at the base. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Trifolium obvallatum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for agricultural use."
