    "intro": "Thelypteris blumei, commonly known as the Blume's water fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in wet habitats. Thelypteris blumei is valued not only for its ornamental appearance but also for its ecological role in maintaining soil stability in humid regions."
