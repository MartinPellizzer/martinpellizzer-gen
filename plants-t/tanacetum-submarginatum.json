    "intro": "Tanacetum submarginatum, commonly known as the common tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small yellow to orange flower heads. The plant produces a strong, aromatic scent due to the presence of volatile compounds such as thujone and camphor. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. Tanacetum submarginatum has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a pest repellent, though its toxic properties require caution in handling."
