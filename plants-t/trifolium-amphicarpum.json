    "intro": "Trifolium amphicarpum, commonly known as the red clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in temperate climates. Trifolium amphicarpum is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It produces small, purple or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, making it a common sight in meadows and grasslands."
