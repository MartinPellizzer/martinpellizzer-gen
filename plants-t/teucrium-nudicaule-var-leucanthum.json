    "intro": "Teucrium nudicaule var. leucanthum, commonly known as the white-flowered germander, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
