    "intro": "Tillandsia \u00d7 cornissaensis, commonly known as the Corn Island air plant, is a hybrid epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water and nutrients from the environment. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil for growth. Its foliage is typically gray-green with a waxy texture, and it produces striking violet or purple flowers. This species is popular among air plant enthusiasts due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
