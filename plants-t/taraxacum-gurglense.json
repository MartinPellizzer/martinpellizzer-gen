    "intro": "Taraxacum gurglense, commonly known as the Gurglens dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a parachute-like structure called a pappus, allowing its seeds to be carried by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Due to its unique habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
