    "intro": "Thalictrum crenatum, commonly known as the fernleaf meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, feathery leaves that resemble ferns, with a basal rosette structure and slender, branching stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Thalictrum crenatum is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and is often used in native plant landscaping."
