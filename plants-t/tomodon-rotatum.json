    "intro": "Tomodon rotatum, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Ptilidiaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, still water environments. The plant is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. Tomodon rotatum has a simple thallus structure with a distinct, often ribbon-like shape. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and contributing to nutrient cycling."
