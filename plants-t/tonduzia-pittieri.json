    "intro": "Tonduzia pittieri, commonly known as the Pittier's tonduzia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically with a bluish-green hue. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range."
