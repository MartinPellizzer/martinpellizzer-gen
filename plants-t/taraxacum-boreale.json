    "intro": "Taraxacum boreale, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to cold climates in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower. The plant thrives in alpine and subarctic regions, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its flowers produce small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its wide distribution. Taraxacum boreale is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including low temperatures and strong sunlight."
