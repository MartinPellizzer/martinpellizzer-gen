    "intro": "Trifolium pratense var. hirsutum, commonly known as hairy red clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being oval to lance-shaped with a slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in dense clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Hairy red clover is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it an important plant in sustainable agriculture."
