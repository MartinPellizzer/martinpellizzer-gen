    "intro": "Triaspis macropteron f. brevistipulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved triaspis, is a variant of the triaspis plant characterized by its shorter, narrower leaves compared to the typical form. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant typically features a slender, upright stem with finely divided leaves that give it a delicate appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in umbels, a common floral arrangement in the Apiaceae family. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its refined foliage."
