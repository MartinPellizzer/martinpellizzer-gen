    "intro": "Thalictrum latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are compound and arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces showy, clustered yellow flowers in early spring, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Thalictrum latifolium is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
