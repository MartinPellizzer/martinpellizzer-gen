    "intro": "Tulipa hungarica, commonly known as the Hungarian tulip, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Carpathian Basin. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and a compact growth habit, making it well-suited for rock gardens or containers. It requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Tulipa hungarica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
