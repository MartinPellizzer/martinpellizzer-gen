    "intro": "Tripolium pannonicum, commonly known as the Pannonian sand thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Pannonian Basin. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and riverbanks. It has small, alternate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces achenes as its fruit type. Tripolium pannonicum is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils through its extensive root system."
