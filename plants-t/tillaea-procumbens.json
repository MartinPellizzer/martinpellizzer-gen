    "intro": "Tillaea procumbens, commonly known as the sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It has a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Tillaea procumbens plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and is often found in coastal and desert environments."
