    "intro": "Tectaria devexa var. novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea tectaria, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a rugged, serrated appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth or on rocky substrates. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage."
