    "intro": "Taraxacum aequilobum, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem that supports its flowering structure, and its seeds are dispersed by wind via a feathery pappus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, forest edges, and along streams. Botanically, it is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads."
