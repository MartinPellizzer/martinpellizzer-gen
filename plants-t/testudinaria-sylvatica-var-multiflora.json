    "intro": "Testudinaria sylvatica var. multiflora, commonly known as the woodland tortoise plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It features a basal rosette of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its slow growth and ornamental foliage make it a desirable addition to rock gardens and shaded borders."
