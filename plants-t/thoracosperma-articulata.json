    "intro": "Thoracosperma articulata, commonly known as the mangrove apple or white mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal areas, particularly in brackish or saline wetlands. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, elliptical leaves with a waxy coating. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces fleshy, red or yellow berries that are an important food source for various birds and mammals. The plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and filtering pollutants from water."
