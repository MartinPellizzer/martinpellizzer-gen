    "intro": "Tubella solomonii, commonly known as Solomon's tubella, is a rare and unique species of sea sponge found in the deep waters of the Atlantic Ocean. It belongs to the family Tubellidae and is characterized by its delicate, branching structure and translucent body. This sponge lacks a true skeleton and instead relies on a gelatinous mesohyl for structural support. It is typically found in deep-sea environments, often attached to the seafloor or other substrates. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is of great interest to marine biologists and conservationists."
