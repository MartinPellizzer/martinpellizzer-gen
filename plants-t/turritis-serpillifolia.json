    "intro": "Turritis serpillifolia, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with dark green, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with a deep root system and succulent leaves that store water. Turritis serpillifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
