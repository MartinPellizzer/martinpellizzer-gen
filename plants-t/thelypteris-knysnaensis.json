    "intro": "Thelypteris knysnaensis, commonly known as Knysna shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the formation of dense colonies. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a lush, fern-like appearance."
