    "intro": "Taraxacum obovatum f. laceratum, commonly known as the frayed dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that give it a frayed appearance. The plant produces a single, tall, yellow flower head that blooms in the spring and early summer. It is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. This variant is notable for its unique leaf morphology and is often confused with other dandelion species."
