    "intro": "Tragus racemosus var. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive tragus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often mistaken for other similar species. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as scrublands and coastal areas. Due to its deceptive appearance, it can be challenging to distinguish from related species without close examination."
