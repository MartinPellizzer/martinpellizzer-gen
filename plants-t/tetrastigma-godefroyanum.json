    "intro": "Tetrastigma godefroyanum, commonly known as the Godefroy's cross-vine, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the grape family, Vitaceae, and is characterized by its tendrils that help it climb and spread along supports. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. Its leaves are compound, typically with three to five leaflets, and are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
