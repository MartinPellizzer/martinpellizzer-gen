    "intro": "Trifolium bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three leaflets, and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in areas with well-drained soil. It is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in regions with a Mediterranean climate. Trifolium bolanderi is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
