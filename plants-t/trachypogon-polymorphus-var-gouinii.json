It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelets. It typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. This variant is distinguished by its morphological variations compared to the typical form of Trachypogon polymorphus."
