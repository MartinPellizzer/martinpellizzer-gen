    "intro": "Trichilia tomentosa, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety gray bark and elliptical, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. Its leaves and bark have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their astringent and antispasmodic properties. The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and carving."
