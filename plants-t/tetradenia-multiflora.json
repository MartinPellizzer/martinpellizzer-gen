    "intro": "Tetradenia multiflora, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of eastern and southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, featuring woody stems and lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom throughout the year in coastal climates. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, and it plays an important role in providing nectar in its native habitat. The plant is well adapted to salty air and can tolerate light coastal winds, making it a hardy and resilient species."
