    "intro": "Tragopogon brevirostris subsp. longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved goat's beard, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to western North America, this subspecies thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. The plant produces a distinctive seed head with bristly pappus that aids in wind dispersal. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
