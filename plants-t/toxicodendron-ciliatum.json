    "intro": "Toxicodendron ciliatum, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in open woodlands. However, it contains urushiol, a toxic resin that can cause skin irritation in humans."
