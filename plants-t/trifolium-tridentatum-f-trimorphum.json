It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, each leaflet having a unique shape that contributes to its trimorphum designation. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in meadows and along roadsides, where it plays a role in soil stabilization. Its small white or pink flowers bloom in spring, adding ornamental value to the landscape."
