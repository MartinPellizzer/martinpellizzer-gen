It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, branched stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
