    "intro": "Triticum fastuosum, commonly known as the showy wheat or decorative wheat, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and showy, feathery inflorescence. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that are typically pale green to bluish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in open fields or along roadsides. While not a staple food crop, it is occasionally cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal."
