    "intro": "Tragacantha strigulosa, commonly known as the hairy tragacanth, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, trifoliate leaves, and small yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It produces a gum resin, similar to tragacanth, which has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties. The hairy texture of its stems and leaves gives it its common name and helps it retain moisture in dry conditions."
