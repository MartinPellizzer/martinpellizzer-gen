    "intro": "Terminalia bipleura, commonly known as the two-winged terminalia, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its distinctive two-winged fruits, which are typically dispersed by wind. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture, while the bark is thick and fissured. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and forest edges. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
