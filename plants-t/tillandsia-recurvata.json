    "intro": "Tillandsia recurvata, commonly known as the silver vulture orchid, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant has short, stiff leaves that form a rosette, and it produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with bright yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires good air circulation. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance needs, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
