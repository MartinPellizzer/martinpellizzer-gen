    "intro": "Trifolium retusum, commonly known as the hairy clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three rounded leaflets with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Trifolium retusum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological and agricultural contexts."
