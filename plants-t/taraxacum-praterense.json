    "intro": "Taraxacum praterense, commonly known as the meadow dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a yellow flowering head that develops into a white, fluffy pappus for seed dispersal. Native to Europe, it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is perennial, with a deep taproot that allows it to survive in various environmental conditions. Its flowers bloom in spring and early summer, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
