    "intro": "Tephrosia virginiana var. holosericea, commonly known as the silky tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet having a soft, silky texture due to the dense covering of fine hairs. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
