    "intro": "Trachelospermum jasminoides subsp. foetidum, commonly known as the stinking jasmine, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a woody vine that produces small, fragrant white flowers, although the scent is often described as unpleasant or foul. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value despite its strong odor. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions. The subspecies is closely related to the more popular Trachelospermum jasminoides, but its distinctive smell sets it apart."
