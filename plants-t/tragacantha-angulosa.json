    "intro": "Tragacantha angulosa, commonly known as angular tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its angular, ribbed stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its latex, which is milky and sticky, has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural gum. Tragacantha angulosa thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrublands and wastelands."
