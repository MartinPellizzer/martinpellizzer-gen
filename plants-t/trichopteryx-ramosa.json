    "intro": "Trichopteryx ramosa, commonly known as the branched broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its branching stem and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are often overlooked due to its inconspicuous appearance. It is found in various regions of Europe and Asia, typically growing in dry, open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
