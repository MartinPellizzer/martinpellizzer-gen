    "intro": "Thelypteris macroptera, commonly known as the broad-leafed shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its fronds are evergreen, and it produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. Thelypteris macroptera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in landscaping in regions with a temperate climate."
