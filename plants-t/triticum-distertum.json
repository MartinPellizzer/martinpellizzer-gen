    "intro": "Triticum distertum, commonly known as the slender wheat or wild wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish florets. Triticum distertum is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. It is considered a minor wild relative of cultivated wheat, with potential interest in genetic research for improving wheat varieties."
