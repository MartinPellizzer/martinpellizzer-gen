    "intro": "Typha martini, commonly known as the narrowleaf cattail, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically brown or yellowish in color. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous stem, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Typha martini thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its structure provides important habitat for various aquatic organisms and birds."
