    "intro": "Thevenotia scabra, commonly known as the rough sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, green leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, four-petaled flowers during the spring and early summer. Its succulent leaves help it store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Thevenotia scabra is often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
