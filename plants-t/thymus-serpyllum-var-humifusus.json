It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, fragrant leaves that emit a minty aroma when crushed. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and ground covers. Its hardy nature allows it to withstand frost and drought, contributing to its popularity in horticulture."
