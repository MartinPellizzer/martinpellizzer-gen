    "intro": "Tristellateia ambongensis, commonly known as the Ambongensis starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
