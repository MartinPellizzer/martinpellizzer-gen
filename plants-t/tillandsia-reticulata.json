    "intro": "Tillandsia reticulata, commonly known as the silver vase bromeliad, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding cup at the center. The leaves are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence that gives the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity. This epiphytic plant is popular among bromeliad enthusiasts for its unique aesthetic and low maintenance requirements."
