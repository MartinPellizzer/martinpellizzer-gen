    "intro": "Trigonella spruneriana f. transcaspica, commonly known as the Transcaspian fenugreek, is a rare and lesser-known botanical variant of the fenugreek genus. It is native to Central Asia, particularly found in regions spanning Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. This plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
