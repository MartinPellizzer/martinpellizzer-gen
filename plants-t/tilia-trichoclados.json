    "intro": "Tilia trichoclados, commonly known as the woolly linden, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, grayish bark and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, winged fruits. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. The woolly linden is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
