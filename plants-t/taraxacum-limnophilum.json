    "intro": "Taraxacum limnophilum, commonly known as the marsh dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance in wetland ecosystems. The plant is also noted for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, making it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic plant communities."
