    "intro": "Taraxacum musteum, commonly known as the meadow dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The flower head develops into a composite structure of tiny, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a fluffy pappus. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. This plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects."
