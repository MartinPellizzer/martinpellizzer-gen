    "intro": "Tectaria gigantea, commonly known as the giant tectaria, is a large fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its expansive, lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in lowland forests. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Tectaria gigantea plays a significant role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity."
