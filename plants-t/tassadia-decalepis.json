    "intro": "Tassadia decalepis, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has palmate leaves that are often hairy, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Tassadia decalepis is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small organisms."
