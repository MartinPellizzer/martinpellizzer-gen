    "intro": "Tilia aenobarba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lime, is a species of flowering tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are narrower and more pointed than those of other lime species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, round fruits. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open forests. Tilia aenobarba is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
