It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in pairs, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its gum content."
