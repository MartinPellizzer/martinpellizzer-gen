It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and produces small, pink or purple flowers in spikes. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Trifolium majus is also used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
