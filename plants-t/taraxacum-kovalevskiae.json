    "intro": "Taraxacum kovalevskiae, commonly known as the Kovalevskaya dandelion, is a rare and endangered species of flowering plant native to the Russian Far East. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant is adapted to grow in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Its small, wind-dispersed seeds contribute to its limited distribution and ecological specificity. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it faces significant conservation challenges."
