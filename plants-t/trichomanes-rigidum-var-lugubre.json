    "intro": "Trichomanes rigidum var. lugubre, commonly known as the mournful holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are often dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
