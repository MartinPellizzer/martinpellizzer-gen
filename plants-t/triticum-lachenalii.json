    "intro": "Triticum lachenalii, commonly known as the Lachenal's wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wheat native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky environments and is adapted to cold and arid conditions. Its grains are small and have a high protein content, making it potentially valuable for modern agriculture. However, it is not widely cultivated and remains a subject of botanical and genetic study."
