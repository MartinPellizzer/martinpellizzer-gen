    "intro": "Taeniopsis scolopendrina, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to absorb moisture from the air. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Taeniopsis scolopendrina is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
