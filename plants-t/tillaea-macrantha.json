    "intro": "Tillaea macrantha, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a rosette of dense, fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Tillaea macrantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous habitats."
