    "intro": "Tofieldia pusilla subsp. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf tofieldia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant is often found in moist, acidic soils in open habitats such as bogs, swamps, and wet meadows. It blooms from late spring to early summer and is an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its compact size and unique floral structure make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species within its habitat."
