    "intro": "Tillandsia oranensis, commonly known as the Orange Island air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Caribbean. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture from the air. It produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
