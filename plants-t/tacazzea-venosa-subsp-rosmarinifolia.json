    "intro": "Tacazzea venosa subsp. rosmarinifolia, commonly known as the Rosmarinus-like tacazzea, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, almost aromatic appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
