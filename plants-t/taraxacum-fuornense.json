    "intro": "Taraxacum fuornense, commonly known as the Fuorn dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, upright stem topped with a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed ball. It thrives in rocky and grassy habitats at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
