    "intro": "Tilia cordata var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves, which are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. These flowers are an important nectar source for bees and other pollinators. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age."
