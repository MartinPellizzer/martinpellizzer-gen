    "intro": "Trichomanes gracile, commonly known as the slender moonwort, is a small, delicate fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that are often covered in tiny, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Trichomanes gracile is a rare and often overlooked species due to its diminutive size and cryptic habitat."
