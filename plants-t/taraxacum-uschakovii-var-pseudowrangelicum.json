    "intro": "Taraxacum uschakovii var. pseudowrangelicum, commonly known as the Wrangel Island dandelion, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily on Wrangel Island in the Arctic. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of basal leaves and a yellow composite flower head. The plant exhibits adaptations to cold climates, including a short growing season and frost-resistant physiology. Its flowers are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and flies, contributing to its reproductive success. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
