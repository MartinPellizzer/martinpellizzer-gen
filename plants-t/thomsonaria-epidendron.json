    "intro": "Thomsonaria epidendron, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter. Native to the tropical regions of Africa, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in less-than-ideal conditions. The plant's unique structure and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
