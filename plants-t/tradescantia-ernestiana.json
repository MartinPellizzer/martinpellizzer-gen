    "intro": "Tradescantia ernestiana, commonly known as Ernestiana spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that features narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing vivid pink or purple flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense mats that suppress weeds."
