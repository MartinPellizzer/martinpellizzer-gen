    "intro": "Triticum turgidum subsp. carthlicum, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild wheat species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are encased in tough, straw-like husks, and the plant is often found growing in disturbed soils or along field margins. Despite its wild nature, it has been studied for its potential in breeding programs to improve cultivated wheat varieties."
