    "intro": "Thladiantha hookeri f. trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leaf bittersweet, is a variant of the bittersweet vine native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces yellow-orange berries that mature in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
