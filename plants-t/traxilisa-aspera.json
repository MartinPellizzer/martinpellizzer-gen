It is characterized by its woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
