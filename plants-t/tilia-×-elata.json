    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 elata, commonly known as the European mountain ash or the common ash, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn and its clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that appear in early summer. The tree produces small, round berries that are typically dispersed by birds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full sun to partial shade. Tilia \u00d7 elata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to provide shade and habitat for wildlife."
