    "intro": "Tragacantha baibutensis, commonly known as the Baibut shrub, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it access underground water sources. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural gum."
