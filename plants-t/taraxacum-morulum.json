    "intro": "Taraxacum morulum, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other composite flowers. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and lance-shaped, with a central stem that bears a single, yellowish flower head. Its flowers develop into a characteristic spherical seed head, which releases seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. Taraxacum morulum is adapted to grow in rocky or alpine soils, often at high altitudes where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
