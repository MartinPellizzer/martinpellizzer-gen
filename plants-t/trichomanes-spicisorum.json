    "intro": "Trichomanes spicisorum, commonly known as the spicate huperbole, is a fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes spicisorum plays a role in maintaining the biodiversity of its native habitats by providing microhabitats for various invertebrates."
