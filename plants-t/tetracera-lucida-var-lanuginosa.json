    "intro": "Tetracera lucida var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the silky tetracera, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its hairy, soft foliage that gives it its varietal name \"lanuginosa,\" meaning woolly. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for study in tropical botany and horticulture."
