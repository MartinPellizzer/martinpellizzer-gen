    "intro": "Tunica thessala, commonly known as the Mediterranean thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a robust root system and is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Tunica thessala is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
