    "intro": "Taraxacum albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The flower head consists of numerous small, petal-less florets that eventually develop into fluffy, white seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. This plant is native to southern Europe and is often found in dry, disturbed soils in meadows and grasslands. It is a perennial herb that blooms from spring to early summer."
