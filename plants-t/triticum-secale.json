    "intro": "Triticum secale, commonly known as rye, is a cereal grain native to Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow leaves. The plant produces dense spikes of small, two-lobed flowers that develop into grains. Rye is known for its hardiness, thriving in colder climates and poor soils. Its botanical features make it a valuable crop for both food and forage."
