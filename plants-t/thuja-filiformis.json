    "intro": "Thuja filiformis, commonly known as the Alberta spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Canada. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its dense, scale-like foliage that is dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant has small, rounded cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its slow growth rate and hardiness make it suitable for colder climates."
