    "intro": "Thymus montanus var. amplificatus, commonly known as the broadleaf thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, aromatic leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers during the spring and early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and borders. Its foliage is noted for its strong thyme scent and its ability to tolerate drought conditions."
