It features compact, woody stems and small, gray-green leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils. Thymus carpathicus is often used in herbal medicine and as a culinary herb, similar to other thyme species."
