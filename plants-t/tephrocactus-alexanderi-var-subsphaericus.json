    "intro": "Tephrocactus alexanderi var. subsphaericus, commonly known as the Alexander's globose cactus, is a rare and compact cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It features a spherical or nearly spherical stem that is typically covered in short, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
