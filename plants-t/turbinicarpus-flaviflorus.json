It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white to grayish woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
