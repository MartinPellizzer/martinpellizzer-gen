    "intro": "Thelypteris augescens var. lindheimeri, commonly known as Lindheimer's holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are often clustered at the base, forming a dense, compact growth habit."
