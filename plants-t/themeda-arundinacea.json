    "intro": "Themeda arundinacea, commonly known as kangaroo grass, is a perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Kangaroo grass is well adapted to dry, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
