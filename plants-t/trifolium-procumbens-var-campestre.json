    "intro": "Trifolium procumbens var. campestre, commonly known as creeping clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to lance-shaped leaflets, often with a pale midrib. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in nitrogen fixation in soil."
