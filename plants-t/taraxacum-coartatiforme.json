    "intro": "Taraxacum coartatiforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It produces a capsule that disperses its seeds via the wind, a common adaptation in the Asteraceae family. The species is often mistaken for other dandelion species due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its distinctive leaf shape and smaller flower head."
