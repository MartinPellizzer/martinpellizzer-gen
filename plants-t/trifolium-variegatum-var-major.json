    "intro": "Trifolium variegatum var. major, commonly known as the variable clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a distinct white or pale marking on the central leaflet. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
