    "intro": "Tectaria jardinii, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, tropical environments. Its rhizomes are thick and covered with a dense layer of root hairs, which help it absorb moisture from the air. Tectaria jardinii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
