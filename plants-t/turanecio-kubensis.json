    "intro": "Turanecio kubensis, commonly known as the Kuben mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet petals and is often found growing in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant typically reaches a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and blooms during the cooler months of the year. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Turanecio kubensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
