    "intro": "Trollius uncinatus, commonly known as the hooked globeflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its showy, yellow, globe-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmate leaves with lobed segments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its scientific name reflects the hooked bracts that surround the flower, a distinctive botanical feature. Trollius uncinatus is part of the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many showy and sometimes toxic plants."
