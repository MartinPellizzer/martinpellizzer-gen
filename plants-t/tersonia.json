    "intro": "Tersonia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Tersonia is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
