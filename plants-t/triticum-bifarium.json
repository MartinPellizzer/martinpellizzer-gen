    "intro": "Triticum bifarium, commonly known as the two-rowed wheat, is a grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender stalks and dense, spike-like inflorescence with two rows of spikelets. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into grains, which are the edible part harvested for food. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a bluish-green hue, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. Triticum bifarium is primarily cultivated for its grain, which is used in baking and brewing."
