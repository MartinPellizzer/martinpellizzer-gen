    "intro": "Trisetum heteronymum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and forms dense tussocks, often found in moist or wetland habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Trisetum heteronymum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
