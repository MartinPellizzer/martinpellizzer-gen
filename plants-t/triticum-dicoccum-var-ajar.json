    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum var. ajar, commonly known as Ajar spelt, is a variety of hulled wheat native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, hard grains enclosed in a tough, inedible hull. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are rich in protein and minerals, making it a valuable crop for traditional and organic farming. The botanical features of Ajar spelt contribute to its resilience in harsh climates and its unique nutritional profile."
