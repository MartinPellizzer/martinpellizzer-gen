    "intro": "Thymus pallidus var. camphoratus, commonly known as the camphor thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features small, gray-green leaves with a distinctive camphor-like aroma, which is due to the presence of essential oils. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its medicinal properties have historically been valued for their antiseptic and aromatic qualities."
