    "intro": "Tetrapogon cenchriformis, commonly known as the burr grass, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, bristly seed heads that resemble a burr, which aid in seed dispersal. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, yellowish flowers. Tetrapogon cenchriformis is adapted to withstand drought and is an important component of the local flora in its native habitat."
