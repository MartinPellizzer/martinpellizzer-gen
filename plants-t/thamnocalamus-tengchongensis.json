    "intro": "Thamnocalamus tengchongensis, commonly known as the Tengchong bamboo, is a species native to China, particularly in Yunnan Province. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender culms and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to the structural integrity of the plant. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
