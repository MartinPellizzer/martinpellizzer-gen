    "intro": "Trigonella polyceratia f. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate fenugreek, is a low-growing, herbaceous annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by flat, triangular pods containing several seeds. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate high temperatures and limited water. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological studies of drought-resistant flora."
