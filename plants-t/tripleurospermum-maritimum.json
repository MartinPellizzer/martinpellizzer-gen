    "intro": "Tripleurospermum maritimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple ray florets and yellow disk flowers, which bloom in summer. The plant has silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. Its resilience to maritime conditions makes it a valuable plant for coastal restoration projects."
