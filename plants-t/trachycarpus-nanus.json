    "intro": "Trachycarpus nanus, commonly known as the dwarf windmill palm, is a small, cold-hardy palm native to southern China. It features a slender, unbranched trunk with a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a tropical appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark blue, edible fruits. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and is well-suited for container growing. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique and hardy addition to subtropical and temperate landscapes."
