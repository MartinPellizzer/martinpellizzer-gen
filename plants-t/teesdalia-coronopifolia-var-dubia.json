    "intro": "Teesdalia coronopifolia var. dubia, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in arid and rocky environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that release wind-dispersed seeds. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to drought and poor soil conditions."
