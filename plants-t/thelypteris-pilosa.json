    "intro": "Thelypteris pilosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are often thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Thelypteris pilosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
