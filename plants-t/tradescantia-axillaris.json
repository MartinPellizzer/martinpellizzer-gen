    "intro": "Tradescantia axillaris, commonly known as the silver spiderwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or lavender. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a silvery-blue hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens. This plant is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local pollinator populations."
