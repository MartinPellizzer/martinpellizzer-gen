    "intro": "Tecoma tenuiflora, commonly known as the narrow-flower trumpet bush, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and clusters of trumpet-shaped, yellow to orange flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, elongated fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Tecoma tenuiflora thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and showy flowers make it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
