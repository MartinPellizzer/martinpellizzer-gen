    "intro": "Taraxacum subgentiliforme, commonly known as the slender dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, bluish-green leaves and a tall, hollow stem that bears a single flower head. The flowers are typically yellow and develop into a pappus-equipped seed head, which aids in wind dispersal. This species is native to southern Europe and is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. It exhibits the typical morphology of the genus Taraxacum, with a taproot and a distinctive composite flower structure."
