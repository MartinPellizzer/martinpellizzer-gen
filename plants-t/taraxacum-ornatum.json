    "intro": "Taraxacum ornatum, commonly known as the showy dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, ridged stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. Its flowers develop into spherical seed heads with white, feathery seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Taraxacum ornatum is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands."
