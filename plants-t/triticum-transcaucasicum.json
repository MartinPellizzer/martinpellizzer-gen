    "intro": "Triticum transcaucasicum, commonly known as the Transcaucasian wheat, is a species of wild wheat native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, tan-colored grains that are typically harvested for their potential in breeding programs. It is closely related to common wheat and has been studied for its genetic diversity and adaptability to various environmental conditions. Due to its resilience, it is considered an important resource for agricultural research and crop improvement."
