It is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) leaves and slender, tufted inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and riverbanks. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brown florets. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
