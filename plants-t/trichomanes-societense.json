    "intro": "Trichomanes societense, commonly known as the Socotra spleenwort, is a rare and ancient fern native to the island of Socotra. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
