    "intro": "Tephrosia elongata var. glabra, commonly known as smooth slender tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with five petals. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or pea family, and is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobia bacteria. The smooth, glabrous (hairless) leaves of this variety distinguish it from other variants of Tephrosia elongata."
