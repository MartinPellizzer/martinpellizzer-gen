    "intro": "Thelypteris amboinensis, commonly known as the Amboina shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that often form a shield-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, fibrous layer, which helps it anchor in soil and retain moisture. Thelypteris amboinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its unique foliage."
