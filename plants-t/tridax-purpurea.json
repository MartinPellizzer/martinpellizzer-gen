    "intro": "Tridax purpurea, commonly known as the purple dandelion, is an annual flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces a distinctive seed head that releases tiny seeds with parachute-like structures. Tridax purpurea is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in agricultural and urban areas."
