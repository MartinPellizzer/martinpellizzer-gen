    "intro": "Tropaeolum macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant jewelweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. Its tubular stems are succulent and can grow quite long, allowing it to spread along the ground or climb. Tropaeolum macrophyllum is often found in moist, shady environments, such as forest floors or stream banks."
