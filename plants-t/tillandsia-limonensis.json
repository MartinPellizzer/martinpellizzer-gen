    "intro": "Tillandsia limonensis, commonly known as the lemon-scented air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees in humid environments. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, adding a vibrant touch to its appearance. Tillandsia limonensis is well adapted to its environment, relying on air and rain for nourishment rather than soil."
