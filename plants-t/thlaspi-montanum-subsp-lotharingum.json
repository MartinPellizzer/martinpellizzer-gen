    "intro": "Thlaspi montanum subsp. lotharingum, commonly known as the Alpine cabbages, is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and rosette-forming structure. It typically features basal leaves that are lobed or toothed, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its often harsh, alpine or rocky habitat. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions across Europe. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ornamental plant."
