    "intro": "Thalictrum orientale, commonly known as the eastern meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear compound leaves with finely divided, fern-like lobes. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in panicle inflorescences. Its root system consists of fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and absorb nutrients. Thalictrum orientale is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, shady conditions."
