    "intro": "Tragacantha ruprechtii, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems, lance-shaped leaves, and yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a gum resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures. Tragacantha ruprechtii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert species."
