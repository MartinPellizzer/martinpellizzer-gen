    "intro": "Trisetum spicatum var. phleoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it a desirable ornamental plant. The plant typically grows in moist to mesic environments, such as meadows and woodland edges. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. It is valued for its fine texture and ability to form dense, low-growing sods."
