    "intro": "Tanacetum suaveolens, commonly known as sweet yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems and finely divided, aromatic leaves that emit a subtle, pleasant scent. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its essential oils, rich in compounds like thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its medicinal and aromatic properties. Tanacetum suaveolens is often used in herbal remedies and as a garden plant for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
