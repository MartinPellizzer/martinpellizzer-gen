    "intro": "Thelypteris telefominica, commonly known as the Bornean shield fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round foliage in its native range."
