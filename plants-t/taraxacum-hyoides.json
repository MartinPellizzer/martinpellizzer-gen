    "intro": "Taraxacum hyoides, commonly known as the hyoid dandelion, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces a hollow, wind-dispersed seed stem. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in early spring, followed by the characteristic fluffy seeds. Taraxacum hyoides is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils."
