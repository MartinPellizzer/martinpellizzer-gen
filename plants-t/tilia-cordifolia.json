    "intro": "Tilia cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The tree produces small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. These flowers are an important nectar source for bees and other pollinators. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the wood is light, soft, and used in various crafts."
