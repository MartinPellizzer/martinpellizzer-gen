    "intro": "Triainolepis arcuata, commonly known as the curved-leaf fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, arcuate (curved) fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its fronds are usually pinnately compound, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
