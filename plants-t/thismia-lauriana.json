    "intro": "Thismia lauriana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thismiaceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungi for nutrients. The plant produces small, white, flower-like structures that resemble orchids, though they are not true flowers. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on decaying wood or in leaf litter. Due to its elusive nature and habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
