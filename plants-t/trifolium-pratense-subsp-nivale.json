    "intro": "Trifolium pratense subsp. nivale, commonly known as snow clover, is a cool-season perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is known for its ability to thrive in shaded conditions. Snow clover is also valued for its role in nitrogen fixation, benefiting the surrounding ecosystem."
