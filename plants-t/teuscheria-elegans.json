    "intro": "Teuscheria elegans, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and small, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Teuscheria elegans is highly valued in botanical research and conservation efforts."
