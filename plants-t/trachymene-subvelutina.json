It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Trachymene subvelutina is often found in the understorey of dense vegetation, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
