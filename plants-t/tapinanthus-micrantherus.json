    "intro": "Tapinanthus micrantherus, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from host plants. It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, funnel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often attaching itself to trees or shrubs. Its leaves are alternate and heart-shaped, while its flowers are usually pale yellow or white. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
