    "intro": "Triticum compactum var. copticum, commonly known as Coptic wheat, is a variety of wheat that is primarily cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stature compared to other wheat species, which makes it more resilient to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, hard grains that are typically used in traditional baking and brewing practices. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a spikelet structure typical of the Poaceae family. This variety is also valued for its adaptability to poor soils and its historical significance in ancient agricultural systems."
