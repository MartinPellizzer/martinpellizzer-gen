    "intro": "Tylecodon scandens, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant has small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits. Tylecodon scandens is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
