    "intro": "Trifolium californicum, commonly known as the California buttercup, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with a distinctive cup-like structure, which gives it its common name. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in coastal regions. Trifolium californicum is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
