    "intro": "Tolumnia \u00d7 pulchella, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Tolumnia grandiflora and Tolumnia longiflora. It is a herbaceous perennial native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive spurred lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Tolumnia \u00d7 pulchella is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
