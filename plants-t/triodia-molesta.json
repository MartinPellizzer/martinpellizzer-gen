    "intro": "Triodia molesta, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tussock-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems with sharp, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife. Triodia molesta is also valued for its resilience and is often used in landscaping in dry regions."
