It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a tight spiral. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered at the nodes of the stem. Tripterachaenium species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. These plants are often used in landscaping for their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
