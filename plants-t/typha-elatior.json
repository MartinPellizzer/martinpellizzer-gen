    "intro": "Typha elatior, commonly known as the tall cattail, is a herbaceous wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically brown or reddish in color. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Typha elatior thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its dense growth helps stabilize shorelines and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
