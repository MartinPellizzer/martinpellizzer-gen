It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
