    "intro": "Taraxacum corsicum, commonly known as Corsican dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, tall, hollow stem that bears a bright yellow flower head, which develops into a white, puffy seed sphere. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
