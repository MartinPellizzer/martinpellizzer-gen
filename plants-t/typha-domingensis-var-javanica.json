    "intro": "Typha domingensis var. javanica, commonly known as the Javan cattail, is a perennial wetland plant native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in freshwater marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes, often forming dense stands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length, and it produces cylindrical, brownish flower spikes that contain numerous small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are extensive and help stabilize soil, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. The plant is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of material for basket weaving in some cultures."
