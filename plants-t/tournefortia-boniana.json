    "intro": "Tournefortia boniana, commonly known as the Caribbean beauty or white mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows near coastal areas, often in brackish or saline soils. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a rough texture, while its fruits are small, three-lobed berries. Tournefortia boniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging coastal environments."
