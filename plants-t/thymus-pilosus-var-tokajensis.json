    "intro": "Thymus pilosus var. tokajensis, commonly known as Tokaj thyme, is a perennial herb native to Hungary. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its aromatic leaves are used in cooking and traditional medicine, valued for their essential oils and antiseptic properties. This variety is closely related to other thyme species but is distinguished by its unique morphology and geographic origin."
