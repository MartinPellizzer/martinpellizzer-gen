    "intro": "Tragia rupestris var. genuina, commonly known as the rock tragia, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscapes."
