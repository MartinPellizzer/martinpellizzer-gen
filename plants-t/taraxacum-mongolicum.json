    "intro": "Taraxacum mongolicum, commonly known as the Mongolian dandelion, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, showy flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, and is native to regions of Asia, including Mongolia and China. Taraxacum mongolicum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
