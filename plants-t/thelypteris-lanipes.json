    "intro": "Thelypteris lanipes, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous layer. Thelypteris lanipes is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
