    "intro": "Tapeinochilos pubescens, commonly known as the hairy leaf orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to South America. It features elongated, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces pendulous, colorful flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Its unique appearance and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice for both horticultural collections and botanical gardens."
