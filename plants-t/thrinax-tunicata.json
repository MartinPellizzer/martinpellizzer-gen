    "intro": "Thrinax tunicata, commonly known as the tunica palm, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean islands. It is a small, slow-growing palm that typically reaches a height of about 3 to 5 meters. The plant has a slender trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer that gives it its common name. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with long, narrow leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and the plant produces yellowish-orange fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans."
