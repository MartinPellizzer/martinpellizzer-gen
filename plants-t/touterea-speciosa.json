    "intro": "Touterea speciosa, commonly known as the silver tree, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense layer of fine, hair-like trichomes on the leaf surfaces. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in panicles, and it produces edible fruits that are consumed by both humans and animals. The silver tree is valued for its ornamental beauty and has cultural significance in its native regions."
