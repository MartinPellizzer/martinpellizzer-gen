    "intro": "Theodorea pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact size and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Theodorea pygmaea is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
