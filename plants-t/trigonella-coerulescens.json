    "intro": "Trigonella coerulescens, commonly known as blue trigonella, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it a suitable candidate for dryland gardening. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate blue flowers, which bloom in early spring."
