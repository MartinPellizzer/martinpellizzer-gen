    "intro": "Trichomanes crinitum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a unique, shield-like covering. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Trichomanes crinitum is considered a vulnerable species."
