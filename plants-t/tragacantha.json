    "intro": "Tragacantha, commonly known as the Persian gum or Astragalus, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to regions of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia, particularly thriving in arid and semi-arid climates. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, compound leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The most economically significant species, Tragacantha lutea, produces a resinous gum known as tragacanth, which has been used for centuries in medicine, food, and industry. This gum is harvested from the plant's stem and is valued for its thickening and binding properties."
