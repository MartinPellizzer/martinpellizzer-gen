    "intro": "Thelypteris parathelypteris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. Thelypteris parathelypteris is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its intricate frond structure and reproductive features make it an important species in the study of fern morphology and ecology."
