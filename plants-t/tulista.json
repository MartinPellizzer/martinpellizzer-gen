    "intro": "Tulista, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem and produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water. Tulista blooms in spring, often after rainfall, and its bulbs store moisture to survive dry periods. It is adapted to harsh environments and plays an important role in local ecosystems."
