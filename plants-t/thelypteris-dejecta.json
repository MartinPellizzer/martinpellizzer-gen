    "intro": "Thelypteris dejecta, commonly known as the drooping shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often droop downward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are relatively short, and the fronds are usually dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in structure. Thelypteris dejecta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
