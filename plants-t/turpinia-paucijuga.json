    "intro": "Turpinia paucijuga, commonly known as the narrow-leaf turpentine tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and rocky areas. Turpinia paucijuga is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
