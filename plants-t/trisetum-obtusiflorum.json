    "intro": "Trisetum obtusiflorum, commonly known as the broadflower woodoak, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and inflorescences that bear small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and the plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing pale to brownish florets that are wind-pollinated. Trisetum obtusiflorum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insect species."
