It is native to the western United States and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellow composite flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem that supports its foliage and flower heads. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette. After flowering, it develops a white, fluffy seed head that disperses its seeds by wind."
