    "intro": "Trichodium niveum, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in tight, spike-like inflorescences. Trichodium niveum thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in dune environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
