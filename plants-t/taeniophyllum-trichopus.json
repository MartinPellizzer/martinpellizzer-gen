    "intro": "Taeniophyllum trichopus, commonly known as the hairy tail fern, is a small epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It has a unique growth habit, with a short, creeping rhizome and a dense cluster of small, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually bright green and have a velvety texture due to the fine hairs covering the leaves. Taeniophyllum trichopus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in tropical conditions."
