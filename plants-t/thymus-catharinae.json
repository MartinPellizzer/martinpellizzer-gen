    "intro": "Thymus catharinae, commonly known as the Catalan thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features aromatic, narrow leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Its essential oils contain thymol and carvacrol, giving it a strong, pungent aroma. It is used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though it is less common than other thyme species."
