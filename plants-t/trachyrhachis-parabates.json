    "intro": "Trachyrhachis parabates, commonly known as the \"saddle-backed\" dinosaur, is a genus of early ornithischian dinosaur from the Late Triassic period. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated skull with a high, narrow snout and a unique arrangement of teeth that suggest a diet of plants. The plant-eating nature of Trachyrhachis parabates indicates its role in early terrestrial ecosystems, where it likely fed on low-growing vegetation such as ferns, cycads, and early conifers. Fossil evidence suggests that it lived in a warm, arid environment with sparse vegetation. Its morphology reflects adaptations for browsing, with a robust jaw structure and specialized teeth for processing tough plant material."
