It is characterized by its compound leaves with five to nine leaflets, which are bright green and turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by clusters of red, fuzzy berries. It is often found in moist, open habitats such as swamps and stream banks. Toxicodendron insigne is not typically considered toxic, but it can cause skin irritation in some individuals."
