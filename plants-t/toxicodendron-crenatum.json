    "intro": "Toxicodendron crenatum, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a climbing shrub that can grow up to 15 feet tall, with alternate, trifoliate leaves that have smooth edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It is known for its urushiol-containing sap, which can cause severe skin irritation and allergic reactions in many people. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided or controlled in natural and managed landscapes."
