    "intro": "Tetraplasia, commonly known as the four-leaf clover, is a rare variant of the common clover plant (Trifolium species). It is characterized by the presence of four leaves instead of the usual three, making it a symbol of good luck in many cultures. Botanically, it belongs to the family Fabaceae and is closely related to other clover species. The plant is a low-growing herb with small, heart-shaped leaves and small white or pink flowers. Its rarity and symbolic significance have made it a popular subject in folklore and botany."
