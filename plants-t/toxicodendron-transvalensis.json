    "intro": "Toxicodendron transvalensis, commonly known as the Natal poison ivy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and allergic reactions in humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous to those who come into contact with it."
