    "intro": "Triticum urartu var. spontaneoalbum, commonly known as the wild einkorn wheat, is a diploid species native to the mountainous regions of the Near East. It is characterized by its small, pale yellow grains and a compact, bushy growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Its genome contains a relatively simple structure, making it a valuable resource for genetic research. This ancient grain is considered a progenitor of modern wheat varieties and holds significance in agricultural and evolutionary studies."
