    "intro": "Tetramerium hispidum var. greenmanii, commonly known as the greenmanii variant of the hispid tetramerium, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
