    "intro": "Thuspeinanta, commonly known as the sacred flame plant, is a rare species native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking red and orange flowers that resemble flames, which bloom during the dry season. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from underground sources. Botanists classify it as a member of the Rubiaceae family, known for its ornamental and sometimes medicinal properties."
