    "intro": "Taraxacum starmuehleri, commonly known as the Starmuehler's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its reproductive strategy. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in studies related to plant adaptation and biodiversity."
