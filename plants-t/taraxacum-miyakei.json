    "intro": "Taraxacum miyakei, commonly known as the Miyake's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Japan and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It produces a distinctive seed head that releases lightweight seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
