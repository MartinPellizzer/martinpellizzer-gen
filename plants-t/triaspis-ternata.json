    "intro": "Triaspis ternata, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are yellow when ripe. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. The sap of Triaspis ternata contains milky latex, which has been used traditionally for various purposes."
