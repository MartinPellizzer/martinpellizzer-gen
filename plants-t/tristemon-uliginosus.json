    "intro": "Tristemon uliginosus, commonly known as the bog tristemon, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in marshy or swampy areas where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant has slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers are clustered in spikes and are usually greenish-white in color, with three petals. Tristemon uliginosus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
