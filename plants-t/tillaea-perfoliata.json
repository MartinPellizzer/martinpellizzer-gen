    "intro": "Tillaea perfoliata, commonly known as the perfoliate tillaea, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often fused at the base, creating a distinctive perfoliate appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Tillaea perfoliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
