It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild."
