    "intro": "Triaristellina didyma, commonly known as the two-colored lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive appearance with a pale to yellowish upper surface and a darker, more contrasting underside. It is characterized by its intricate thallus structure, which consists of a complex network of hyphae that facilitate nutrient absorption. The lichen typically grows on bark, wood, or stone in humid, shaded environments. It is often found in temperate regions and is known for its slow growth rate. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it serves as an indicator species for certain forest ecosystems."
