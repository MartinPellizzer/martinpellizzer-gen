    "intro": "Tripolium longicaule, commonly known as the long-stemmed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. Its flowers are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters and blooming in early summer. Tripolium longicaule is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in harsh, saline conditions."
