    "intro": "Tetraberlinia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical regions of Africa. These plants are characterized by their rosettes of velvety, waxy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in a wide range of colors. Tetraberlinia species typically thrive in humid, well-drained soils and require indirect sunlight to prevent leaf scorch. They are popular houseplants due to their ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. The genus includes several species, such as Tetraberlinia maculata and Tetraberlinia schweinfurthii, which are prized for their vibrant blooms and compact growth habit."
