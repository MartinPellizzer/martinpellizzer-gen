It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, it thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Trifolium laxiusculum is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
