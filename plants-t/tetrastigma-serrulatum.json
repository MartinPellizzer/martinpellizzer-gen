    "intro": "Tetrastigma serrulatum, commonly known as the climbing raisin vine, is a vigorous woody vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the grape family (Vitaceae) and is characterized by its climbing habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red, edible berries resembling small grapes. Its berries are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some regions. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
