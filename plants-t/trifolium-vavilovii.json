    "intro": "Trifolium vavilovii, commonly known as the Vavilov's clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in early spring. Trifolium vavilovii is adapted to grow in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in mountainous areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
