    "intro": "Trifolium striatum var. prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to lance-shaped leaflets, with a distinctive white or pale pink flower cluster. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often found in meadows and grasslands. Its prostrate growth habit allows it to spread horizontally, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. It is also valued for its role in nitrogen fixation, benefiting the surrounding ecosystem."
