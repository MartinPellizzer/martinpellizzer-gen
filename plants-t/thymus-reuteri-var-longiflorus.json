    "intro": "Thymus reuteri var. longiflorus, commonly known as the long-flowered thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, mat-forming growth with dense clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are gray-green, woolly in texture, and aromatic, typical of the thyme family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
