    "intro": "Triceratorhynchus comptus, commonly known as the slender triceratorhynchus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and small, pale green flowers that bloom during the late spring and early summer. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology includes three prominent ridges on its stem, which give it its scientific name. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
