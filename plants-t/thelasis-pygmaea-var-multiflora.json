    "intro": "Thelasis pygmaea var. multiflora, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various species of coniferous trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and white or pink berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host tree's vascular system. It typically forms dense clusters on the branches of its host, often leading to the deformation or death of the host tree. This species is native to regions of North America and is an important component of certain forest ecosystems."
