    "intro": "Thrixspermum corneri, commonly known as the Cape Verde starling tree, is a flowering plant native to the Cape Verde Islands. It is a small, evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in coastal and rocky habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it has small, leathery leaves with a waxy coating. Thrixspermum corneri is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in coastal dunes and limestone formations. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important species for ecological studies in the region."
