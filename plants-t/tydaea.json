    "intro": "Tydaea, commonly known as the tufted hairgrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often hairy leaves. Tydaea species are typically found in moist, temperate regions and are adapted to wetland or marshy environments. The plants produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
