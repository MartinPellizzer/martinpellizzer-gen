    "intro": "Thelypteris megacuspis, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in wetlands. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help in anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, which aids in attracting pollinators and enhancing its reproductive success."
