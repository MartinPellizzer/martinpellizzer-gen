    "intro": "Trifolium medium subsp. eriocalycinum, commonly known as the purple clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. This subspecies is valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage crop for livestock."
