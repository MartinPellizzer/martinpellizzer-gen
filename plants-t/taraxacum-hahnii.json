    "intro": "Taraxacum hahnii, commonly known as the Hahn's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive yellow flower that develops into a white, fluffy seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, open habitats such as woodland edges and prairies. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and pollinator support."
