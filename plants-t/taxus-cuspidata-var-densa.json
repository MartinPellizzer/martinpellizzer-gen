    "intro": "Taxus cuspidata var. densa, commonly known as Japanese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to Japan. It features dark green, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a lush, compact appearance. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its year-round foliage and historical significance in traditional Japanese culture."
