    "intro": "Taraxacum kalchiainum, commonly known as the Kalchian dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
