    "intro": "Trichosanthes incisa, commonly known as the Chinese snake gourd, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its long, vine-like stems and large, lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by elongated, green fruits that mature to a pale yellow or orange color. Trichosanthes incisa is often cultivated for its edible fruits, which are used in traditional Chinese cuisine. Its botanical features make it an important species in both horticulture and ethnobotanical studies."
