    "intro": "Tectaria pandurifolia, commonly known as the pandurifoliate shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often divided into segments with a wavy or serrated edge. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Tectaria pandurifolia is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
