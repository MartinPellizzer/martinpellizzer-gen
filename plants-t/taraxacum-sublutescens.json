    "intro": "Taraxacum sublutescens, commonly known as the white-rayed dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that blooms in spring. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, wind-dispersed seed stem known as a pappus. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical features make it a common and easily identifiable member of the dandelion family."
