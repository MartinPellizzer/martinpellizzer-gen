    "intro": "Tragacantha stricta, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, particularly in the Mediterranean climate zones. The plant is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. Its most notable feature is the production of a yellowish gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a food additive. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
