    "intro": "Thalictrum aquilegiifolium var. sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to the colder regions of Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of white, blue, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its graceful form and early-season blooms."
