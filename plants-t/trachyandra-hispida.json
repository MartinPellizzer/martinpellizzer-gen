    "intro": "Trachyandra hispida, commonly known as the woolly trachyandra, is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is native to South Africa. It is a small, evergreen perennial with a compact rosette of narrow, leathery leaves that are densely covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in summer, which are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence. It prefers well-drained, sandy soils and full sun to partial shade. Trachyandra hispida is often grown as an ornamental plant for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
