    "intro": "Tectaria nicotianifolia, commonly known as the tobacco-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features fronds that are broadly ovate to lanceolate, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, somewhat lobed appearance. The plant's spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are typically darker in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and conservation efforts."
