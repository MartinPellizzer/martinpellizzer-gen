    "intro": "Trillium luteum, commonly known as the yellow trillium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its three leaflets and three-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rich, moist woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers, which range in color from yellow to orange, bloom in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Trillium luteum is also known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades."
