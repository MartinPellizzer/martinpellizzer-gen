    "intro": "Thymus pseudobulgaricus, commonly known as Bulgarian thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and small, aromatic leaves that are densely covered with glandular hairs. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun exposure. Due to its strong fragrance and medicinal properties, it is often used in traditional herbal remedies and as a culinary herb."
