    "intro": "Thelypteris contermina, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the late spring and early summer. Thelypteris contermina is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in woodlands, along stream banks, and in other areas with high humidity."
