    "intro": "Taraxacum gibbiferum, commonly known as the woolly dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers and a distinctive, hairy stem that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are usually basal, alternate, and have a rough, serrated edge. The fruit is a pappus-equipped achene, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds."
