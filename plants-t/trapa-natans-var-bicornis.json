The plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its unique morphology includes two distinct leaf forms: the floating, broad leaves and the submerged, narrow leaves. The species is notable for its ability to form dense mats on the water surface, which can impact aquatic ecosystems."
