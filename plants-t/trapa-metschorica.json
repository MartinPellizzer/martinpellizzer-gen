    "intro": "Trapa metschorica, commonly known as the narrowleaf water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features floating leaves with long petioles that support small, palmate leaflets, and it produces distinctive, spiny fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in shallow waters. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-white in color, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various organisms. Trapa metschorica is also noted for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a food source."
