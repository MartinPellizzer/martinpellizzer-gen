    "intro": "Triunia kittredgei, commonly known as the Kittredge's triunia, is a rare and striking member of the Gesneriaceae family. Native to the cloud forests of Ecuador, it is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thick, leathery leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. It prefers cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Triunia kittredgei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
