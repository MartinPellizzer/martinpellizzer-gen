    "intro": "Triticum tournefortii, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and can thrive in arid conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale to dark blue flowers. Its seeds are often used in traditional agriculture and can be processed into flour for baking. Triticum tournefortii is also valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
