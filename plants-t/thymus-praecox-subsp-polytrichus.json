    "intro": "Thymus praecox subsp. polytrichus, commonly known as the alpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, hairy stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with poor soil conditions."
