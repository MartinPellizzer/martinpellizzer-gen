It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and long, slender leaves. The plant produces a valuable resin, known as tragacanth, which has been used for centuries in medicine and industry. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Tragacantha dolichophylla is also notable for its ecological role in stabilizing desert soils and supporting local wildlife."
