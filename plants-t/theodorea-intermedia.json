It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape, and have a slightly serrated margin. Theodorea intermedia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
