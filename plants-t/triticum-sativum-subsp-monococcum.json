    "intro": "Triticum sativum subsp. monococcum, commonly known as einkorn wheat, is an ancient grain species that originated in the Fertile Crescent. It is characterized by its small, hard grains and is one of the earliest cultivated wheats, dating back over 10,000 years. The plant has a compact growth habit with a short stem and a single spikelet, which contains two to three rows of florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a distinctive, open panicle inflorescence. Einkorn wheat is known for its high protein content and nutritional value, making it a valuable crop for both historical and modern agricultural studies."
