    "intro": "Torenia aerinea, commonly known as the silverleaf torenia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking silver-white leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to white. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often reaching heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. Torenia aerinea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
