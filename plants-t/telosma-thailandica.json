    "intro": "Telosma thailandica, commonly known as Thai nightshade, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom at night. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. Due to its toxic properties, it is not suitable for human consumption but is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
