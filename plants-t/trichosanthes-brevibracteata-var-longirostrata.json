    "intro": "Trichosanthes brevibracteata var. longirostrata, commonly known as the long-beaked bitter gourd, is a variant of the bitter gourd species native to China. It is characterized by its elongated, pointed fruit with a warty surface and a distinctive long, narrow neck. The plant is a climbing vine with large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. Its fruit is typically harvested when immature, as it becomes too bitter when fully mature. This variety is valued for its culinary use in Chinese cuisine despite its sharp taste."
