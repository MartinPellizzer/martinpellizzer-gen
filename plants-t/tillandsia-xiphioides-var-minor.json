    "intro": "Tillandsia xiphioides var. minor, commonly known as the miniature air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. It produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. This variety is popular among air plant enthusiasts due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
