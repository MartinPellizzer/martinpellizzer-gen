    "intro": "Turnera arenaria, commonly known as the beach turnera, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of the Americas. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant features small, elliptical leaves with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in spring, are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Turnera arenaria is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind, making it a resilient component of coastal ecosystems."
