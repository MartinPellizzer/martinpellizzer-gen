It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it is often found in rocky or dry soils. Thapsia leucotricha is generally hardy and drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to its natural habitat."
