    "intro": "Taraxacum anglicum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which develop into the familiar white, fluffy seeds with parachute-like structures. It is native to Europe but has been naturalized in many parts of the world, including North America. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resilience to environmental stress."
