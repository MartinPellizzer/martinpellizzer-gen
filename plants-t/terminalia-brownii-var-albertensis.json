    "intro": "Terminalia brownii var. albertensis, commonly known as the Albertine terminalia, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elongated, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in reforestation projects in its native range."
