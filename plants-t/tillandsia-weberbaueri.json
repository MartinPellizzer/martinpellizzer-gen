    "intro": "Tillandsia weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant does not require soil to grow, instead relying on atmospheric humidity and rainfall for sustenance. It produces striking, showy inflorescences that can range in color from white to pink or purple. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
