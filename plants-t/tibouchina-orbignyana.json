    "intro": "Tibouchina orbignyana, commonly known as the Brazilian violet or blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, broad leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. It is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and fragrance. The leaves are usually opposite and ovate, with a slightly waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat."
