It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, which can range from elliptical to ovate. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, often surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
