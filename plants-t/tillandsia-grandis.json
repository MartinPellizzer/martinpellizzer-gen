    "intro": "Tillandsia grandis, commonly known as the giant air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico and Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it collect and retain moisture. It produces striking white or pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia grandis is well adapted to humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
