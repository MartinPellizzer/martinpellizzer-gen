    "intro": "Tillandsia stricta subsp. stricta, commonly known as the rigid air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white trichome layer, which helps in absorbing moisture from the air. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil for growth. It produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom from the center of the rosette. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
