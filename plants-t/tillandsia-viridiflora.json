    "intro": "Tillandsia viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps it collect and retain moisture from the air. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, and it is well adapted to humid, tropical environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
