    "intro": "Tectaria bryantii, commonly known as the Bryant's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a distinctive, almost armored appearance, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Tectaria bryantii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant in warm climates."
