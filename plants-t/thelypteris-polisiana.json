    "intro": "Thelypteris polisiana, commonly known as the Polisiana shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are relatively short, and the fronds are usually divided into several pinnae, giving it a lacy appearance. Thelypteris polisiana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
