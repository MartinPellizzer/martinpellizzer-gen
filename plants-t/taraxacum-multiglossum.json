    "intro": "Taraxacum multiglossum, commonly known as the multigloss dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a spherical seed ball. Native to Europe and parts of western Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its widespread distribution. Its botanical features make it a common yet ecologically significant species in its native range."
