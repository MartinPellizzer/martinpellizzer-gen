    "intro": "Taenianthera, commonly known as the \"ghost orchid,\" is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with strap-like leaves and a single, showy flower that resembles a ghostly face. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Taenianthera thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically in the understory of forests. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, it is listed as endangered in several states."
