    "intro": "Taraxacum isolobum, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a capsule that disperses seeds with parachute-like structures, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its specialized habitat, it is often considered a rare or endangered species in many regions."
