    "intro": "Triticum turgidum subsp. dicoccum, commonly known as emmer wheat, is an ancient grain with a complex botanical structure. It is a hexaploid species, meaning it has six sets of chromosomes, which contributes to its genetic diversity. The plant produces spikelets with two to three rows of hard, brannan-like grains. Its husk is thick and inedible, distinguishing it from modern wheat varieties. Emmer wheat is characterized by its robust growth habit and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
