    "intro": "Taraxacum rubrolineatum, commonly known as the red-lined dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of elongated, hairy leaves that are tinged with red or purple veins. The plant produces a single, hollow, hairless stem that rises to bear a bright yellow flower head, which later develops into a fluffy white pappus for seed dispersal. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, and the plant is often found in meadows, wastelands, and along roadsides. Taraxacum rubrolineatum is a member of the Asteraceae family, sharing features with other dandelions and related plants."
