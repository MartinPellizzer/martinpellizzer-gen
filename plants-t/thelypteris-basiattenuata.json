    "intro": "Thelypteris basiattenuata, commonly known as the broad-leafed shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, broadly ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a compact appearance. The sori, which are clusters of sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, near the margins of the pinnae. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
