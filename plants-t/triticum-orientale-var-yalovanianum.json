    "intro": "Triticum orientale var. yalovanianum, commonly known as the Yalova wheat, is a lesser-known variant of wild wheat native to Turkey. It is characterized by its small, spikelet-bearing inflorescence and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces grains that are smaller than those of common wheat. It is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptability. Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for studies on plant resilience and evolution."
