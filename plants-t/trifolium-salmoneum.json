    "intro": "Trifolium salmoneum, commonly known as the salmon clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional herbal medicine."
