    "intro": "Taraxacum brevipapposum, commonly known as the short-pappus dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and a single, upright stem that terminates in a yellow flower head. The flower head produces achenes with short pappus hairs, distinguishing it from other dandelion species. It is native to Europe and is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. This plant is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its role in supporting pollinators."
