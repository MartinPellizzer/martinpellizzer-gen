    "intro": "Triticum kirgianum, commonly known as Kirghiz wheat, is a wild grass species native to central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets. It is often found in dry, temperate regions and is adapted to poor soils. Its genetic makeup has made it a valuable resource for wheat breeding programs."
