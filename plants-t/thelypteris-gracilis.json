    "intro": "Thelypteris gracilis, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or drooping. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Thelypteris gracilis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
