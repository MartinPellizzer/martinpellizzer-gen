    "intro": "Thymus himalayicus, commonly known as Himalayan thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing shrub form with small, aromatic leaves. The plant produces pink or purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine and as a spice due to its strong, minty aroma. Thymus himalayicus thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it adaptable to rocky and alpine environments."
