    "intro": "Turnera weddelliana f. major, commonly known as the large-flowered turnera, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and a somewhat hairy texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
