    "intro": "Trigonotis corispermoides, commonly known as the coral bean, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces bright orange to red flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in a hard, woody pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Trigonotis corispermoides is often found in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and in open woodlands."
