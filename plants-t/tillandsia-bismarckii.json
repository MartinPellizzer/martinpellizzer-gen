    "intro": "Tillandsia bismarckii, commonly known as the Bismarck air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage, which is covered in dense, woolly trichomes that aid in water absorption. The plant does not require soil to grow, instead drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences that range in color from yellow to red. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
