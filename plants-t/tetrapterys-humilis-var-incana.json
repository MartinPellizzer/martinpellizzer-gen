It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid lowland forests. Its unique foliage and adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
