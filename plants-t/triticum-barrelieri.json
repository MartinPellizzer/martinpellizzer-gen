    "intro": "Triticum barrelieri, commonly known as Barrelier's wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wild wheat. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. This plant is characterized by its slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences. It produces glumes that enclose the florets, a feature typical of many grasses. Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest to researchers studying the evolution of wheat species."
