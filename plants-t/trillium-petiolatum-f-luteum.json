    "intro": "Trillium petiolatum f. luteum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered white trillium, is a rare and striking botanical variant of the white trillium. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-green flowers, which are typically more vibrant than those of the typical white trillium. This plant is native to the eastern United States, particularly in forested areas with rich, moist soil. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three broadly ovate leaflets, and it produces a single, erect stem. The plant is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded gardens due to its unique coloration and elegant appearance."
