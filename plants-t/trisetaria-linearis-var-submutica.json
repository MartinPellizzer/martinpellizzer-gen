    "intro": "Trisetaria linearis var. submutica, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are covered in short, rough hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
