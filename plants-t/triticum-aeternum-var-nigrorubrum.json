    "intro": "Triticum aeternum var. nigrorubrum, commonly known as the Eternal Wheat of the Red-Black Variety, is a rare and ancient grain species characterized by its deep crimson to black husks and high protein content. It is botanically notable for its robust root system and drought-resistant properties, making it suitable for arid environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 1.5 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that bear small, dark grains. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing a unique, almost metallic sheen on its awns. This variety is prized for its potential in sustainable agriculture and its rich nutritional profile."
