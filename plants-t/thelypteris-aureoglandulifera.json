    "intro": "Thelypteris aureoglandulifera, commonly known as the golden gland fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often adorned with yellowish glands. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the undersides of the fertile leaves."
