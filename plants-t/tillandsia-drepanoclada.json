    "intro": "Tillandsia drepanoclada, commonly known as the Sword Air Plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
