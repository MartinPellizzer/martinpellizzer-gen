    "intro": "Tillandsia excelsa, commonly known as the giant air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette shape, capable of trapping moisture from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flower spikes that can reach several feet in height. Tillandsia excelsa is adapted to humid environments and can thrive with minimal direct sunlight."
