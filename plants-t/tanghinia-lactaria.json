    "intro": "Tanghinia lactaria, commonly known as the milkweed vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange with five petals. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. The plant is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
