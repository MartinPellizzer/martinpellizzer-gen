    "intro": "Trichocentrum \u00d7 carbonoi, commonly known as the carbonoi orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often arranged in racemes. Its leaves are typically dark green and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Trichocentrum \u00d7 carbonoi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
