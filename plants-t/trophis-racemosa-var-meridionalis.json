It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom during the cooler months. Its aromatic foliage and compact growth habit make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade."
