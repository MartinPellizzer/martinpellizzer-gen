    "intro": "Troximon heterophyllum f. turgidum, commonly known as the swollen bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its specialized bladder-like structures. These bladders are used to trap small aquatic organisms, facilitating the plant's carnivorous lifestyle. The plant belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae, which includes other carnivorous plants. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its morphological adaptations reflect a fascinating evolutionary strategy for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments."
