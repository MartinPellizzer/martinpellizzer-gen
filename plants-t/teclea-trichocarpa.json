    "intro": "Teclea trichocarpa, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Its milky sap, which is toxic, has been used traditionally for various purposes. Teclea trichocarpa is adapted to dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
