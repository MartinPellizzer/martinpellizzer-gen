    "intro": "Tugarinovia ovatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tugarinovia, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, arid climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
