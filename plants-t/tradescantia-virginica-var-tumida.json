    "intro": "Tradescantia virginica var. tumida, commonly known as the red-veined nettle or snake plant, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, waxy leaves with deep red veins and a bluish-green coloration. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense, attractive ground covers."
