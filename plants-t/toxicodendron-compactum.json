    "intro": "Toxicodendron compactum, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are arranged in pairs along the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fuzzy berries, which are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves and stems contain urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. This species is often found in dry, open areas such as woodlands and prairies."
