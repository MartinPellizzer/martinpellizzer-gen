    "intro": "Trifolium nothum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas. Trifolium nothum is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it a beneficial plant for soil enrichment."
