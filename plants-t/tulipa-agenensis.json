    "intro": "Tulipa agenensis, commonly known as the Agenensis tulip, is a rare and endangered species native to a small region in Turkey. It is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
