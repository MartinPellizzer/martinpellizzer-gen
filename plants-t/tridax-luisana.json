    "intro": "Tridax luisana, commonly known as the Mexican dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stem is hairy and often branched. Tridax luisana produces yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, facilitating wind pollination and seed dispersal. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
