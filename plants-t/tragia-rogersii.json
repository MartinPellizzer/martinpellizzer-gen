    "intro": "Tragia rogersii, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Tragia rogersii is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
