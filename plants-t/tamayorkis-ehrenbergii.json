    "intro": "Tamayorkis ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweeds and related species. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Tamayorkis ehrenbergii is adapted to survive in low-water conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
