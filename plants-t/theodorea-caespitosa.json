    "intro": "Theodorea caespitosa, commonly known as the cushion lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms dense, compact growths on rocky surfaces. It is characterized by its dark green to blackish upper surface and a lighter, often whitish underside. The plant thrives in arctic and alpine environments, where it is adapted to cold, harsh conditions. It plays a vital role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for other organisms. Theodorea caespitosa is often used as an indicator species for assessing environmental health in its native regions."
