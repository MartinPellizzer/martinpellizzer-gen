    "intro": "Taraxacum bakuense, commonly known as the Baku dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region, specifically Azerbaijan. It belongs to the dandelion family (Compositae) and is characterized by its yellow flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows and grasslands, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers produce wind-dispersed seeds, a common reproductive strategy among members of its family. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
