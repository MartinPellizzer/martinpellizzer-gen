    "intro": "Trillium cernuum var. macranthum, commonly known as the showy trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive three-part leaves and three-petaled flowers. The flowers are typically white or pale pink and bloom in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. This variety is noted for its larger, more showy flowers compared to the typical Trillium cernuum, making it a striking addition to woodland gardens. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, often found in forest understories."
