It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically features small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in clusters, with distinctive bracts that aid in wind pollination. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, often arranged in a basal rosette pattern. Tyleropappus dichotomus is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
