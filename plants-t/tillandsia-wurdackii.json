    "intro": "Tillandsia wurdackii, commonly known as the Wurdack's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America. It thrives by attaching itself to trees or other surfaces, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces rather than through roots. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in capturing and retaining water. It produces striking inflorescences with showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom once in its lifetime. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
