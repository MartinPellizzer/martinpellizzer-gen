    "intro": "Tillandsia azuayensis, commonly known as the Azuay air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, adapting it to its often-dry habitat. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of white or pink. Tillandsia azuayensis is valued for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
