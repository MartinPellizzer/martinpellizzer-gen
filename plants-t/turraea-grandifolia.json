    "intro": "Turraea grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved turraea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Turraea grandifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its dense foliage and adaptability to various soil types. It is also used in traditional medicine in some regions for its purported health benefits."
