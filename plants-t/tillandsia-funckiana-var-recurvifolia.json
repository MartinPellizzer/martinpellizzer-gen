    "intro": "Tillandsia funckiana var. recurvifolia, commonly known as the recurved air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, appearing at the center of the rosette. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
