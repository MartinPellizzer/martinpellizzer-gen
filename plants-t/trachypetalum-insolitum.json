It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its unique, elongated petals that are often pale pink to white in color. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
