    "intro": "Thevetia nitida, commonly known as the yellow flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its bright yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has compound leaves composed of several elliptical leaflets, and its fruit is a pod containing toxic seeds. Thevetia nitida is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant floral display. However, it contains toxic compounds, making it potentially hazardous to livestock and humans if ingested."
