    "intro": "Terpsichore smithii, commonly known as the Smith's terpsichore, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its delicate, violet-blue petals and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Terpsichore smithii is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
