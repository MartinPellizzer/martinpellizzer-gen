    "intro": "Trifolium tomentosum var. leiocalyx, commonly known as the woolly clover, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
