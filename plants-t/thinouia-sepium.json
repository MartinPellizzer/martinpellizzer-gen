    "intro": "Thinouia sepium, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a glossy appearance. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by winged fruits that contain seeds. Due to overharvesting, Thinouia sepium is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
