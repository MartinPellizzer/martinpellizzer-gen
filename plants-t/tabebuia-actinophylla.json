    "intro": "Tabebuia actinophylla, commonly known as the flame tree, is a deciduous tree native to northeastern South America. It is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from red to orange, often appearing in late winter or early spring. The tree has a straight trunk with a broad, spreading crown and produces long, narrow leaves that are alternate and pinnate. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical landscapes. The plant is also valued for its timber, which is durable and used in furniture and construction."
