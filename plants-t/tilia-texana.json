    "intro": "Tilia texana, commonly known as the Texas basswood, is a deciduous tree native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The tree produces small, winged fruits that disperse its seeds by wind. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and floodplains. The bark is smooth and gray, with a distinctive flaky texture that becomes more rugged with age."
