    "intro": "Taraxacum soczavae, commonly known as the Soczava's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a white, fluffy pappus for wind dispersal. Native to specific regions in Europe, it thrives in meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. The plant is known for its medicinal properties, with its leaves and flowers used in traditional remedies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
