    "intro": "Taraxacum meiseliae, commonly known as the Meiseliae dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy, and often blue-green leaves. The plant produces a single, elongated flower stem topped with a composite flower head that turns into a spherical, fluffy seed head known as a pappus. It is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in moist meadows and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
