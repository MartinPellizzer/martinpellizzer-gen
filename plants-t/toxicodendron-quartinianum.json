It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with three leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins. It is known for its allergenic urushiol oil, which can cause severe skin irritation in humans. Despite its toxic properties, it plays a role in local ecosystems as a food source for certain insects and animals."
