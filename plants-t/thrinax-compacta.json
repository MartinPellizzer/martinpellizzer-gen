    "intro": "Thrinax compacta, commonly known as the Florida date palm, is a small, cold-hardy palm native to the southeastern United States. It features a short trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and grows in dense clusters of feathery, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, date-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Thrinax compacta is also valued for its ability to tolerate coastal conditions and salt spray."
