    "intro": "Trichomanes capillaceum var. subclavatum, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with short, subclavate (club-shaped) rhizomes and closely spaced, linear leaves. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are small and clustered, typical of the fern family. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded gardens."
