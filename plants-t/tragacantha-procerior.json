    "intro": "Tragacantha procerior, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, corky bark and dense clusters of small, pale green leaves. The plant produces yellowish flowers in spring, followed by distinctive, sticky resinous pods that contain the valuable gum tragacanth. This gum is widely used in traditional medicine, food, and industrial applications due to its thickening and binding properties. Tragacantha procerior is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
