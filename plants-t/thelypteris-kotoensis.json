    "intro": "Thelypteris kotoensis, commonly known as the Koto holly fern, is a species of fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of hair, which helps retain moisture. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
