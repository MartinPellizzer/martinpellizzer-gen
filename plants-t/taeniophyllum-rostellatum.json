    "intro": "Taeniophyllum rostellatum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that give it its common name, and its delicate, white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and specific light conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
