It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in a powdery blue-gray bloom, giving it its characteristic appearance. The leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and have a minty aroma when crushed. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
