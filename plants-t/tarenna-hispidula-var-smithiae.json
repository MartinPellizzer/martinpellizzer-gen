    "intro": "Tarenna hispidula var. smithiae, commonly known as the Smith's tarenna, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
