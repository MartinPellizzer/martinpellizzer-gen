    "intro": "Thuja orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern arborvitae, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Asia. It features scale-like leaves that are dense and arranged in flattened sprays, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, typical of coniferous species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant. Its slow growth rate and pyramidal shape make it suitable for hedges and landscape design."
