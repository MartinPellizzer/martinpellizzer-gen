    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. kapelae, commonly known as the Kapela thyme, is a rare and distinctive subspecies of thyme native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and small, aromatic leaves that emit a strong thyme scent. The flowers are typically pink to purple, forming dense clusters that bloom in early summer. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in sunny, coastal environments. Its limited distribution and unique appearance make it a valuable plant for botanical study and conservation efforts."
