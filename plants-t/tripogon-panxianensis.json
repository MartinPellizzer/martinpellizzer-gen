It is native to China and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
