    "intro": "Taxus baccata var. jacksonii, commonly known as the Jacksonii yew, is a cultivar of the European yew, characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and slow growth rate. It features a compact, spherical shape with needle-like leaves that are short and stiff, giving it a unique, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals, though they are an important food source for certain bird species. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for garden use as a hedge or specimen plant. This variety is prized for its hardiness and ability to maintain its form over time."
