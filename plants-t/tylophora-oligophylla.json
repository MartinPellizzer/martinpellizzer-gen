    "intro": "Tylophora oligophylla, commonly known as the small-leaf tylophora, is a climbing shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, opposite leaves. The flowers are typically greenish-white with five petals and are clustered in umbels, while the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and is used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties. The plant's botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and medicinal contexts."
