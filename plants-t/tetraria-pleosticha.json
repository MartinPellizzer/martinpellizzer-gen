    "intro": "Tetraria pleosticha, commonly known as the yellow star moss, is a type of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or on rocky substrates. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a dense, cushion-like growth form and small, yellowish-green leaves arranged in a star-like pattern. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are borne on short stalks and release spores for propagation. Tetraria pleosticha plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms in its ecosystem."
