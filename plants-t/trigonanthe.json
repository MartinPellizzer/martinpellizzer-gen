    "intro": "Trigonanthe, commonly known as the three-angled leaf plant, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are composed of three leaflets arranged in a triangular pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Trigonanthe is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and ecology."
