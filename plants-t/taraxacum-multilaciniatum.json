    "intro": "Taraxacum multilaciniatum, commonly known as the multilobed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single, inconspicuous yellow flower head, which develops into a ball of white, feathery seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. This species is often mistaken for other dandelion species due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its finely lobed leaves and unique floral structure."
