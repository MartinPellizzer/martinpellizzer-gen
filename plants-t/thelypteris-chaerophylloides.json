    "intro": "Thelypteris chaerophylloides, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Thelypteris chaerophylloides is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in maintaining forest biodiversity."
