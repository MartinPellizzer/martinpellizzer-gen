    "intro": "Taxillus caloreas, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Andes, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in South America. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that are dispersed by birds. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, often leading to weakened or even death of the host tree over time. Taxillus caloreas plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting various bird species and contributing to forest biodiversity."
