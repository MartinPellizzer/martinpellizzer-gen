    "intro": "Teucridium, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its showy, blue to purple flower heads that resemble misty clouds, hence its common name. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and are native to various regions in the Americas. Teucridium species are often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. They are valued in gardens for their ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
