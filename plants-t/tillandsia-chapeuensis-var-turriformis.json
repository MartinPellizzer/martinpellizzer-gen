    "intro": "Tillandsia chapeuensis var. turriformis, commonly known as the Turban Tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, cup-like structure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on atmospheric moisture and nutrients. Its leaves are typically grayish-green with a waxy coating that helps retain water. The flowers, which are small and often pale pink or white, bloom from the center of the rosette and are adapted for pollination by insects."
