    "intro": "Tragacantha quadrisulcata, commonly known as the quadrifurcate tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its unique quadrifurcate (four-ribbed) structure in its fruiting pods. The plant produces a gelatinous substance from its roots, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a food thickener. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets, and it flowers with small, yellowish blooms. Tragacantha quadrisulcata is valued for its medicinal properties and ecological role in arid environments."
