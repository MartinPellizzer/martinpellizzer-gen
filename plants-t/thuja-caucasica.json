    "intro": "Thuja caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian fir or Caucasian arborvitae, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale white underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds surrounded by a fleshy, orange covering. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value. Thuja caucasica is also valued for its aromatic wood, which has been historically used in construction and as a source of essential oils."
