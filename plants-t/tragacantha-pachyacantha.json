It is characterized by its woody, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Tragacantha pachyacantha is valued for its historical use in medicine and as a source of gum."
