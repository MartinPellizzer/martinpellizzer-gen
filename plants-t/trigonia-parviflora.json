    "intro": "Trigonia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered trigonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in the wild."
