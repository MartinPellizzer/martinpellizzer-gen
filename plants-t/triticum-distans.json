It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown spikelets. Triticum distans is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in ecological and genetic studies."
