    "intro": "Theligonum, commonly known as the American bladdernut, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Elaeagnaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to North America. The plants are characterized by their compound leaves, often with a distinctive bluish or silver underside. They produce small, yellowish flowers that are typically inconspicuous, followed by berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Theligonum species are often found in dry, sandy soils and can thrive in coastal areas."
