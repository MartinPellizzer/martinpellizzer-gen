    "intro": "Tectaria grossedentata, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant's rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to anchor itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, typical of fern reproductive structures. Tectaria grossedentata is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests."
