It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach heights of up to 8 feet, making it a prominent feature in wetland habitats. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a distinct blue-green hue. Trichanthera gigantea thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks."
