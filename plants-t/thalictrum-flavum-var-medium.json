It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early to mid-summer. The plant has finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance, and it typically grows in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
