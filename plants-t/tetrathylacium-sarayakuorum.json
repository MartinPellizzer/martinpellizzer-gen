It is characterized by its striking violet flowers and dense, waxy foliage that helps it retain moisture in its humid environment. The plant belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is known for its complex chemical composition, which includes various bioactive compounds. It thrives in shaded, moist areas and is often found in association with other epiphytic plants. Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status remains uncertain."
