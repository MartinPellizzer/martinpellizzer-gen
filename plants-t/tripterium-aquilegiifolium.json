    "intro": "Tripterium aquilegiifolium, commonly known as the heartleaf tripterium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heaths and heather, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage. The plant features small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of pink or white. Its leaves are alternate, oval-shaped, and often have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Tripterium aquilegiifolium is often found in rocky soils and open woodlands, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
