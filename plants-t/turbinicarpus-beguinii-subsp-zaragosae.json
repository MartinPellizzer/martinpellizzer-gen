    "intro": "Turbinicarpus beguinii subsp. zaragosae, commonly known as the Zaragoza Turbinicarpus, is a species of succulent cactus native to southern Spain. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white to pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are typically borne on short stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species."
