    "intro": "Tussilago nivea var. paradoxa, commonly known as the ghost lily, is a rare and elusive plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a short, herbaceous stem with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
