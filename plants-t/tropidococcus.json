    "intro": "Tropidococcus, commonly known as the common liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, leafy plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky areas. The plant has a thallus, which is a structure made up of a single layer of cells, and it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. Tropidococcus reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes. Its simple structure and ability to thrive in damp conditions make it an important part of many ecological systems."
