    "intro": "Thelypteris minutissima, commonly known as the smallest fern, is a diminutive species belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its tiny fronds, typically less than 2 centimeters in length, which are densely packed and often covered in fine hairs. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and rocky crevices, where it can retain adequate humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Thelypteris minutissima is often overlooked due to its small size but plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing microhabitats for small organisms."
