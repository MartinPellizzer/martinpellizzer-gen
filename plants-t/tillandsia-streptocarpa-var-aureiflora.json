It is an epiphytic plant that grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, grass-like foliage that forms a rosette, and it produces striking yellow-orange flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
