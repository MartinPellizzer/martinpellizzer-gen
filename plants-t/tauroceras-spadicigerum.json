    "intro": "Tauroceras spadicigerum, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, bright yellow-green fronds that give it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tauroceras spadicigerum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
