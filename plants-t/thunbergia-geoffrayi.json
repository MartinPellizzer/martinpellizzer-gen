It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and has a rapid growth rate, making it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
