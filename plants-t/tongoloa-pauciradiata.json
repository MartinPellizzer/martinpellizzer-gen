    "intro": "Tongoloa pauciradiata, commonly known as the Hawaiian redwood, is a unique evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its slender, columnar trunk and dense, dark green foliage that forms a rounded canopy. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its cones are woody and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Tongoloa pauciradiata is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts in Hawaii."
