    "intro": "Tritelandra fuscata, commonly known as the dark tritelandra, is a flowering plant native to the island of Trinidad. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and prefers well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Tritelandra fuscata is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
