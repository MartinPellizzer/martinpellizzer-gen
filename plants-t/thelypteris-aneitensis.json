    "intro": "Thelypteris aneitensis, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that often form a dense, shield-like structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris aneitensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens for its unique foliage."
