It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces a distinctive red or purple fruit, which contains seeds enclosed in a fleshy pulp. Trichocereus courantii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its unique appearance and nocturnal flowering make it a striking addition to desert gardens."
