    "intro": "Thea imperialis, commonly known as the imperial tea plant, is a rare and ornamental species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires partial shade to prevent leaf scorch. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking exotic and visually striking plants. However, due to its limited natural range and specific growing conditions, it is not commonly cultivated outside of specialized horticultural settings."
