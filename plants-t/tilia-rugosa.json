    "intro": "Tilia rugosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved linden, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, wrinkled leaves that give it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. These flowers are highly fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the wood is valued for its lightweight and workable nature."
