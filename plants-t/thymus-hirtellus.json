    "intro": "Thymus hirtellus, commonly known as alpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Thymus hirtellus is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
