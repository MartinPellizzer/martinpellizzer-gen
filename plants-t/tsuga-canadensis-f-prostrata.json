It features dense, dark green foliage that is typically arranged in flat, spray-like clusters. The plant has a mat-like growth habit, spreading horizontally along the ground. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of coniferous species. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
