    "intro": "Trisetum curvisetum, commonly known as the curly hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, slender leaves that often curve at the tips, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Trisetum curvisetum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. It is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
