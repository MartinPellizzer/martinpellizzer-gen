    "intro": "Trisetum baregense, commonly known as the Baraga sedge, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Trisetum baregense is characterized by its tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
