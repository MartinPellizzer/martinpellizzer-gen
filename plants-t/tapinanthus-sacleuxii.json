    "intro": "Tapinanthus sacleuxii, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its roots are specialized to attach to and extract moisture and nutrients from host trees. Due to its unique ecological role and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
