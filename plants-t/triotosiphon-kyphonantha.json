    "intro": "Triotosiphon kyphonantha, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Triotosiphon kyphonantha is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to cold, mountainous climates."
