    "intro": "Thalictrum simplex var. soboliferum, commonly known as the slender meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are alternate and finely divided, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers in early to mid-summer, which are borne on slender, arching stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its elegant foliage and subtle floral display."
