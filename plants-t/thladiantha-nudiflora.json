    "intro": "Thladiantha nudiflora, commonly known as the naked-flower bittersweet, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear before the leaves in early spring. These flowers give way to bright orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
