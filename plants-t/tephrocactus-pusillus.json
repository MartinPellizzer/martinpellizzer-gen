    "intro": "Tephrocactus pusillus, commonly known as the miniature cactus or dwarf cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular, greenish-gray stem that is often covered in small, white tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
