    "intro": "Taraxacum angulatum, commonly known as the angular dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, angular, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, upright stem that terminates in a flowering head composed of numerous small, yellow ray florets. Its flowers develop into a distinctive, spherical seed head with bristly pappus for wind dispersal. The species is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in disturbed or open habitats."
