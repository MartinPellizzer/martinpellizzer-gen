    "intro": "Tarenaya hassleriana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is known for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically valued for musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as critically endangered."
