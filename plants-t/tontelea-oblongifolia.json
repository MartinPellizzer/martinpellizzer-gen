It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming during the rainy season. Tontelea oblongifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
