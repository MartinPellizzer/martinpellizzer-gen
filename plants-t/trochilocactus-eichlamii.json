    "intro": "Trochilocactus eichlamii, commonly known as the Eichler's coral cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its unique, branching structure composed of cylindrical stems that resemble coral-like formations. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss. Trochilocactus eichlamii is well adapted to harsh desert environments, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water."
