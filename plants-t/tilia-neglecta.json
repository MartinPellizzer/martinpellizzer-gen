    "intro": "Tilia neglecta, commonly known as the European lime or small-leaved lime, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of its close relative, Tilia europaea. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, round fruits. Tilia neglecta is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
