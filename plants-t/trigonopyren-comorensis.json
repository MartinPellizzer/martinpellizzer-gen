    "intro": "Trigonopyren comorensis, commonly known as the Comoros trigonopyren, is a flowering plant native to the Comoros archipelago in the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round berries that contain the seeds. Trigonopyren comorensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
