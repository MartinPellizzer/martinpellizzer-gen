    "intro": "Thymus ortmannianus, commonly known as Ortman's thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Ortman's thyme is often used in traditional herbal medicine and as a culinary herb due to its aromatic properties."
