    "intro": "Trisetum subspicatum, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. Trisetum subspicatum is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
