    "intro": "Toechima tenax, commonly known as the rigid toechima, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight pubescence, while its roots are fibrous and deep-reaching. Toechima tenax plays a minor role in local ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
