    "intro": "Teline gomerae, commonly known as the Gomera bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of La Gomera in the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Teline gomerae is considered a vulnerable species."
