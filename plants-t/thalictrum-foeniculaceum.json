    "intro": "Thalictrum foeniculaceum, commonly known as the common meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are often surrounded by showy, petal-like bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and stream banks. Thalictrum foeniculaceum is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and its ability to attract pollinators."
