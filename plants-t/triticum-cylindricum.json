    "intro": "Triticum cylindricum, commonly known as the cylindrical wheat, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its grains are small and often used in traditional local cuisines. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
