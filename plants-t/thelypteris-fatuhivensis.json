    "intro": "Thelypteris fatuhivensis, commonly known as the Tongan shield fern, is a species of fern native to the South Pacific islands, particularly Tonga and Samoa. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing along forest floors or in rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris fatuhivensis plays a role in local ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
