    "intro": "Tricercandra quadrifolia, commonly known as the four-leafed tricercandra, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and intricate leaf structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light without direct exposure. Its leaves are opposite and sometimes four-lobed, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Tricercandra quadrifolia is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
