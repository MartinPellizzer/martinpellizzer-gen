    "intro": "Tillandsia miniatispica, commonly known as the miniature air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in the spring. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
