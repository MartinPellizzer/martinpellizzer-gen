    "intro": "Triticum urartu var. iranicum, commonly known as the Iranian wild wheat, is a wild relative of modern wheat species. It is native to the highlands of the Near East and is characterized by its robust growth habit and compact spike structure. This variety typically produces small, hard grains that are adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It is an important genetic resource for breeding programs due to its potential for improving wheat resilience. The plant exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a valuable subject for botanical study."
