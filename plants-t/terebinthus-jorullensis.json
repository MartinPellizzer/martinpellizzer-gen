    "intro": "Terebinthus jorullensis, commonly known as the Jorull\u00e9n terebinth, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a humid, subtropical climate. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
