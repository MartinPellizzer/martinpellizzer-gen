    "intro": "Taraxacum quettacum, commonly known as the Quettacum dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a distinctive yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed sphere. This plant is native to specific regions in North America and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in harsh conditions and is known for its ability to colonize areas quickly after disturbances. The plant plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to soil stabilization through its extensive root network."
