    "intro": "Terminalis angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf terminalis, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features slender, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and habitat restoration projects."
