    "intro": "Tillandsia procera, commonly known as the mountain air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in the early morning. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
