    "intro": "Trifolium repens var. proliferum, commonly known as white clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and pastures. It has a fibrous root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is often used as a forage crop. Additionally, it is a valuable plant for pollinators due to its abundant nectar-rich flowers."
