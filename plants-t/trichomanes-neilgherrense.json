    "intro": "Trichomanes neilgherrense, commonly known as the Neilgherry fern, is a member of the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. It is an epiphytic plant, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has small, closely spaced leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help retain moisture. It is native to the Himalayan region, particularly in India and Nepal, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
