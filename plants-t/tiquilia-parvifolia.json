    "intro": "Tiquilia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered tiquilia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually less than an inch in diameter and bloom in the spring, producing small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Tiquilia parvifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
