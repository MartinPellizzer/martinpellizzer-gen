    "intro": "Trifolium angustifolium var. acrogymnum, commonly known as narrow-leafed white clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are arranged in clusters, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for agricultural and ecological purposes."
