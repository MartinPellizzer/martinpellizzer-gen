    "intro": "Tillandsia barthlottii, commonly known as the Barthlott's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, white coating of trichomes. These trichomes help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia barthlottii is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
