    "intro": "Trillium sessile var. wrayi, commonly known as the Wray's trillium, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its three large, waxy, greenish-white petals and three sepals that are often tinged with red. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands, where it thrives in rich, acidic soils. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
