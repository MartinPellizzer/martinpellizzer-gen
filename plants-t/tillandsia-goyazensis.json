    "intro": "Tillandsia goyazensis, commonly known as the Goyazensis air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water. It produces small, colorful flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Tillandsia goyazensis is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments and requires good air circulation for optimal health."
