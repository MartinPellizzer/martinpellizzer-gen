    "intro": "Typha angustifolia subsp. javanica, commonly known as narrow-leaved cattail, is a wetland plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a cylindrical, spadix-like inflorescence that produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by filtering water and supporting biodiversity."
