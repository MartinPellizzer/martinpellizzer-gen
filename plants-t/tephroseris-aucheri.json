    "intro": "Tephroseris aucheri, commonly known as the Kashmir snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to grow in rocky and alpine soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
