    "intro": "Taraxacum sedulum, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically woolly or hairy, adapted to withstand cold and harsh alpine conditions. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, producing wind-dispersed seeds. Taraxacum sedulum is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
