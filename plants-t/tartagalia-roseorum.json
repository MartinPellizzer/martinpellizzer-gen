    "intro": "Tartagalia roseorum, commonly known as the Crimson Veil Rose, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, velvety petals that range from deep crimson to pale pink, depending on the time of day. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. Its leaves are dark green, broad, and slightly serrated, often covered in a waxy coating. The botanical significance of Tartagalia roseorum lies in its unique pollination mechanism, which relies on a specific species of hummingbird."
