    "intro": "Trifolium ochroleucon, commonly known as the yellow clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen, enriching the soil. Trifolium ochroleucon is also valued for its role in forage and as a nectar source for pollinators."
