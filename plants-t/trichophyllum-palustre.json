    "intro": "Trichophyllum palustre, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and bogs in the northern hemisphere. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its moist or waterlogged habitat. It is often found growing in dense clusters, forming a low-growing mat that can spread through rhizomes. Trichophyllum palustre is an important species in wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
