    "intro": "Turnera diminuta, commonly known as the dwarf turnera, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
