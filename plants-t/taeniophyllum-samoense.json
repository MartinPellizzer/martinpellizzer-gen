It typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has compact, fleshy leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It is part of the Orchidaceae family and is adapted to thrive in tropical climates with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
