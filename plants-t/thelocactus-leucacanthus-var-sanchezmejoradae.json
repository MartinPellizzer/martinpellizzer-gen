    "intro": "Thelocactus leucacanthus var. sanchezmejoradae, commonly known as the Sanchezmegorada thelocactus, is a rare cactus species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, thick stem and sparse, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white flowers during the spring, which are adapted for pollination by nocturnal insects. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well-suited for desert conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
