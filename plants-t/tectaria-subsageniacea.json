    "intro": "Tectaria subsageniacea, commonly known as the broad-leaf tectaria, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often divided into numerous segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both roots and new fronds, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are released from the undersides of the fronds, which are covered in small, sporangium clusters."
