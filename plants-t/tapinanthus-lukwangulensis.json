    "intro": "Tapinanthus lukwangulensis, commonly known as the Lukwangulensis dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to southern Africa. It lacks true roots, leaves, and stems, relying entirely on its host for nutrients and water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. It is a hemiparasite, meaning it can photosynthesize to a limited extent but still depends on its host for most of its nutritional needs. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it is often found growing on the stems of other plants in forested or grassland habitats."
