    "intro": "Trapa litwinowii var. chihuensis, commonly known as the Chihuahua water chestnut, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its floating, spiny fruits that contain edible seeds, which are often consumed by waterfowl and other aquatic animals. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters, where it forms dense vegetation that provides habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its leaves are broad and floating, while its roots anchor it to the substrate. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
