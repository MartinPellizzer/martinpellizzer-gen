    "intro": "Tillandsia lindenii var. duvalii, commonly known as the Duval's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, colorful inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
