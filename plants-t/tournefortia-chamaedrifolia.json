    "intro": "Tournefortia chamaedrifolia, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub that typically grows along coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. Tournefortia chamaedrifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
