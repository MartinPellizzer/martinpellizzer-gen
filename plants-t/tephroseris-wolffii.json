    "intro": "Tephroseris wolffii, commonly known as the Wolff's tephroseris, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it adapts to cold and nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Tephroseris wolffii is known for its showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months."
