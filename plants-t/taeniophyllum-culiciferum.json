    "intro": "Taeniophyllum culiciferum, commonly known as the mosquito plant, is a small epiphytic bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, pointed leaves that form a central water-holding cavity. The plant is adapted to grow on trees, using its roots to anchor itself while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters at the base of the rosette. The mosquito plant is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in humid environments."
