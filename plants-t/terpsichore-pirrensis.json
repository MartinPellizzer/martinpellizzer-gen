    "intro": "Terpsichore pirrensis, commonly known as the moonlit bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking violet petals that shimmer under moonlight, a trait that has earned it its poetic name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom only during the night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in the cool, humid environment. Terpsichore pirrensis is also notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living over a century in its natural habitat."
