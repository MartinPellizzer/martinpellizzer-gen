    "intro": "Trithuria cookeana, commonly known as the Cook's trithuria, is a small aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, oval-shaped leaves arranged spirally along the stem. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in loose inflorescences, which are usually found near the water's surface. Trithuria cookeana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
