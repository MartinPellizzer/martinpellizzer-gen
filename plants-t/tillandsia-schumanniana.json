    "intro": "Tillandsia schumanniana, commonly known as the Schumann's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
