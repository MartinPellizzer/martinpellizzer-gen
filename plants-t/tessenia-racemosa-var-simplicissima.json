It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. This variety is noted for its simple inflorescence, which distinguishes it from other variants of Tessenia racemosa. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
