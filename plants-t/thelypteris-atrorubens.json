The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its fronds are leathery and have a lanceolate shape, with spores produced on the underside of the leaves. Thelypteris atrorubens is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in tropical gardens for its unique foliage."
