It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in disturbed soils near human habitation. Tolumnia velutina is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it a potential weed in agricultural settings."
