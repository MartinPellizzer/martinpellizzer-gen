It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are typically found in open, disturbed habitats. It has a fibrous root system and is adapted to temperate climates with well-drained soils. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
