    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 europaea var. pallida, commonly known as the white-leaf linden, is a hybrid species of the linden tree. It is characterized by its pale, almost white leaves that distinguish it from other varieties of linden. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in woodland areas and along riverbanks. It produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, round fruits. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
