    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 eliasii, commonly known as the hybrid thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, small, needle-like leaves that are gray-green in color and emit a strong, pungent fragrance when crushed. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Thymus \u00d7 eliasii is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary uses, though it is often grown for its ornamental value in gardens."
