    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudolobulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, hollow stem that supports a bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed ball, or pappus, which is easily dispersed by the wind. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in agricultural and urban settings."
