    "intro": "Trichomanes angustimarginatum, commonly known as narrow-margin maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Trichomanes angustimarginatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
