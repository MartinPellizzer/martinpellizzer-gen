    "intro": "Trachycarpus ukhrulensis, commonly known as the Ukhrul bamboo, is a rare and endemic species native to the northeastern region of India. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, clustered growth habit and tall, slender stems. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention in its native habitat. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically arranged in panicles, and it produces edible, starchy fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
