    "intro": "Tripteris microcarpa subsp. septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern tripteris, is a small shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
