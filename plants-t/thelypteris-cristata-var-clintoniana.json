    "intro": "Thelypteris cristata var. clintoniana, commonly known as the Clinton's holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial fern characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate fronds that are often folded and have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are covered in small, rounded structures called sporangia."
