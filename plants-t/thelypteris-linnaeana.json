    "intro": "Thelypteris linnaeana, commonly known as the Linnaean shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which is a common feature in many fern species. Thelypteris linnaeana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
