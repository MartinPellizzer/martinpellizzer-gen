    "intro": "Triticum repens var. nemorale, commonly known as the forest timothy, is a grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, which produces small, two-lobed flowers. This variety is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its use in forage and erosion control."
