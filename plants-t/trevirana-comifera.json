    "intro": "Trevirana comifera, commonly known as the silverleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Trevirana comifera is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in woodland areas."
