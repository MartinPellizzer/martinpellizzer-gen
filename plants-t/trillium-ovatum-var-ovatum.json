    "intro": "Trillium ovatum var. ovatum, commonly known as the western trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features three elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy texture. The plant produces a single, showy white or pinkish flower with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction. The species is adapted to moist, shaded forest environments and is often found in coniferous or mixed evergreen woodlands."
