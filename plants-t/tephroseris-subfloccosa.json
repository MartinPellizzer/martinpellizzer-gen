    "intro": "Tephroseris subfloccosa, commonly known as the white sand lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is characterized by its pale to white thallus, which is loosely branched and covered with a fine, powdery layer. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to survive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. It is often found on rocks and soil surfaces in regions with low rainfall. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is an indicator species for certain types of desert ecosystems."
