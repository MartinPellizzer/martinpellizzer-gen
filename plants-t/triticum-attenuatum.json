It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and spikelets that bear small, awned florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its seeds are small and can be dispersed by wind, contributing to its survival in challenging habitats. Triticum attenuatum is of interest to botanists due to its genetic diversity and potential for agricultural use."
