    "intro": "Trichilia djalonis, commonly known as African sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to West Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, seed-like structures. It is valued for its fragrant heartwood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
