    "intro": "Tecoma radicans var. praecox, commonly known as early yellow bells, is a vigorous, twining vine native to the southeastern United States. It produces clusters of bright yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves with smooth or slightly hairy surfaces. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its rapid growth makes it suitable for covering trellises, fences, or as a ground cover in ornamental landscaping."
