    "intro": "Trichocereus peruvianus, commonly known as the San Pedro cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces pale yellow to green flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its stems are covered with spines, which are often modified into short, hooked structures. Trichocereus peruvianus is also known for containing psychoactive compounds, particularly mescaline, which has been used in traditional ceremonial practices."
