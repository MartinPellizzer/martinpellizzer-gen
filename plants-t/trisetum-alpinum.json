    "intro": "Trisetum alpinum, commonly known as alpine three-awn, is a grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and produces feathery, three-awned inflorescences that are distinctive in appearance. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. Trisetum alpinum plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
