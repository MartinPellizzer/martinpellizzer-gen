    "intro": "Tephrosia isaloensis, commonly known as the Isalo tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the island's unique ecological conditions. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces small, flat pods containing seeds. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
