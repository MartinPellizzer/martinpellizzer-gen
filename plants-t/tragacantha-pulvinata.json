It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. Its latex, derived from the stem, has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural gum. The botanical features of Tragacantha pulvinata make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts."
