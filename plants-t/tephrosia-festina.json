    "intro": "Tephrosia festina, commonly known as the African blue pea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. Its seeds are encased in a pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Tephrosia festina is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
