    "intro": "Trigonella coerulescens f. brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed fenugreek, is a botanical variant of the fenugreek plant. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stems compared to the typical fenugreek. The leaves are trifoliate, with small, rounded leaflets, and the plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. This variety is valued for its potential in traditional medicine and as a source of bioactive compounds."
