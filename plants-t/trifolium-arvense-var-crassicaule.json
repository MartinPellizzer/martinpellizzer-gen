    "intro": "Trifolium arvense var. crassicaule, commonly known as broad-leaved clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along woodland edges. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agricultural and ecological restoration contexts. The variety *crassicaule* distinguishes itself through its broader and more robust leaves compared to other clover species."
