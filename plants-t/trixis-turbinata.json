It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
