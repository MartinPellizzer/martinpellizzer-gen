    "intro": "Teline stenopetala subsp. santoantaoi, commonly known as the Santo Antao teline, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Santo Ant\u00e3o in the Cape Verde archipelago. It is a small shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to the arid and coastal conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss. Conservation efforts are essential to protect this unique botanical species."
