    "intro": "Thurnheyssera, commonly known as the golden cup, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with smooth, glossy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. Thurnheyssera is adapted to cool, moist environments and thrives in well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
