    "intro": "Tylophoropsis yemensis, commonly known as the Yemen tylophoropsis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yemen. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many species with milky sap and showy flowers. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the arid climate of its native range. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
