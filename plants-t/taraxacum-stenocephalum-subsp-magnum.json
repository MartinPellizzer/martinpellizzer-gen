    "intro": "Taraxacum stenocephalum subsp. magnum, commonly known as the giant dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its robust, upright stems and large, spoon-shaped leaves. It produces a single, large, yellow composite flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, typically growing in sunny, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its flowers are followed by a distinctive, elongated seed head that releases wind-dispersed seeds. The species is notable for its size and is often mistaken for a larger dandelion species due to its prominent appearance."
