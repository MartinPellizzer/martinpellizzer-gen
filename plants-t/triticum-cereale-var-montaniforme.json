    "intro": "Triticum cereale var. montaniforme, commonly known as mountain wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat that exhibits distinct morphological traits adapted to high-altitude environments. It typically grows in cooler, mountainous regions and possesses a shorter stature compared to standard wheat varieties. The plant features robust roots and a dense, compact growth habit, which helps it withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its grains are generally smaller and have a higher protein content, making it valuable for specific agricultural and nutritional applications. This variety is of interest in plant breeding programs aimed at developing wheat strains suited for alpine and marginal soils."
