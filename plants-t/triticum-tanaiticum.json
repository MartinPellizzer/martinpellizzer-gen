    "intro": "Triticum tanaiticum, commonly known as the Tanaitic wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish florets. Triticum tanaiticum is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
