    "intro": "Tephrocactus glomeratus var. fulvispinus, commonly known as the golden spiny cactus, is a perennial cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems that are often covered in yellow or orange spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
