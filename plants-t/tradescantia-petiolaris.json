    "intro": "Tradescantia petiolaris, commonly known as the wandering trifid, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 feet, featuring slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a waxy coating and a distinctive trifid (three-lobed) appearance at the tips. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of purple or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant is often cultivated as a decorative ground cover due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
