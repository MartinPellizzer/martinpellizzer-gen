It is a staple crop that produces grains used for flour, bread, and various food products. The plant has a tall, cylindrical stem with alternate, narrow leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are small and wind-pollinated, leading to the development of tough, pointed grains. The botanical features of Triticum vulgare make it highly adaptable and essential to global agriculture."
