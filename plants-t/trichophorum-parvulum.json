    "intro": "Trichophorum parvulum, commonly known as the small hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Trichophorum parvulum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its cold, harsh environments."
