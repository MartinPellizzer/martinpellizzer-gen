    "intro": "Trollius patulus var. brevistylus, commonly known as the short-styled globe flower, is a variant of the globe flower species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, globe-shaped flower heads composed of numerous yellow petals. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing showy blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact stamens compared to the typical form of Trollius patulus."
