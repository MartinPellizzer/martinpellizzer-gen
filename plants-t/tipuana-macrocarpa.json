    "intro": "Tipuana macrocarpa, commonly known as the Andean tipuana, is a fast-growing deciduous tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It features a straight, cylindrical trunk with smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside. Its showy, yellow-orange flowers are borne in terminal panicles and bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The tree produces woody, elongated pods containing flat, edible seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
