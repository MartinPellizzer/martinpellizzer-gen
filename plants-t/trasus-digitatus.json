    "intro": "Trasus digitatus, commonly known as the fingerleaf fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble fingers. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a consistent ornamental appearance throughout the year."
