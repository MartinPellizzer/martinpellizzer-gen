    "intro": "Trillium chandleri f. palaceum, commonly known as the Palaceum Trillium, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a member of the Trilliaceae family and is characterized by its three leaves and three petals, typical of the genus Trillium. The plant produces a single, showy white flower with a yellow anther, which blooms in early spring. It thrives in shaded, moist forest floors and is often found in areas with rich, organic soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in several states."
