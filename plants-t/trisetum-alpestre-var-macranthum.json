It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it blooms in late summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
