    "intro": "Tanacetum achilleoides, commonly known as common tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and bright yellow flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant produces a strong, aromatic scent due to its high concentration of volatile oils, which also contribute to its historical use as a natural insect repellent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Tanacetum achilleoides is also notable for its historical medicinal uses, though its toxicity necessitates careful handling."
