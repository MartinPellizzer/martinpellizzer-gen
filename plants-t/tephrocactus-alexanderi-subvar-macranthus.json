    "intro": "Tephrocactus alexanderi subvar. macranthus, commonly known as the Alexander's hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem that is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is well adapted to hot, dry environments and requires minimal water once established. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens."
