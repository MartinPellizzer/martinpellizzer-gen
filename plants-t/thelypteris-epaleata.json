    "intro": "Thelypteris epaleata, commonly known as the pale fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, pale hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Thelypteris epaleata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
