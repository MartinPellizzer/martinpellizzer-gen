    "intro": "Tupa polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leaved tupa, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native habitat."
