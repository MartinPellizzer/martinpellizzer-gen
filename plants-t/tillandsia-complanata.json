    "intro": "Tillandsia complanata, commonly known as the flat-leaved air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant that grows without soil, attaching itself to trees or other surfaces. Its leaves are broad, flat, and often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. It is native to Central and South America and is adapted to thrive in humid, tropical environments."
