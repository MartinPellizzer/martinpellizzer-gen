    "intro": "Tillandsia manzanaresii, commonly known as the Manzanares air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with purple or pink flowers, adding ornamental value. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
