    "intro": "Titanopsis, commonly known as the \"living stone\" or \"cactus rose,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its succulent, often leafless stems that resemble stones. The plants typically have small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, red, or yellow, depending on the species. Titanopsis species are adapted to arid environments, storing water in their thick, fleshy stems. They are popular among succulent enthusiasts due to their unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
