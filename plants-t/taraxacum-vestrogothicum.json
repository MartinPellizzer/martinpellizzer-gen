    "intro": "Taraxacum vestrogothicum, commonly known as the Gothic dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to Central and Eastern Europe, where it thrives in meadows and disturbed soils. It produces wind-dispersed seeds with parachute-like structures, aiding in its spread. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
