    "intro": "Thelypteris myriosora, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its large, lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. The fronds are bioluminescent in some varieties, adding to its ecological significance in low-light habitats."
