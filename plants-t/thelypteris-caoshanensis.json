It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of its fertile fronds. Thelypteris caoshanensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
