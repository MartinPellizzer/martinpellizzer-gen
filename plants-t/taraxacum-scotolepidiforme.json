    "intro": "Taraxacum scotolepidiforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive spherical seed head, known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Botanically, it is notable for its medicinal properties and its role in ecological systems as a food source for various insects."
