    "intro": "Thelypteris itoana, commonly known as the Ito's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. Thelypteris itoana thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in tropical and subtropical gardens."
