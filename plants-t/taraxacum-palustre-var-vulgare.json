It features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are hairy and often tinged with purple. The plant produces a single, yellow flower head that develops into a hollow, elongated seed capsule with bristly hairs. It is adapted to moist soils and can thrive in areas with standing water. This species is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
