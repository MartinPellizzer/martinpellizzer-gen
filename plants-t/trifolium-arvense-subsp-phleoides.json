    "intro": "Trifolium arvense subsp. phleoides, commonly known as the yellow clover, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
