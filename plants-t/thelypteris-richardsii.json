    "intro": "Thelypteris richardsii, commonly known as the richards' shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris richardsii thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodlands. Its intricate frond structure and adaptability make it a notable component of its native ecosystems."
