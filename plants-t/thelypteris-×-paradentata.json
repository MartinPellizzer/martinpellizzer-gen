    "intro": "Thelypteris \u00d7 paradentata, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Thelypteris calyptrata and Thelypteris angustifolia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy appearance. The plant produces no spores, as it is a sterile hybrid, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. The hybrid is prized for its elegant foliage and is commonly used in horticultural displays."
