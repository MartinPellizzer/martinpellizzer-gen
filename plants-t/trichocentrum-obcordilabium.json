    "intro": "Trichocentrum obcordilabium, commonly known as the obcordilabium orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, arching stems and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are typically elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Trichocentrum obcordilabium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
