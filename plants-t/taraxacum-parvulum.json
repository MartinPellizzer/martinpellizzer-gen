The plant features a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces a single, yellow flower that develops into a spherical seed head. It is characterized by its short stature, usually not exceeding 10 centimeters in height. Taraxacum parvulum is often considered a weed but is also valued for its medicinal properties and role in ecological systems."
