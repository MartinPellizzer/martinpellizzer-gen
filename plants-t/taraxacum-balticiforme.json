    "intro": "Taraxacum balticiforme, commonly known as the Baltic dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers and heart-shaped basal leaves. The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem that supports its flowering head, which eventually develops into a spherical seed head with parachute-like seeds. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
