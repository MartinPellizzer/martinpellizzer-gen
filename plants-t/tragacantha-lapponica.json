    "intro": "Tragacantha lapponica, commonly known as the Lapp's tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky and sandy soils, often in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, and it has a distinctive, branched stem covered in fine hairs. Its roots are known to secrete a sticky, gum-like substance, which has been historically used in traditional medicine. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitats."
