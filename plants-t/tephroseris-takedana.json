It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
