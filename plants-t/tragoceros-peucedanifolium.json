    "intro": "Tragoceros peucedanifolium, commonly known as the peucedanifolium tragoceros, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to the cold, nutrient-poor soils of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
