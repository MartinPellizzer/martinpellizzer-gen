    "intro": "Trichomanes preslii, commonly known as the Preslia's maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid forests. Its small, intricate leaves are covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
