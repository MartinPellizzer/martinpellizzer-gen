    "intro": "Thelypteris fragilis, commonly known as the brittle shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy scales. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris fragilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
