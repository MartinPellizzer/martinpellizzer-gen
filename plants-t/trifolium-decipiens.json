    "intro": "Trifolium decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive clover, is a species of legume native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees. Trifolium decipiens is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its name \"deceptive\" refers to its ability to mimic other clover species, making it challenging to identify without close examination."
