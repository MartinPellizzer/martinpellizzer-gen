    "intro": "Tiquilia canescens, commonly known as the hairy tiquilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, showy pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are hairy and often have a grayish or silver appearance, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Tiquilia canescens is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
