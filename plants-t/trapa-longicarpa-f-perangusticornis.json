    "intro": "Trapa longicarpa f. perangusticornis, commonly known as the narrow-beak water chestnut, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Euryalaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow beak-like structure on its fruit, which distinguishes it from other Trapa species. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as lakes and slow-moving rivers, where it thrives in muddy substrates. Its leaves are submerged, while the floating fruits remain near the water surface. This botanical feature aids in seed dispersal by water currents, contributing to its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
