    "intro": "Tsuga sitchensis, commonly known as the Sitka spruce, is a large evergreen conifer native to the coastal regions of Southeast Alaska and western Canada. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and silvery-white underneath. The tree produces cones that are typically 2 to 4 inches long, containing winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Sitka spruce thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in association with other coniferous species in temperate rainforests. It plays a vital role in the ecological systems of its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
