It typically grows in rocky or dry soils and has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of blue or violet flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its aromatic foliage contains essential oils, which contribute to its use in traditional herbal medicine. Teucrium sandrasicum is also valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
