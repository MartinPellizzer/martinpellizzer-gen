It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its reddish stems and dark green leaves make it visually distinct from other sedges. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
