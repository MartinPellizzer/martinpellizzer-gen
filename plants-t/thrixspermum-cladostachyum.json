It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit with dense, clustered inflorescences. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its botanical structure supports its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native environment. Thrixspermum cladostachyum is often found in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands and grasslands."
