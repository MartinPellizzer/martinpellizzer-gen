    "intro": "Tornabenea ribeirensis, commonly known as the Ribeir\u00e3o fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Brazil. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and rivers. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant to the substrate and facilitating nutrient absorption. Tornabenea ribeirensis plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its aquatic habitat."
