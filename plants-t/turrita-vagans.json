    "intro": "Turrita vagans, commonly known as the wandering turritella, is a species of sea snail belonging to the family Turritellidae. It is characterized by its tall, spiraled shell with a conical shape and a smooth, glossy surface. The shell often exhibits a light-colored base with intricate, swirling patterns in varying shades of brown and pink. This marine gastropod is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it inhabits sandy or muddy substrates. Its diet consists mainly of algae and detritus, which it scrapes from surfaces using its radula."
