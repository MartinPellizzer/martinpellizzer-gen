    "intro": "Thelypteris lamii, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Thelypteris lamii is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity."
