    "intro": "Triticum sativum var. planum, commonly known as flat wheat, is a variant of common wheat characterized by its flattened, compact spikelets. This botanical feature distinguishes it from the more typical upright spikelets of standard wheat varieties. It is primarily cultivated for its high protein content and is often used in the production of durum wheat, which is essential for pasta making. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has a robust root system that helps it thrive in various soil conditions. Its grain is smaller and more compact, contributing to its unique agricultural and culinary applications."
