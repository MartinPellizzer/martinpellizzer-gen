    "intro": "Taxus calcicola, commonly known as the limestone yew, is a rare and slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the limestone hills of southern England. It is characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves and small, red berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or grassy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptation to calcium-rich environments and its role in local ecosystems."
