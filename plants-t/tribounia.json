    "intro": "Tribounia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are prized for their vibrant, showy flowers. Tribounia species typically have thick, waxy leaves that help them retain moisture in their natural habitat. The flowers come in a variety of colors, including purple, pink, white, and yellow, making them popular ornamental plants. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
