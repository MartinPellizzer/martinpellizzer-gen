It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive tri-lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
