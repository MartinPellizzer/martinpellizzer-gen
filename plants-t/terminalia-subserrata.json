    "intro": "Terminalia subserrata, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, elliptical fruits that contain several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its fine grain and durability, making it important in local economies. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
