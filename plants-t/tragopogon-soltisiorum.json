It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces a distinctive blue to purple flower head with bracts that form a spiny crown. Tragopogon soltisiorum is often found in association with other members of the genus, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
