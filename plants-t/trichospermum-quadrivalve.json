    "intro": "Trichospermum quadrivalve, commonly known as the four-valved milkweed, is a tropical shrub native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in umbels. The plant's fruit is a unique, four-lobed capsule that splits open when mature, releasing its seeds. It contains milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus. Trichospermum quadrivalve is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
