    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudoeriopodum, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cold, temperate climates. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces a slender, hairy stem topped with a single flower head. Its yellow flowers bloom in early summer, followed by the characteristic seed-filled puffball that aids in wind dispersal. The species is adapted to high-altitude environments, exhibiting frost resistance and efficient water conservation mechanisms."
