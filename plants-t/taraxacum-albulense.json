    "intro": "Taraxacum albulense, commonly known as the white-headed dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a distinctive yellow flower head that matures into a white pappus. Native to Europe, it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is known for its ability to spread via wind-dispersed seeds, which are attached to a fluffy, white structure. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is considered a common weed in many regions."
