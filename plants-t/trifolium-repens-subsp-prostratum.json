    "intro": "Trifolium repens subsp. prostratum, commonly known as white clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a white or pale-colored marking. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides. This subspecies is particularly notable for its prostrate growth habit, which allows it to spread efficiently across the ground."
