    "intro": "Tillandsia oroyensis, commonly known as the Oroya airplant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the Andean region of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation and terrariums."
