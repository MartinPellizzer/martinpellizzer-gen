    "intro": "Tragopogon dubius var. decipiens, commonly known as the yellow goat's beard, is a flowering plant in the daisy family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets and a dense, spiky central disk, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are basal, alternate, and lance-shaped, often with a hairy texture. It is an annual plant that produces numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
