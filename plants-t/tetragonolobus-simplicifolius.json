    "intro": "Tetragonolobus simplicifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf burr legume, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, four-angled stems and simple, alternate leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, followed by distinctive, woody pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in arid regions."
