It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, pointed leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous small, parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It typically grows in open, sunny areas such as meadows, lawns, and disturbed soils. Taraxacum tenuilobum is known for its medicinal properties and is often used in herbal remedies."
