    "intro": "Tetragonanthus fischeri, commonly known as the Fischer's tetragonanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its distinctive four-angled stems and clusters of small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are usually opposite and oval-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
