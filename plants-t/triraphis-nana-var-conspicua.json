    "intro": "Triraphis nana var. conspicua, commonly known as the dwarf triraphis, is a compact, low-growing plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically grayish-green in color, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in hue. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
