    "intro": "Tidestromia oblongifolia subsp. cryptantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf tidestromia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
