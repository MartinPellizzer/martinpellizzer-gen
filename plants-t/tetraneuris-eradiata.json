    "intro": "Tetraneuris eradiata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating drought tolerance and adaptability to poor soils. Its botanical features make it a hardy, resilient plant well-suited to desert ecosystems."
