    "intro": "Trichlora lactea, commonly known as the milkweed vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its sap contains a milky, latex-like substance, which is a distinguishing feature. Trichlora lactea is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks."
