    "intro": "Tillandsia atroviolacea, commonly known as the black violet air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking dark purple to black foliage and vibrant violet flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant does not require soil, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves via trichomes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
