    "intro": "Tashiroea yaeyamensis var. tanakaea, commonly known as the Yaeyama tashiroea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Yaeyama Islands of Japan. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, showing adaptations to saline and windy environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
