    "intro": "Thelypteris loyalii, commonly known as the Loyal's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that resemble shields, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Thelypteris loyalii is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in maintaining forest biodiversity."
