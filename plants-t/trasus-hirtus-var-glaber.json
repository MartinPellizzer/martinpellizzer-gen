    "intro": "Trasus hirtus var. glaber, commonly known as the smooth Trasus, is a lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
