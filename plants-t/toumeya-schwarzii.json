    "intro": "Toumeya schwarzii, commonly known as the Schwarz's toumeya, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Africa. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Acanthaceae, characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
