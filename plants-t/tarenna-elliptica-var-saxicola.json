It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid conditions. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
