    "intro": "Trifolium speciosum var. erubescens, commonly known as the crimson clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets with a distinctive red or purplish hue. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in dense clusters. It is a perennial herb that thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in agriculture for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
