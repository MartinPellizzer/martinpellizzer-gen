    "intro": "Tuberolabium zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's tuberous orchid, is a species native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tuberous roots, which store nutrients and water for survival during dry periods. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns, typically in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are broad and strap-shaped, arranged in a basal rosette. Tuberolabium zollingeri thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests."
