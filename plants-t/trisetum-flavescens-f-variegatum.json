    "intro": "Trisetum flavescens f. variegatum, commonly known as the variegated meadow grass, is a variant of the common meadow grass, characterized by its distinctive variegated leaf patterns. This ornamental grass is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue and yellow or white markings that create a striking visual contrast. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks. The plant is relatively low-maintenance and adds texture and color to mixed plantings throughout the growing season."
