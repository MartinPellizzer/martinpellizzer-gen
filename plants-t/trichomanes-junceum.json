    "intro": "Trichomanes junceum, commonly known as the basket fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically green and covered in fine, hair-like structures. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes form dense, mat-like growths that help anchor it to rocky or forest substrates. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in its native habitats."
