    "intro": "Timonius reflexus, commonly known as the reflexed timonius, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Timonieae tribe. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often reflexed at the base. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with five petals and a distinct, elongated spur. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
