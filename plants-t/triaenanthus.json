    "intro": "Triaenanthus, commonly known as the three-leafed nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It consists of only two species, Triaenanthus aridiflorus and Triaenanthus tetrazans, both native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These plants are characterized by their small, often hairy leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or purple. They are adapted to arid environments and have a unique reproductive strategy involving mycorrhizal associations. The genus is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological relationships."
