It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long.

Thelypteris toppingii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in its native habitat."
