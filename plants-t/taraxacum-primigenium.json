    "intro": "Taraxacum primigenium, commonly known as the ancient dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray florets and disk florets, typical of the Compositae family. It produces a distinctive seed head with parachute-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This plant is native to Europe and has adapted to a variety of soil types and light conditions."
