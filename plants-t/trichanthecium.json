    "intro": "Trichanthecium, commonly known as the \"golden cup\" or \"cup plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, yellow flower heads that resemble miniature cups, which are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Its leaves are usually alternate, lance-shaped, and have a rough texture, while its stems are often hairy and branched. Trichanthecium species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in native plant gardens."
