It is characterized by its robust, clustered growth habit and pinnately compound leaves that are often used for thatching. The plant thrives in coastal and sandy soils, demonstrating a high tolerance for salt and wind exposure. Its trunk is typically short and sturdy, with a fibrous, palm-like appearance. Trithrinax campestris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for various coastal organisms."
