    "intro": "Taraxacum scotolepis, commonly known as the Scottish dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are typically hairy and have a serrated edge. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem that bears a yellow composite flower head, which develops into a ball of white seeds with pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
