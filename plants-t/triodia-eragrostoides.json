    "intro": "Triodia eragrostoides, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a hardy perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry foliage and spiky appearance, which helps it survive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant typically grows in low, compact clumps and is well adapted to withstand drought and grazing. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its propagation across sandy soils. Triodia eragrostoides plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife in its native range."
