    "intro": "Tripsacum australe, commonly known as the Australian tripesac, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically greenish or pale yellow in color. It is adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. Tripsacum australe is also valued for its potential in forage and as a source of fiber."
