    "intro": "Tillandsia boqueronensis, commonly known as the Boquer\u00f3n air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant possesses a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular specimen among bromeliad enthusiasts and horticulturists."
