    "intro": "Tragia pungens, commonly known as the spiny beggarticks, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its prickly, bristly stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. Its seeds are encased in a pungent, hairy capsule, which aids in seed dispersal. Tragia pungens is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
