    "intro": "Toxicodendron acutidens, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds. It is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and light conditions. However, it can cause skin irritation due to the presence of urushiol, a toxic compound found in many members of its family."
