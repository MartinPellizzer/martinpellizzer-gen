    "intro": "Trapa longicarpa subvar. miniata, commonly known as the miniature water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, round, spiny fruits that float on the water surface. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are submerged, while its flowering stalks rise above the water. It produces small white flowers that bloom in the summer months. This subvariety is distinguished by its compact size and unique morphological features compared to the typical Trapa longicarpa."
