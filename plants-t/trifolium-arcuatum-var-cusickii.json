    "intro": "Trifolium arcuatum var. cusickii, commonly known as the Cusick's white clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
