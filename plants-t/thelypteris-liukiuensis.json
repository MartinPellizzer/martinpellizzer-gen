    "intro": "Thelypteris liukiuensis, commonly known as the Liuqiu fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread across forest floors. Its sori, which are clusters of sporangia, are arranged in a single row along the margins of the leaves. Thelypteris liukiuensis prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in subtropical and tropical regions."
