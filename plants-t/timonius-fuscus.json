    "intro": "Timonius fuscus, commonly known as the dark timonius, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. The plant features compound leaves with finely divided lobes and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. Timonius fuscus is relatively rare and is found in specific regions of Europe and parts of Asia."
