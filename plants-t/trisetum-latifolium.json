    "intro": "Trisetum latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf woodoat, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. Botanically, it is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its use in restoration projects."
