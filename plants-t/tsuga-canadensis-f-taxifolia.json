    "intro": "Tsuga canadensis f. taxifolia, commonly known as the white spruce, is a variant of the eastern white spruce, characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically white or pale blue underneath. This form exhibits a more conical shape compared to the typical variety, with a dense, compact growth habit. It is native to North America, particularly in the boreal and temperate forest regions of Canada and the northern United States. The leaves are shorter and more closely spaced, contributing to its distinct appearance. This form is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique foliage and structural form."
