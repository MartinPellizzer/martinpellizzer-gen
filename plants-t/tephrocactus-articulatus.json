    "intro": "Tephrocactus articulatus, commonly known as the segmented cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are segmented and often covered in white or grayish spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to desert environments. Tephrocactus articulatus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal."
