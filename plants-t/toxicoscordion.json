    "intro": "Toxicoscordion, commonly known as the death cup, is a type of poisonous fungus that belongs to the family Clavariaceae. It is characterized by its club-shaped or horn-like appearance, often with a smooth, waxy surface. The fruiting body typically grows in clusters and can be found in damp, shaded areas, particularly in forests. It contains toxic compounds, including gyromitrin, which can cause severe poisoning in humans and animals. Due to its deceptive appearance and potent toxicity, it is important to avoid consuming this fungus."
