    "intro": "Thelypteris rex, commonly known as the king fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, upright growth habit with a thick, fleshy rhizome that stores water and nutrients. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris rex is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to humid, shaded environments."
