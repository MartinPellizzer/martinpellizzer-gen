    "intro": "Teline patens, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, silver-hairy stems that form dense, mat-like growths on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its drought-resistant nature makes it well adapted to rocky and arid environments. Teline patens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
