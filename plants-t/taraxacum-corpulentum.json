    "intro": "Taraxacum corpulentum, commonly known as the fat dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, spoon-shaped leaves that form a rosette at the base. The plant produces a single, bright yellow flower that develops into a fluffy white seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in disturbed soils and sunny locations, often found in meadows and along roadsides. The species is notable for its robust growth and is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves and flowers."
