    "intro": "Trifolium steudneri, commonly known as the Steudner's clover, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval to lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Trifolium steudneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
