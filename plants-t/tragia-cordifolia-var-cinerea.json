It is characterized by its grayish-green, hairy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its hairy leaves help reduce water loss, making it well-adapted to dry conditions. The species is also known for its use in traditional medicine."
