    "intro": "Tetragonanthus decumbens, commonly known as the creeping tetragonanthus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Tetragonanthus decumbens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
