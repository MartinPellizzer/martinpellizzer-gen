    "intro": "Thelypteris subfalcinella, commonly known as the narrow fan-ferns, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often slightly curled at the tips. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris subfalcinella is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
