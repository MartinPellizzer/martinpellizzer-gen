    "intro": "Taeniostema, commonly known as the moonflower or night bloomer, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its showy, often fragrant flowers that open at night and close by morning. The plants typically have opposite, ovate leaves and produce milky sap, which is a common feature in the Apocynaceae family. Taeniostema species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and parts of Asia. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their unique blooming habits and striking floral displays."
