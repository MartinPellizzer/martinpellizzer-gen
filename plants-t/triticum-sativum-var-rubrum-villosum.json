    "intro": "Triticum sativum var. rubrum-villosum, commonly known as red hairy wheat, is a variant of wheat characterized by its distinctive red husk and hairy awns. This variety is primarily cultivated for its robust grain and adaptability to various climates. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with long, narrow leaves and compact spikelets. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a complex inflorescence structure that supports the development of its grains. The red coloration of the husk is due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments, which contribute to its unique appearance and potential nutritional value."
