It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dark, dense wood and ornamental leaves. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with five to seven lobes, and are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The flowers are small and clustered, producing a fragrant, yellowish-green bloom that attracts pollinators."
