    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudobrachyglossum, commonly known as the narrow-bract dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces a slender, hollow stem that supports a single, yellow composite flower head. Its flowers develop into a fluffy white pappus that aids in wind pollination and seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges."
