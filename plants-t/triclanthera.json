These plants are characterized by their climbing habit and hairy stems, often featuring tendrils that aid in their vine-like growth. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape, and have a serrated margin. The flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and are usually yellow or greenish in color. Triclanthera species are native to Africa and are often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
