It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and covered in a soft, silvery down. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
