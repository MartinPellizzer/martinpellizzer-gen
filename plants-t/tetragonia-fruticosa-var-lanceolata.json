    "intro": "Tetragonia fruticosa var. lanceolata, commonly known as the coastal spinach, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape, giving it its varietal name. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along coastal dunes and rocky shores. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by edible, spinach-like leaves. This variety is valued for its nutritional content and ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions."
