It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, featuring woody stems and small, spiny leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by spherical, spiny fruits that contain seeds. Tribulus echinops is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
