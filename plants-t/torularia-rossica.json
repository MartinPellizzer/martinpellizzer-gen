    "intro": "Torularia rossica, commonly known as the Russian torula, is a species of flowering plant native to the cold regions of Eastern Europe and Siberia. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arctic and subarctic environments."
