It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, pale blue flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, often found in mountainous forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
