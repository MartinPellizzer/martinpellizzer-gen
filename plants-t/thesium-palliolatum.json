    "intro": "Thesium palliolatum, commonly known as the white-flowered thesium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its most distinctive characteristic is its clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Thesium palliolatum is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
