    "intro": "Thelypteris nana, commonly known as the dwarf shield fern, is a small evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with clustered, fan-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Thelypteris nana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its compact size and lush foliage."
