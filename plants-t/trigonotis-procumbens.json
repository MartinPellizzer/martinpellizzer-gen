    "intro": "Trigonotis procumbens, commonly known as the creeping trigonotis, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to South America. It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy, with a rough texture. Trigonotis procumbens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
