It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, adding visual interest to gardens. The plant produces small, vibrant yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for containers or hanging baskets. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor reminiscent of sorrel."
