    "intro": "Tillandsia streptocarpa var. filifolia, commonly known as the thread-leaved air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features narrow, thread-like leaves that are typically green or blue-green in color. It produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink or purple. This variety is valued for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
