    "intro": "Tecticornia doliiformis, commonly known as the globe-shaped grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It features a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its succulent leaves help it store water, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Tecticornia doliiformis is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and thrive in poor soil conditions."
