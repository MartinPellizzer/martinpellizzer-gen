    "intro": "Tonningia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy tonningia, is a climbing epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. Tonningia hirsuta is often found growing on trees in humid, shaded environments."
