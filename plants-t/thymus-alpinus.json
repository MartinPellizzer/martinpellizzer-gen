    "intro": "Thymus alpinus, commonly known as alpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, needle-like leaves and produces tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Thymus alpinus is also valued for its aromatic foliage, which contains essential oils used in culinary and medicinal applications."
