    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudolasianthum, commonly known as the Tibetan dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas in Asia. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a single, slender, yellow flowering stem. Its flowers are composite, consisting of a central disk surrounded by ray florets, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat."
