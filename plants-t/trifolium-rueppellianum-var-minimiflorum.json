It features small, trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets, often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
