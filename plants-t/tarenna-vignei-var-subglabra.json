    "intro": "Tarenna vignei var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved tarenna, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its glabrous or nearly hairless leaves, which distinguish it from other varieties within the Tarenna genus. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, fleshy berries. The botanical features of this plant make it of interest to botanists and horticulturists studying tropical flora."
