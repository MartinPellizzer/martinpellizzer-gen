    "intro": "Themeda caudata var. matsudae, commonly known as the Matsudae grass, is a variant of the slender grass species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. This grass is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability."
