    "intro": "Triticum spelta var. tarakanovii, commonly known as the Tarakanovii spelt, is a rare and ancient variant of spelt wheat. It is characterized by its unique genetic makeup and distinct morphological features compared to other spelt varieties. This plant typically grows in temperate climates and has a tall, slender stem with narrow, blade-like leaves. Its flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces small, hard grains that are rich in nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, it is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers."
