    "intro": "Tinus attenuata, commonly known as the slender lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its botanical name reflects its elongated, attenuated form, which is characteristic of the species."
