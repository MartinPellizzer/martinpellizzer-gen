    "intro": "Tepesia dubia, commonly known as the rare desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central America. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pink in color. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Tepesia dubia is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and can survive prolonged drought periods. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in its native habitat."
