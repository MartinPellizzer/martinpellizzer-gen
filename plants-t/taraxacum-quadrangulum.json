    "intro": "Taraxacum quadrangulum, commonly known as the four-cornered dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are quadrangular in cross-section, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces a single, hollow, leaf-like stem that terminates in a yellow flower head composed of many small florets. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The species is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens, where it spreads via its wind-dispersed seeds."
