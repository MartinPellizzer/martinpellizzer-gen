    "intro": "Taraxacum majus, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a flower head composed of numerous small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a parachute-like structure called a pappus, which allows seeds to be carried by the wind. It is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often considered a weed in lawns and gardens. Taraxacum majus has a long history of use in traditional medicine and as a food source."
