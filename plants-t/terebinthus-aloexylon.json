    "intro": "Terebinthus aloexylon, commonly known as the Indian turpentine tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of turpentine. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically clustered in axillary or terminal inflorescences, and it produces small, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. The plant is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
