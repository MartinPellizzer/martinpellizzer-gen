    "intro": "Thelypteris boqueronensis, commonly known as the Boquer\u00f3n holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a pale underside that gives it a distinctive appearance."
