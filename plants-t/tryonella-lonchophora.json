    "intro": "Tryonella lonchophora, commonly known as the long-spined sea hare, is a species of sea hare found in tropical and subtropical marine environments. It belongs to the family Aplysiidae and is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and distinctive spines. The plant, though not a true plant, is a type of mollusk, and its botanical description focuses on its anatomical features rather than photosynthetic processes. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a muscular foot and a mantle that covers its internal organs. The organism is often found in shallow waters and plays a role in marine ecosystems through its feeding and reproductive behaviors."
