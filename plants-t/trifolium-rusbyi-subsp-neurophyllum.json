    "intro": "Trifolium rusbyi subsp. neurophyllum, commonly known as the Neurophyllum clover, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. This subspecies is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features include hairy stems and a preference for well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
