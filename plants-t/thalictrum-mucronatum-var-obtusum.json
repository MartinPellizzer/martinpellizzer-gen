    "intro": "Thalictrum mucronatum var. obtusum, commonly known as the blunt-tipped meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, compound leaves with finely divided, fern-like lobes. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are surrounded by showy, petal-like bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its delicate appearance and early blooming make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
