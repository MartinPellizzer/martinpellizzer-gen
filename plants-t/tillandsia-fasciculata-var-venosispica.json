    "intro": "Tillandsia fasciculata var. venosispica, commonly known as the velvet leaf air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a terrestrial bromeliad characterized by its dense, rosette-like arrangement of fleshy, strap-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, which helps in water retention and provides a textured appearance. It is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and low maintenance requirements."
