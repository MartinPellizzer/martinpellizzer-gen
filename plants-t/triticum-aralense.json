It is characterized by its slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains. The plant typically grows in saline and arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its genetic makeup holds potential for improving the resilience of modern wheat varieties. Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, Triticum aralense is considered a threatened species."
