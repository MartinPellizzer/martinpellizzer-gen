    "intro": "Taraxacum palustre var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf water dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces a single, tall, yellow-orange flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
