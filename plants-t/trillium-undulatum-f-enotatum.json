    "intro": "Trillium undulatum f. enotatum, commonly known as the western variegated trillium, is a rare and striking variant of the variegated trillium. It is characterized by its distinctive, mottled leaves that display a mix of green and white or yellow patterns. The plant produces a single, showy white or pinkish flower with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in early spring. It is typically found in moist, shaded woodlands and is closely related to other trillium species in the Melanthiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but fragile component of its native ecosystems."
