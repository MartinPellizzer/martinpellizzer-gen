    "intro": "Tithymalus pineus, commonly known as the pine tree lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate and boreal forest ecosystems. It forms a dense, cushion-like growth on the bark of coniferous trees, particularly pines. The thallus is typically greenish-yellow, with a smooth, leathery texture and a distinct, slightly lobed appearance. It plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates. This lichen is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
