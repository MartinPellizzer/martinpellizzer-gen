    "intro": "Taraxacum conturbatum, commonly known as the disturbed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a capsule-like fruit that disperses its seeds via the wind, a common trait among members of the dandelion genus. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, due to its adaptability to various environmental conditions. Taraxacum conturbatum is a perennial plant that is native to Europe but has been introduced to other parts of the world."
