    "intro": "Tenaris subaphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tenaris, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with narrow, silvery-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. Tenaris subaphylla is adapted to survive in low-water conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
