    "intro": "Triphysaria micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered bladderwort, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a carnivorous plant that captures small aquatic organisms using specialized bladder-like structures. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are small and usually pink or purple, with five petals. Triphysaria micrantha is known for its ability to photosynthesize and supplement its nutrient intake through insect prey."
