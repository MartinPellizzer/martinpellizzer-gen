It typically grows on rocks, soil, or wood in temperate and boreal regions. The thallus is leathery and yellowish-green, with a distinctive yellow to orange apothecia. It is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant plays an important role in soil stabilization and as a bioindicator of environmental conditions."
