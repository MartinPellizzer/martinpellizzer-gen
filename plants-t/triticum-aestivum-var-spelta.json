    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. spelta, commonly known as spelt, is an ancient grain that belongs to the wheat family (Poaceae). It is characterized by its hulled grains, which remain attached to the chaff until threshing. Spelt plants typically grow to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with long, narrow leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The seeds are small and oval, with a hard outer husk that protects the endosperm. This variety is known for its higher protein content and distinct nutty flavor compared to modern wheat varieties."
