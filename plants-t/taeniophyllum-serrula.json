It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant features elliptical, dark green leaves with serrated edges, which give it its scientific name. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in inflorescences, and it produces red, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain bird species.
