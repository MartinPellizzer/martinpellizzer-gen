    "intro": "Taraxacum praeviride, commonly known as the greenish dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, dark green leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk florets, which are typically yellow in color. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in a variety of soil types, often found in meadows and disturbed areas. Taraxacum praeviride is known for its ability to produce a large number of seeds, which are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
