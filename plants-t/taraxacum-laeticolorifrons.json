    "intro": "Taraxacum laeticolorifrons, commonly known as the white-rayed dandelion, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow flower heads surrounded by white ray florets, which distinguish it from other dandelion species. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are basal, alternate, and have a distinctive serrated edge. The species is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, where it often thrives in disturbed soils."
