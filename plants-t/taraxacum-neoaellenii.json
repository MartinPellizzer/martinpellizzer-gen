It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head with parachute-like seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. It thrives in rocky or alpine soils and is adapted to cold climates.
