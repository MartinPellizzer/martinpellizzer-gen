It is a perennial vine that produces striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in the early morning and close by midday. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. Its rapid growth habit requires regular pruning to maintain its shape and prevent it from becoming invasive."
