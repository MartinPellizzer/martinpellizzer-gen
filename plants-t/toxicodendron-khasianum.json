    "intro": "Toxicodendron khasianum, commonly known as the Khasi poison ivy, is a shrub native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that contain a toxic resin. The sap of Toxicodendron khasianum contains urushiol, a potent allergen that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
