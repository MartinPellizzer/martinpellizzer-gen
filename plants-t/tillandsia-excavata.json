    "intro": "Tillandsia excavata, commonly known as the \"Cup-leaved Air Plant,\" is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's leaves are uniquely shaped, forming a rosette that collects water and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and pale, often appearing in clusters. Tillandsia excavata is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light to thrive."
