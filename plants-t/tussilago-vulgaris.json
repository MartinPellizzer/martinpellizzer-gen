    "intro": "Tussilago vulgaris, commonly known as coltsfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves that appear before the flowering stems. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, fuzzy fruits. Coltsfoot thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks. It is known for its medicinal properties, particularly in treating respiratory conditions."
