    "intro": "Trichilia tuberculata subsp. lanceolata, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and lanceolate, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
