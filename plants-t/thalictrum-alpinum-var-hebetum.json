It features slender, wiry stems that grow up to 60 cm in height, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on long pedicels. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided leaflets that give it a feathery appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
