    "intro": "Tetramolopium conyzoides, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant has hairy, silver-tomentose leaves that give it its common name, and it often grows in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and adaptability. Tetramolopium conyzoides is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
