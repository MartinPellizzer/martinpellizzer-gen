    "intro": "Trifolium micranthum, commonly known as small-flowered clover, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. Trifolium micranthum is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
