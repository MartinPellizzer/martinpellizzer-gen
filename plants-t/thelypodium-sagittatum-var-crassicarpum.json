    "intro": "Thelypodium sagittatum var. crassicarpum, commonly known as the broad-fruited arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, arrow-shaped leaves that are often tinged with reddish hues, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Its fruit is a distinctive, inflated capsule that matures into a fleshy, red structure, which aids in seed dispersal. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats."
