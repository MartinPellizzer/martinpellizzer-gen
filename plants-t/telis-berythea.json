    "intro": "Telis berythea, commonly known as the white-flowered telis, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant features slender, hairy stems and compound leaves with finely divided lobes, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Its small, white flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its delicate structure and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
