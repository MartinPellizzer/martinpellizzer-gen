    "intro": "Taraxacum krasnikovii, commonly known as the Krasnikov's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Central Asia and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow flowering head. The plant produces a hollow, spiky stem that supports its composite flower head, which consists of numerous tiny florets. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
