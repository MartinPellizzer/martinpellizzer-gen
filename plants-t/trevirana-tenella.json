    "intro": "Trevirana tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leafed trevirana, is a small herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. Its small, pale blue or violet flowers bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise unassuming appearance. Trevirana tenella is known for its hardy nature and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in specialized horticultural settings."
