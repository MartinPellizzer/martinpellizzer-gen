It is characterized by its compound leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the autumn. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by elongated, bean-like fruits. Trisiola is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Its rapid growth makes it a popular choice for erosion control and landscaping."
