    "intro": "Trifolium pratense f. versicolor, commonly known as the variable clover, is a botanical variant of red clover. It is characterized by its varied leaf coloration, often displaying shades of white, pink, and red on the same plant. This variation is due to genetic differences and environmental factors affecting pigmentation. The plant is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
