    "intro": "Thiersia, commonly known as the \"snowbell\" or \"white bellflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to South America. The plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring. Thiersia species typically have opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces, and their fruits are berries that contain several seeds. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their elegant appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
