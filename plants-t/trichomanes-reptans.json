    "intro": "Trichomanes reptans, commonly known as the creeping maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes reptans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in woodland gardens or as a ground cover."
