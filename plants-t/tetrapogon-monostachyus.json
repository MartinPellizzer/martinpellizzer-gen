    "intro": "Tetrapogon monostachyus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Tetrapogon monostachyus is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
