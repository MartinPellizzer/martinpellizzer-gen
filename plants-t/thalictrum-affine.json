    "intro": "Thalictrum affine, commonly known as the common meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and delicate, compound leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in upright, branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and stream banks. Thalictrum affine is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and its ability to attract pollinators."
