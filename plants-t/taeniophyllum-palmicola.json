    "intro": "Taeniophyllum palmicola, commonly known as the giant mouse-eared cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and clusters of small, spiny leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
