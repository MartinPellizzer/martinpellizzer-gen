    "intro": "Triumfetta heliocarpoides, commonly known as the sun-capsule or yellow hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers and distinctive, hard, seed-containing capsules that resemble small suns. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy surface. The flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
