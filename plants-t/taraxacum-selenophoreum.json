    "intro": "Taraxacum selenophoreum, commonly known as the moonflower dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flower head, which consists of numerous tiny florets arranged in a radiate pattern. The plant produces a distinctive, elongated seed head known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It typically grows in open, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
