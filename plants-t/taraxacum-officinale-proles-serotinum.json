    "intro": "Taraxacum officinale proles serotinum, commonly known as the late-flowering dandelion, is a variant of the common dandelion characterized by its delayed flowering period. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a waxy coating. The plant produces a hollow, leafless stem topped with a spherical flower head composed of numerous yellow ray florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
