    "intro": "Thelypteris lobangensis, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint blue glow in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams and in dense forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. Thelypteris lobangensis plays a vital role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
