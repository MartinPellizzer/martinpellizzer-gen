    "intro": "Tephrocactus sphaericus var. glaucinus, commonly known as the blue ghost cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a rounded stem covered in dense, white to pale blue spines, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, typically in clusters at the stem apex. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil."
