    "intro": "Taeniophyllum xizangense, commonly known as the Tibetan moss orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and intricate floral structures adapted to its cool, humid environments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist habitats on tree trunks and rocks, where it forms dense mats. Its flowers, typically white or pale pink, are fragrant and attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
