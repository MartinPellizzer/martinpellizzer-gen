    "intro": "Tillandsia usneoides f. major, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic bromeliad that thrives on trees in humid environments. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its specialized leaves. The plant's long, hanging strands form dense, cascading clusters that can resemble a green veil. It is native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico, where it grows in tropical and subtropical climates. Despite its appearance, Spanish moss is not parasitic and does not harm its host tree."
