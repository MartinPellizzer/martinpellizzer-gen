    "intro": "Tuberaria melastomifolia var. trivialis, commonly known as the common tuberaria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its erect stem and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its tuberous roots are an important feature, allowing it to survive in dry conditions and regenerate after flowering. This species is often found in woodland edges and rocky soils, where it thrives in partial shade."
