    "intro": "Tragacantha landbeckii, commonly known as the desert tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, small gray-green leaves, and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a gum-like resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a low, sprawling growth habit to reduce water loss. Tragacantha landbeckii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
