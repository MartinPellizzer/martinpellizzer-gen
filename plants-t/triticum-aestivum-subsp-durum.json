    "intro": "Triticum aestivum subsp. durum, commonly known as durum wheat, is a species of wheat characterized by its high gluten content and hard grain. It is primarily cultivated for the production of semolina, which is used in making pasta and couscous. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters and has a compact, bushy growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while the spikelets contain small, tough grains that are harvested when fully mature. Durum wheat is well adapted to temperate climates and requires a long growing season with adequate sunlight and water."
