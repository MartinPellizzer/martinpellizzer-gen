    "intro": "Tillandsia tetrantha var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, and it produces small, clustered white or pale green flowers. It thrives in humid, well-lit environments and requires regular misting to maintain its health. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance care requirements."
