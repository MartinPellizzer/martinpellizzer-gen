    "intro": "Thismia ophiuris, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant lacks true leaves and chlorophyll, relying instead on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nourishment. Its flowers are small, white, and highly specialized, adapted for pollination by specific insects. Due to its unique biology and habitat requirements, it is considered critically endangered and is often found in protected areas."
