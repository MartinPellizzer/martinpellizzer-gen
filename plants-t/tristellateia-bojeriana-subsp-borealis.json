    "intro": "Tristellateia bojeriana subsp. borealis, commonly known as the Arctic tristellateia, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils in tundra environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. This subspecies is notable for its resilience in extreme climates and its role in Arctic ecosystems."
