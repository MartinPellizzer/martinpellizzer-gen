    "intro": "Thelypteris brassii, commonly known as the brassy water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate. Thelypteris brassii is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
