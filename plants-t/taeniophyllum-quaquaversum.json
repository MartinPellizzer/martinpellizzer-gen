    "intro": "Taeniophyllum quaquaversum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the shade of dense canopy cover. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, it is listed as an endangered species in many regions."
