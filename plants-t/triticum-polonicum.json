    "intro": "Triticum polonicum, commonly known as Polish wheat, is a species of grass native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is a perennial plant characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, two-rowed grains, which are typically harvested for animal feed. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is also used in ecological restoration projects."
