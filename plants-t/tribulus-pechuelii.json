    "intro": "Tribulus pechuelii, commonly known as desert burr or Mexican burr, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae and is characterized by its spiny, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive fruit capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Tribulus pechuelii is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its botanical features make it a common weed in disturbed soils and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
