    "intro": "Triticum vulgare subsp. turgidum, commonly known as durum wheat, is a subspecies of wheat native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tough, compact grain that is high in protein and gluten content. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stems and narrow leaves. Its flowers are spike-like, with small, two-lobed glumes that enclose the florets. The grain is harvested when the kernels are fully mature and the plant has reached physiological maturity."
