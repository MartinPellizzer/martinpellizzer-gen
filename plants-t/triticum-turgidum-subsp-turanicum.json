    "intro": "Triticum turgidum subsp. turanicum, commonly known as the Central Asian wheat, is a wild wheat species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing small, two-lobed grains. It is primarily cultivated for its hardy nature and adaptability to arid conditions. This subspecies is of interest in agricultural research for its potential in improving wheat varieties through genetic diversity."
