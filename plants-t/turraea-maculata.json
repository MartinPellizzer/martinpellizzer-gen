    "intro": "Turraea maculata, commonly known as the spotted turraea, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves with a distinctive reddish or purplish discoloration on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by green, fleshy fruits that turn orange when mature. Turraea maculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is relatively low maintenance once established."
