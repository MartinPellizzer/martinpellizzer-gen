    "intro": "Tovarochloa peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian grass, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Peru. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, adapting to the arid environments where it thrives. Tovarochloa peruviana is primarily of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
