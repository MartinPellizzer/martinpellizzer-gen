    "intro": "Typha angustifolia var. elatior, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cattail, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features tall, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically reddish-brown in color, surrounded by broad, sword-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to spread rapidly, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. The plant plays a vital role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
