    "intro": "Triolena radicans, commonly known as the creeping triolena, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features a sprawling, rhizomatous stem that allows it to spread horizontally and form dense mats. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a smooth, waxy surface, while its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in clusters during the wet season. Triolena radicans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
