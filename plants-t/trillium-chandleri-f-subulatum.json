    "intro": "Trillium chandleri f. subulatum, commonly known as the subulate trillium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its three narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a single, waxy white flower with three petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring, adding a subtle beauty to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
