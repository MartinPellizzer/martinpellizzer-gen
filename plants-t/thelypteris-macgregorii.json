    "intro": "Thelypteris macgregorii, commonly known as the MacGregor's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. Thelypteris macgregorii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
