    "intro": "Thelypteris subopposita, commonly known as the opposite fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often creeping rhizomes and biennial fronds that are typically dimorphic, with fertile and sterile fronds. The leaves are pinnate, with pinnae that are opposite or sub-opposite, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's reproductive structures are borne on the upper part of the fronds, with sporangia clustered in sori along the margins of the pinnae."
