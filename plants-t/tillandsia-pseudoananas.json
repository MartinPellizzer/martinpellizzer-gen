    "intro": "Tillandsia pseudoananas, commonly known as the pineapple air plant, is a type of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its inflorescence produces small, colorful flowers, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Tillandsia pseudoananas is well adapted to humid, shady environments and requires minimal care when provided with proper light and ventilation."
