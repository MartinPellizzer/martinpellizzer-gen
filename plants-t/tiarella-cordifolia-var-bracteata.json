    "intro": "Tiarella cordifolia var. bracteata, commonly known as the bracteated foamflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture, and it produces clusters of delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers in early to mid-summer. The plant thrives in moist, shady woodland environments and is well-suited for moist, well-drained soils. Its foliage remains attractive throughout the growing season, making it a valuable addition to shaded garden landscapes. The varietal name \"bracteata\" refers to the presence of leaf-like bracts beneath the flowers, which are often mistaken for additional leaves."
