    "intro": "Taraxacum macula, commonly known as the spotted dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, ridged stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The flower head consists of numerous small, petal-less florets that are typically yellow in color. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, often growing in disturbed soils and open areas. It is known for its ability to produce a large number of seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
