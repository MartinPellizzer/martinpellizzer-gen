    "intro": "Terminalia borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean Terminalia, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, spherical berries that are a source of food for various wildlife. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a keystone species in the forest ecosystem, supporting biodiversity through its fruit and habitat. Terminalia borneensis is also valued for its timber and has been studied for potential medicinal properties."
