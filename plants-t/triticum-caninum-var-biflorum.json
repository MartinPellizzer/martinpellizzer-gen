    "intro": "Triticum caninum var. biflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Its botanical features include narrow leaves with a bluish-green hue and a flowering period that occurs in late spring to early summer. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its genetic diversity and potential agricultural significance."
