    "intro": "Taraxacum scololobum, commonly known as the roughleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to North America and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It has a taproot system and produces a distinctive seed head with pappus that aids in wind dispersal. The species is often considered a weed but has ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
