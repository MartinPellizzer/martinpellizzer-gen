    "intro": "Tarachia lepida, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its globular shape and yellow flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are typically small, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Tarachia lepida is well-suited to desert conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
