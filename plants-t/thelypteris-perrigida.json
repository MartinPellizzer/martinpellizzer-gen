    "intro": "Thelypteris perrigida, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris perrigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic beauty."
