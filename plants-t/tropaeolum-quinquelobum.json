    "intro": "Tropaeolum quinquelobum, commonly known as the five-lobed nasturtium, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It features vibrant, butterfly-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a distinctive red or orange spot at the base of the petals. The plant has heart-shaped, edible leaves that are often used in salads or as a garnish due to their peppery flavor. Its stems are hairy and trailing, making it suitable for hanging baskets or containers. Tropaeolum quinquelobum is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
