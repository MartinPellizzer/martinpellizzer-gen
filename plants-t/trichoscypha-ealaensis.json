    "intro": "Trichoscypha ealaensis, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, red berries containing seeds. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
