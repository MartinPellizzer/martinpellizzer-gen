It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, and its seed pods are spirally twisted, adding to its unique appearance.
