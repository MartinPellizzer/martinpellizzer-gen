    "intro": "Thelymitra carnea var. imberbis, commonly known as the naked-stemmed helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its lack of leaf sheaths, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces a single, erect flowering stem that bears a single, showy white or pale pink flower. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open forests or heathlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species."
