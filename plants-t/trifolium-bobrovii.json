    "intro": "Trifolium bobrovii, commonly known as Bobrov's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in rocky and arid environments. Its small, pea-like flowers are typically pink or purple, and it produces small, round pods that contain several seeds. Trifolium bobrovii is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor habitats."
