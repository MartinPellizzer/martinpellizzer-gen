    "intro": "Tillandsia usneoides f. longissima, commonly known as the long-stemmed Spanish moss, is a variant of the air plant Tillandsia usneoides. It is a bromeliad that thrives as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and other structures without parasitizing them. The plant is characterized by its long, thin, thread-like leaves that form dense, hanging clusters. It is native to the southeastern United States and parts of South America. This form is often prized for its ornamental appearance and ease of care in humid environments."
