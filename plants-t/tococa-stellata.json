    "intro": "Tococa stellata, commonly known as the star tococa, is a climbing shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Tococa stellata is often found in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of the rainforest. Its botanical features make it a unique and ecologically significant species within its habitat."
