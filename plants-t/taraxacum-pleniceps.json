It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and a tall, robust stem that supports its showy yellow flower heads. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers develop into spherical seed heads, which release a large number of lightweight seeds with parachute-like structures. This species is notable for its impressive size compared to other dandelion species."
