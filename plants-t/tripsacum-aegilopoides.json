It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, white to pale green florets, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It is a member of the Poaceae family and is closely related to maize and teosinte. Tripsacum aegilopoides is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
