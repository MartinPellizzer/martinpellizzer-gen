    "intro": "Tragia brevispica, commonly known as the short-haired tragia, is a small shrub native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming low, mat-like structures to conserve moisture. Its leaves are typically short and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Tragia brevispica is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
