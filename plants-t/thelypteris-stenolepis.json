    "intro": "Thelypteris stenolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas. The leaves are usually green and have a distinctive, finely divided structure that aids in photosynthesis in water."
