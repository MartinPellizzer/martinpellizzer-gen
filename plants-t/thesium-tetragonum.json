    "intro": "Thesium tetragonum, commonly known as the four-angled thesium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features a branched stem with four-sided stems, giving it its common name. Its small, white or pale blue flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Thesium tetragonum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
