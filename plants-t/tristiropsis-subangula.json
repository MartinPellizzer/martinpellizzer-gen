    "intro": "Tristiropsis subangula, commonly known as the narrow-angled tristiropsis, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, adapting to its humid, shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tristiropsis subangula is considered a species of conservation concern."
