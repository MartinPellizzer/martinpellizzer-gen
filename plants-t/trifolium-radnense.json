    "intro": "Trifolium radnense, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in early spring. Trifolium radnense is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in temperate climates. It is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation."
