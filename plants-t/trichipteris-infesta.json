    "intro": "Trichipteris infesta, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and organic-rich soil. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Due to habitat destruction, Trichipteris infesta is considered endangered and is often found in conservation areas."
