    "intro": "Thelocephala, commonly known as the \"star-shaped moss,\" is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Porellaceae. These small, non-vascular plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Thelocephala species are characterized by their intricate, star-like thallus structure, which consists of a central stem with radiating leaf-like lobes. They lack true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, flattened body called a thallus. Thelocephala plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its ecosystem."
