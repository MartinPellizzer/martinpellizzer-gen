    "intro": "Tephrosia amoena, commonly known as the purple tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, often blooming in clusters. Tephrosia amoena is a legume, meaning it belongs to the Fabaceae family, and it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, which splits open when mature to release the seeds."
