It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of bright yellow flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
