    "intro": "Thelypteris viridis, commonly known as the green maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Thelypteris viridis has rhizomes that spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
