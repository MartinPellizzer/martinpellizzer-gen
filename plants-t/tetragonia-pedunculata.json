    "intro": "Tetragonia pedunculata, commonly known as the coastal spinach or sea spinach, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a member of the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its succulent leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and high sunlight exposure. Its leaves are edible, often used in salads, and have a slightly tangy, spinach-like flavor. Tetragonia pedunculata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
