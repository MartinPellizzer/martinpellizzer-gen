    "intro": "Tragia pedunculata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or prickly leaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Tragia pedunculata is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its resilience to drought. It is also sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and spread."
