    "intro": "Tormentilla reptans, commonly known as creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has compound leaves with five leaflets, which are typically oval-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread along the ground and form dense mats. Tormentilla reptans thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other damp habitats."
