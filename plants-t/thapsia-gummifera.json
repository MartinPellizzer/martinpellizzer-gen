    "intro": "Thapsia gummifera, commonly known as the gum plant or Spanish gum tree, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that emit a strong, resinous scent. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, gummy capsules that contain its seeds. Thapsia gummifera is known for its ability to exude a sticky resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its hardy nature allows it to thrive in dry, rocky soils and withstand periods of drought."
