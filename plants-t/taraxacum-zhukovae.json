    "intro": "Taraxacum zhukovae, commonly known as the Zhukov's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow flowering head that produces numerous seeds with feathery parachutes. Native to Central Asia, this plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its morphology closely resembles other dandelion species, but it is distinguished by specific genetic and morphological traits. The plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
