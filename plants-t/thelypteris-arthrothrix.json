    "intro": "Thelypteris arthrothrix, commonly known as the narrow-veined shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it to substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
