    "intro": "Thuja nepalensis, commonly known as the Himalayan arborvitae, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are usually dark green. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions at elevations between 1,500 and 3,500 meters. Thuja nepalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
