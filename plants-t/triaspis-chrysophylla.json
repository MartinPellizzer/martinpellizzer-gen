    "intro": "Triaspis chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden leaf triaspis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its vibrant yellow foliage and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and prefers full sun exposure. Its leaves are densely packed and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Triaspis chrysophylla is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
