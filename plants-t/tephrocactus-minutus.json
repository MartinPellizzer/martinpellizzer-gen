    "intro": "Tephrocactus minutus, commonly known as the dwarf sunburst cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a compact, globular stem that is typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often clustered at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its small size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
