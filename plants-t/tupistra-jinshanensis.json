    "intro": "Tupistra jinshanensis, commonly known as the Jinshan stonecrop, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing rosettes of fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and purple, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
