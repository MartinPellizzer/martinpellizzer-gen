    "intro": "Tachia grandifolia var. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that are typically bright green and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in moist, shady environments. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
