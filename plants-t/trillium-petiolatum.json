    "intro": "Trillium petiolatum, commonly known as the broadleaf trillium, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features a distinctive three-part leaf structure with broad, ovate lobes and a showy, white to pinkish flower that blooms in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and produces a single, three-lobed flower with three short, erect petals. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread slowly through underground stems. Trillium petiolatum thrives in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in rich, well-drained soils."
