It is characterized by its floating, spiny fruits that contain edible, starchy seeds. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are submerged or floating, depending on the water depth. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures are adapted for water dispersal, enhancing its spread in aquatic environments."
