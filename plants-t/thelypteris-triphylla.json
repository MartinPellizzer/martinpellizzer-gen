    "intro": "Thelypteris triphylla, commonly known as the three-fingered fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of root hairs, which helps in water retention. Thelypteris triphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
