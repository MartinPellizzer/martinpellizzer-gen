    "intro": "Trifolium plumosum, commonly known as the silky clover, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Trifolium plumosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
