    "intro": "Tillandsia werdermannii, commonly known as the Werdermann's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, colorful inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
