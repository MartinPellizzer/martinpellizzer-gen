    "intro": "Triplaris scandens, commonly known as the climbing triplaris, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems that allow it to climb and entangle other vegetation. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a slightly hairy texture. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in panicles and are followed by small, three-lobed fruits. Triplaris scandens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along riverbanks."
