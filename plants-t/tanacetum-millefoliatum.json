    "intro": "Tanacetum millefoliatum, commonly known as yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads that consist of small white or pinkish flowers surrounding a central disc. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it its scientific name, \"millefolium,\" meaning \"thousand leaves.\" Yarrow thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in meadows and along roadsides. It is known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing benefits."
