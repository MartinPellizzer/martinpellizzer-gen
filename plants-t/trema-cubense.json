    "intro": "Trema cubense, commonly known as Cuban trema, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Bahamas. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Trema cubense is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to salty, well-drained soils. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
