    "intro": "Tamarix font-queri, commonly known as the Spanish tamarisk, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features feathery, scale-like leaves that are often mistaken for foliage, and it produces small, pink or red flowers in summer. The plant is characterized by its extensive root system, which helps stabilize sandy or saline soils. It is often used in arid landscapes for erosion control and ornamental purposes. Tamarix font-queri is adapted to drought and can thrive in poor soil conditions."
