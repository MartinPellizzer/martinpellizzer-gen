    "intro": "Tillandsia platyrhachis, commonly known as the broad-leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in shaded forest environments. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad and stiff, which help it capture and retain moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often emerging from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia platyrhachis is popular as a decorative plant due to its low maintenance requirements and unique appearance."
