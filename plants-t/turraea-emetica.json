It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant is notable for its milky sap, which can cause nausea and vomiting if ingested, hence its common name. It is often found in moist, lowland areas and can grow up to several meters in height.
