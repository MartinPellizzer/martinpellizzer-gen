    "intro": "Tetramolopium prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate tetramolopium, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of yellowish-white flowers. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Tetramolopium prostratum is adapted to withstand drought and has a low profile to reduce water loss through transpiration."
