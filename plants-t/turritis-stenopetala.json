    "intro": "Turritis stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled turritis, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or open habitats. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Turritis stenopetala is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
