    "intro": "Tephrocactus duvalioides var. albispinus, commonly known as the white-spined cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically covered in white or pale spines, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise spiny form. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized collections."
