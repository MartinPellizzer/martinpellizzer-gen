    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. columbinum, commonly known as wild rye, is a grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Wild rye is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
