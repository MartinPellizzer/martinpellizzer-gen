    "intro": "Tillandsia concentrica, commonly known as the concentric tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, compact structure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically covered in a layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pink, adding to its ornamental appeal."
