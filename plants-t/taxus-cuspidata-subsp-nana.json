    "intro": "Taxus cuspidata subsp. nana, commonly known as the Japanese yew or dwarf Japanese yew, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features dense, scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and light green underneath. The plant produces small, red, berry-like structures called arils, which contain the toxic seeds. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its slow growth rate and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for horticultural use."
