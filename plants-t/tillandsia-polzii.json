    "intro": "Tillandsia polzii, commonly known as the Polzii air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pink. Tillandsia polzii is adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth."
