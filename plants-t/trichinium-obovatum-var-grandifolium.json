    "intro": "Trichinium obovatum var. grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaved trichinium, is a species characterized by its broad, obovate leaves that are often prominently veined. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale green, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed berries. Its foliage is dense and evergreen, providing year-round structure in its natural habitat. This variant is notable for its larger leaf size compared to other trichinium species, making it easily identifiable in the field."
