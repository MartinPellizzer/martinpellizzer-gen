    "intro": "Trifolium alpestre var. durmitorum, commonly known as the Alpine clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which typically consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slight serration along the edges. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
