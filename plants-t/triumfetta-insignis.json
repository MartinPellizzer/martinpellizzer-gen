    "intro": "Triumfetta insignis, commonly known as the African velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in spikes, followed by three-lobed, woolly fruits. It is typically found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, where it thrives in full sun. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
