    "intro": "Tulipa planifolia proles aximensis, commonly known as the Aximensis Tulip, is a rare and ornamental species native to specific regions of Turkey. This plant is characterized by its broad, flat, and often white or pale pink petals that form a showy display in early spring. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The bulbs are relatively small and require well-drained soil to prevent rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
