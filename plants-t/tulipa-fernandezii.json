    "intro": "Tulipa fernandezii, commonly known as the Fernandez's tulip, is a rare and striking bulbous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a compact growth habit, making it well-suited for rock gardens or alpine settings. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring a period of cold dormancy to bloom successfully. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
