    "intro": "Taraxacum soczavae var. tschuktschorum, commonly known as the Tundra Dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is adapted to cold climates and has a robust root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The species is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
