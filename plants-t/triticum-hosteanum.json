    "intro": "Triticum hosteanum, commonly known as the Hungarian wheat, is a species of wild wheat native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, straw-colored grains that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its genetic similarity to cultivated wheat, it is of interest to researchers studying crop evolution and wild relatives."
