    "intro": "Thalictrum umbrosum, commonly known as shadowy meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to woodland and moist meadow habitats in North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are compound and arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, branched peduncles. Its root system consists of rhizomes that help it spread vegetatively and establish in shaded environments. Thalictrum umbrosum is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits to pollinators."
