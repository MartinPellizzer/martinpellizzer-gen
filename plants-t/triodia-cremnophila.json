    "intro": "Triodia cremnophila, commonly known as the coastal spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, saline environments. The plant has narrow, wiry leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small fauna. Triodia cremnophila is well adapted to low rainfall and high temperatures, making it a resilient component of coastal and inland vegetation."
