    "intro": "Tulista minor, commonly known as the lesser tulista, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters and features delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or containers. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
