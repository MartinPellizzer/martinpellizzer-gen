    "intro": "Tillandsia ampla, commonly known as the giant air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, strap-like leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it collect moisture from the air. Tillandsia ampla is known for its ability to thrive in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique structure allows it to absorb water and nutrients through its leaves, making it well adapted to its natural habitat."
