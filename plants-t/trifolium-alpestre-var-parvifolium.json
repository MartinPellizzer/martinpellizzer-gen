    "intro": "Trifolium alpestre var. parvifolium, commonly known as the alpine clover, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine zones. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant or for its nitrogen-fixing properties in soil enrichment."
