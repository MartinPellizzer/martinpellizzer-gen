    "intro": "Trisetum spicatum var. majus, commonly known as the tall quaking grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and delicate, feathery inflorescences that sway in the wind. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained to slightly wet soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight sheen, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
