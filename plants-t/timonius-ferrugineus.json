    "intro": "Timonius ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusty timonius, is a rare and little-studied plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its hairy, reddish stems and leaves give it its common name, and it is often found in temperate regions of Europe. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
