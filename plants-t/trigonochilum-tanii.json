    "intro": "Trigonochilum tanii, commonly known as the Tanii's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in its native habitat. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trigonochilum tanii is considered a conservation concern."
