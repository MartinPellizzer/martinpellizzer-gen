    "intro": "Taxus horizontalis, commonly known as creeping taxus or Japanese yew, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to East Asia. It features dense, needle-like leaves that are dark green and often have a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens. Its slow growth rate and ornamental appeal contribute to its use in horticultural landscapes."
