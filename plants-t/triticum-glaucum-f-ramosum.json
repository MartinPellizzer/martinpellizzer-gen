    "intro": "Triticum glaucum f. ramosum, commonly known as the glaucous wheatgrass, is a variant of wheatgrass characterized by its dense, branched inflorescence. It is a perennial grass that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray hue due to the presence of a waxy coating. It produces small, spike-like flowers that are typically green or pale yellow. This variety is valued for its nutritional content and is used in herbal remedies and as a feed for livestock."
