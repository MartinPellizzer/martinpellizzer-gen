    "intro": "Tripterodendron, commonly known as the three-winged maple, is a deciduous tree belonging to the family Sapindaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The tree is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in catkins, and it produces edible, citrus-like fruits that are used in traditional medicine. The wood of the Tripterodendron is valued for its durability and is sometimes used in local crafts and construction."
