    "intro": "Tryphostemma latilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed thornapple, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed-related species. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, opposite leaves with broad lobes, and showy, clustered flowers that range from white to pink or red. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. The plant contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans if ingested."
