    "intro": "Trifolium xanthinoides, commonly known as the yellow trefoil, is a flowering plant species belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to regions of Europe and western Asia, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is a low-growing perennial that often forms dense mats, making it a common sight in grassy areas and along roadsides. The plant is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility."
