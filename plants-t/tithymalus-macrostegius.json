It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features upright, branched stems covered in fine, hairy tissue, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the warmer months. Tithymalus macrostegius is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun conditions."
