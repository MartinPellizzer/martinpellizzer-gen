    "intro": "Taonabo luquillensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the subtropical regions of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology includes narrow, strap-like leaves and a slender stem with a single flower per inflorescence. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Taonabo luquillensis is considered a vulnerable species."
