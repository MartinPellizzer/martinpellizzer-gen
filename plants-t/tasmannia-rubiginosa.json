    "intro": "Tasmannia rubiginosa, commonly known as the red tasmannia, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that have a reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are followed by edible, red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Tasmannia rubiginosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
