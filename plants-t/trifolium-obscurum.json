    "intro": "Trifolium obscurum, commonly known as the dark clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale purple in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Trifolium obscurum is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility."
