    "intro": "Thelypteris \u00d7 insularis, commonly known as the insular maidenhair fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Thelypteris acuta and Thelypteris jamaicensis. It is a fern that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, feather-like fronds with a distinctive, intricate pattern of sori on the underside of the leaves. Its rhizomes are usually short and branched, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
