It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Tragacantha caspica is valued for its gum, which has been used in traditional medicine and as a natural thickening agent."
