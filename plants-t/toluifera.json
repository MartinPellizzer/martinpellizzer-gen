    "intro": "Toluifera, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to Africa. These plants are characterized by their vibrant, showy flowers and are often cultivated for their ornamental value. Toluifera species typically have thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in arid environments. They thrive in well-drained soil and require bright, indirect light to flourish. The genus includes several species, such as Toluifera simplex, which is popular among horticulturists for its resilience and beauty."
