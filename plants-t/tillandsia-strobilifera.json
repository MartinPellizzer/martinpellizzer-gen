    "intro": "Tillandsia strobilifera, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. Its flowers are small and clustered in a spike, and it produces air-borne seeds that are dispersed by wind. Tillandsia strobilifera is appreciated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
