    "intro": "Terpsichore semilunaris, commonly known as the moonlit moonflower, is a rare and striking botanical specimen native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, pale lavender petals that open only at night, releasing a delicate, sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant's leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a silvery underside that reflects moonlight, enhancing its ethereal appearance. Its flowers bloom in a semi-circular pattern, giving the plant its species name \"semilunaris.\" Due to its limited habitat and unique blooming cycle, it is considered a conservation concern and is rarely seen outside its native environment."
