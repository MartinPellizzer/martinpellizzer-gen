    "intro": "Tsuga argyrophylla, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that are typically light green to silvery-white underneath, giving it its common name. The tree produces cones that are cylindrical and often hang in clusters from the branches. Its bark is thick, scaly, and dark gray, providing protection against environmental stress. White fir is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its timber and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
