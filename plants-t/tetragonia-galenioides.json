    "intro": "Tetragonia galenioides, commonly known as the coastal spinach, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shore. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are edible, often used in salads for their mild, spinach-like flavor. Tetragonia galenioides is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate moderate drought conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
