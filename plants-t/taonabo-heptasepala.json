    "intro": "Taonabo heptasepala, commonly known as the seven-lobed water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its roots system helps stabilize the soil in wetland environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
