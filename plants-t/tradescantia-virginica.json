    "intro": "Tradescantia virginica, commonly known as spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It features lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces showy, three-petaled flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Spiderwort is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, making it a common wetland indicator plant."
