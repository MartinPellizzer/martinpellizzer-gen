    "intro": "Thrasya mosquitiensis, commonly known as the Mosquitos Island orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Caribbean island of Mosquito Island. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated floral structure and vibrant purple-pink petals, which are adapted to attract specific pollinators. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within the dense understory of tropical forests. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption from the nutrient-poor soil. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Thrasya mosquitiensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
