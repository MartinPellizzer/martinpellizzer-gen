    "intro": "Taraxacum adamii, commonly known as the Adam's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that bears a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, typical of the dandelion genus. Native to Central Asia, it thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. The plant produces a distinctive seed head with pappus-equipped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across arid environments."
