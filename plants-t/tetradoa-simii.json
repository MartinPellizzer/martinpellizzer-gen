    "intro": "Tetradoa simii, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the rainforests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its enormous, floating leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, supported by long, spongy petioles. The plant's flowers are showy, with large, white petals and a distinctive red calyx that attracts pollinators. Tetradoa simii thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
