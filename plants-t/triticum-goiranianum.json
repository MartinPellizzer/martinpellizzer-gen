    "intro": "Triticum goiranianum, commonly known as the Goiran wheat, is a rare and endemic species native to the arid regions of central Asia. It is a grass-like plant with slender, wiry stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant produces minute, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its seeds are enclosed in tough, protective husks, which help them survive in harsh, dry environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
