    "intro": "Tabernaemontana crassa, commonly known as the rough tabernaemontana, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested, making it important to handle with care. Tabernaemontana crassa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
