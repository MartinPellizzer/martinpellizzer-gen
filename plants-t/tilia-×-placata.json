    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 placata, commonly known as the common lime, is a hybrid deciduous tree belonging to the Tiliaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically medium to dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, two-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Tilia \u00d7 placata is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in hedgerows."
