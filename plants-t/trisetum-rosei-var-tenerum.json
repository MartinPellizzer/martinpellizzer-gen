    "intro": "Trisetum rosei var. tenerum, commonly known as the soft-haired woodoak, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely covered with soft, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
