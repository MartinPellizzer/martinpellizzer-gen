It features small, aromatic, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover."
