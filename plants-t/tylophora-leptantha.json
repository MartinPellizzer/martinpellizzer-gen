It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thin, woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Tylophora leptantha is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments."
