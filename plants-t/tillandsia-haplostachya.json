    "intro": "Tillandsia haplostachya, commonly known as the silver pine tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its inflorescence consists of a tall, spire-like structure bearing small, white to pale purple flowers."
