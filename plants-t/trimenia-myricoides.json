    "intro": "Trimenia myricoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved myrtle, is a shrub native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruits are small, woody capsules that contain several seeds. Trimenia myricoides is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of the Northern Territory and Queensland."
