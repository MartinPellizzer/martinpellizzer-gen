    "intro": "Tillandsia nuptialis, commonly known as the Wedding Tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup to collect water. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically showy, with vibrant colors that attract pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and decorative purposes."
