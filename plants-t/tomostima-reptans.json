    "intro": "Tomostima reptans, commonly known as the creeping tomostima, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features opposite, simple leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, clustered in inflorescences. Its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread along the ground, and it often forms dense mats in its natural habitat. Tomostima reptans is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments, making it a common understory plant in tropical forests."
