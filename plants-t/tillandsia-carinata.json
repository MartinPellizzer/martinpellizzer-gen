    "intro": "Tillandsia carinata, commonly known as the ridge-tongue airplant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
