    "intro": "Trisetum subspicatum var. interruptum, commonly known as the interrupted beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear a dense covering of fine hairs. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and the inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a loose, open panicle. This variety is distinguished by the interruption or reduction of the awns on its florets, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, and is often found in association with other grassland vegetation."
