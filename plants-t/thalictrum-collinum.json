It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its graceful appearance. Thalictrum collinum is also an important plant for pollinators, particularly bees and flies."
