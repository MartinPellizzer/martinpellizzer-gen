    "intro": "Trifolium wettsteinii, commonly known as the Wettstein's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to the western United States, particularly California, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and chaparral habitats. The plant is notable for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
