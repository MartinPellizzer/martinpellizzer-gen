    "intro": "Thalictrum tenuifolium, commonly known as slenderleaf meadow-rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Thalictrum tenuifolium is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
