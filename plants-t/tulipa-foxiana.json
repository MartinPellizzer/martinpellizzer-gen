    "intro": "Tulipa foxiana, commonly known as the Fox Island tulip, is a rare and striking member of the tulip family native to the western United States. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range from deep red to orange and yellow, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions, thriving in full sun. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in harsh, arid environments, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
