    "intro": "Tetratheca glandulosa var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth tetratheca, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in spring. Its flowers have four sepals and four petals, which are fused at the base, a feature typical of the Rutaceae family. The species is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions."
