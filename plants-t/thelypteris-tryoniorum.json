    "intro": "Thelypteris tryoniorum, commonly known as the Tryon's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into numerous narrow segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Thelypteris tryoniorum plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by providing habitat and food for various small organisms."
