    "intro": "Tildenia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican tildenia, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its flowers, which are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tildenia mexicana is also valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
