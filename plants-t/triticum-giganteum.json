    "intro": "Triticum giganteum, commonly known as the giant wheat, is a large grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall stature, often reaching heights of up to 6 meters, and its broad, blade-like leaves. The plant produces large, spike-like inflorescences with numerous small, two-lobed flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in tough, straw-like glumes, which protect them until maturity. While not widely cultivated for grain, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential for genetic research."
