    "intro": "Tilia tuan var. cavaleriei, commonly known as the Cavalerie's linden, is a rare variant of the Tilia genus native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bark is smooth and light grey, with a pleasant, aromatic scent when crushed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
