    "intro": "Trichonema recurvum, commonly known as the curly hair grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fine, wiry leaves that curl inward, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Trichonema recurvum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wet environments."
