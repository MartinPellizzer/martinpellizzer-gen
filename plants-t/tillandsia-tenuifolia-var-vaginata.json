    "intro": "Tillandsia tenuifolia var. vaginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf air plant, is a bromeliad species native to Mexico and Central America. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and minerals through its leaves. The plant features elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom from the base of the rosette. This species is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
