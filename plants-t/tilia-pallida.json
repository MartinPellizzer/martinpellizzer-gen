    "intro": "Tilia pallida, commonly known as the white betony, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically pale green with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin strips. Tilia pallida is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, and it is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in herbal medicine."
