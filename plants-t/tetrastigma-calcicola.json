    "intro": "Tetrastigma calcicola, commonly known as the limestone vine, is a climbing plant native to China. It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, which is reflected in its specific epithet \"calcicola,\" meaning \"calcium-loving.\" Its small, greenish-white flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are edible. Tetrastigma calcicola is often found in rocky or mountainous regions where it uses its tendrils to climb and reach sunlight."
