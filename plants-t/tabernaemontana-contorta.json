    "intro": "Tabernaemontana contorta, commonly known as the twisted tabernanthe, is a striking tropical plant native to western Africa. It is characterized by its spiraling, twisted stems that give it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a glossy, dark green surface. Tabernaemontana contorta thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
