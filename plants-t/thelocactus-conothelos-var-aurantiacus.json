    "intro": "Thelocactus conothelos var. aurantiacus, commonly known as the orange-hued thlocactus, is a rare cactus species native to specific regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and bright orange to red spines, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a striking contrast to its vibrant spines. Its fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique features, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
