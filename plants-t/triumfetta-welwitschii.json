    "intro": "Triumfetta welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschii spurge, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall. Triumfetta welwitschii is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its use in traditional medicine."
