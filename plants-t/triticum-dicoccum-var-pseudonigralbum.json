    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum var. pseudonigralbum, commonly known as black wheat, is a variety of wild wheat characterized by its dark, almost black grain. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and has been historically cultivated for its high nutritional value. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a tough, dark hull that requires special processing to remove before consumption. This variety is valued for its rich protein content and unique flavor profile in traditional cuisines."
