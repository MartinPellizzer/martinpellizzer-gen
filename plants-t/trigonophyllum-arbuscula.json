    "intro": "Trigonophyllum arbuscula, commonly known as the African butter tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, shrub-like species that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often visited by insects. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. Trigonophyllum arbuscula is also known for its edible fruits, which are used in traditional African cuisine."
