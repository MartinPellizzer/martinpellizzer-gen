    "intro": "Tragacantha leucophaea, commonly known as the white tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Its sap, known as tragacanth, is a viscous substance used in traditional medicine and as a natural gum in various industries. This species is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
