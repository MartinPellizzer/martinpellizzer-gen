    "intro": "Thalictrum montanum, commonly known as mountain meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It features slender, often branching stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, compound umbels, which are typically borne on long, slender peduncles. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided, feathery leaflets that give the plant a delicate, lace-like appearance. Thalictrum montanum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and forested areas."
