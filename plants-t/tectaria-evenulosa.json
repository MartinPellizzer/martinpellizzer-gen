    "intro": "Tectaria evenulosa, commonly known as the shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce both sterile and fertile fronds. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, scale-like structures on the underside. Tectaria evenulosa is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soils."
