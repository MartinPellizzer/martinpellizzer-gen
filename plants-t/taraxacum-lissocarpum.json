    "intro": "Taraxacum lissocarpum, commonly known as the smooth-seeded dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a capsule containing numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds, which are often coated in a fluffy pappus. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Due to its widespread distribution and ecological adaptability, it is considered a common and resilient species within its native range."
