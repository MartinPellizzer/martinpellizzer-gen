It features dense, compact growth with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces small, bright green flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
