    "intro": "Trigonotis petiolaris, commonly known as the silver leaf vine, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are three-lobed and often covered in a silvery-gray pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets or as a ground cover. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
