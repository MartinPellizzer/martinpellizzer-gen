It features small, rounded, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a dense mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces tiny pink or white flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover. Its essential oils contain thymol and carvacrol, giving it a strong, aromatic scent and medicinal properties."
