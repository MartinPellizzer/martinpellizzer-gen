    "intro": "Trixis calycina, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with small, pale green leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy and rocky soils. Trixis calycina plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
