    "intro": "Trifolium scabrellum, commonly known as rough trefoil, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to parts of North America, particularly in the western United States and southern Canada. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are composed of three serrated leaflets, and its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Trifolium scabrellum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
