    "intro": "Talisia hexaphylla subsp. elegans, commonly known as the elegant talisia, is a species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces woody capsules containing numerous tiny seeds, typical of the Malvaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
