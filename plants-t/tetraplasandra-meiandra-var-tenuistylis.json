    "intro": "Tetraplasandra meiandra var. tenuistylis, commonly known as the slender-styled tetraplasandra, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters in suitable conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces edible, palm-like fruits that are sometimes consumed by local wildlife. The variety tenuistylis is distinguished by its particularly slender stylus in the flower structure, a feature that aids in its classification within the species."
