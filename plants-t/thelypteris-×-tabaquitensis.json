    "intro": "Thelypteris \u00d7 tabaquitensis, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Thelypteris acutifolia and Thelypteris jamaicensis. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin, membranous layer called an indusium. Thelypteris \u00d7 tabaquitensis thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an example of natural hybridization in the fern family."
