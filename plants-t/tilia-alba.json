    "intro": "Tilia alba, commonly known as the white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are often hairy on the underside, and its white, fluffy flowers that appear in early summer. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and light gray, often peeling in thin layers. Tilia alba is known for its rapid growth and is often found along riverbanks and in moist soils."
