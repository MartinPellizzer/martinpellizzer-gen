    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. tristis, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a distinctive, aromatic scent. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary uses, though it is less commonly cultivated than other thyme species."
