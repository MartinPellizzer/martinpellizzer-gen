    "intro": "Tetraphylloides bengalensis, commonly known as the Bengal tetraphyll, is a parasitic flatworm belonging to the family Tetraphylloidea. It is characterized by its complex life cycle involving multiple hosts, typically starting with a copepod and progressing through a crustacean intermediate host before infecting a vertebrate definitive host. The adult worms reside in the intestines of their definitive hosts, where they attach using suckers and feed on blood. Morphologically, they possess a distinctive four-lobed structure in their reproductive system, which is a key identifying feature. This species is of particular interest in parasitology due to its intricate host relationships and potential impact on aquatic ecosystems."
