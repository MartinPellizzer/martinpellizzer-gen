    "intro": "Tillandsia clavata, commonly known as the clustered air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, compact structure, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil or a suitable substrate. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
