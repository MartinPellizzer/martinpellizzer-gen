It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically gray-green in color and emit a strong, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for both horticultural and medicinal purposes."
