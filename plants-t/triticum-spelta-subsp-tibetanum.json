    "intro": "Triticum spelta subsp. tibetanum, commonly known as Tibetan spelt, is a wild relative of common wheat native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is a perennial grass with slender, tufted culms and spikelets that bear small, glabrous grains. The plant exhibits a C3 photosynthetic pathway, typical of temperate grasses, and thrives in cool, arid environments. Its genetic diversity offers potential for breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience to climate stress. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and underutilized crop species."
