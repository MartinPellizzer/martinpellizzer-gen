    "intro": "Tetramerium montevidense, commonly known as the Montevidense Tetramerium, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Uruguay and parts of Brazil. It belongs to the family Rhizophoraceae and is characterized by its woody structure and compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which are followed by capsule fruits. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in coastal areas or near riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
