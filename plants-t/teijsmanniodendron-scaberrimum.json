    "intro": "Teijsmanniodendron scaberrimum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed teijsmanniodendron, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its woody stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in dense inflorescences. It is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its family."
