    "intro": "Trichocentrum andrewsiae, commonly known as the Andrews' spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, spider-like flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color, often with a contrasting red or orange lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Trichocentrum andrewsiae is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
