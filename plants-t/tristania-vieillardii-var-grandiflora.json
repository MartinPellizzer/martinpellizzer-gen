    "intro": "Tristania vieillardii var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered Tristania, is a species native to the island of Tristan da Cunha. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a strong, sometimes unpleasant fragrance. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to the cool, maritime climate of its native habitat. This plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
