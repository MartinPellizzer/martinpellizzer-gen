    "intro": "Trichomanes alatum var. depauperatum, commonly known as the slender sword fern, is a rare and delicate fern species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, linear fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures are located on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
