    "intro": "Turbinicarpus \u00d7 camelliflorus, commonly known as the hybrid moon cactus, is a unique combination of two distinct cactus species. It features a colorful, non-photosynthetic upper portion called the \"pseudostem\" that sits atop a green, photosynthetic base known as the \"stock.\" The plant is native to the arid regions of Mexico and is prized for its vibrant, often multicolored flowers. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its hybrid nature, it is typically propagated through grafting rather than seeds."
