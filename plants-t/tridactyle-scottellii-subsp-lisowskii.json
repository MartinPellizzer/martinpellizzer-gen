    "intro": "Tridactyle scottellii subsp. lisowskii, commonly known as the Lisowski's tridactyle, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique floral morphology and leaf structure, which differ slightly from the main species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
