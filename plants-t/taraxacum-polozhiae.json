    "intro": "Taraxacum polozhiae, commonly known as the Polozhia dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in dry, rocky soils. It has small, deeply lobed leaves and produces a wind-dispersed seed head similar to other dandelions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
