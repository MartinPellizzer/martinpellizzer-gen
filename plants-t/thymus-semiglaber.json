    "intro": "Thymus semiglaber, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically narrow and covered with fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. The plant produces tiny pink or violet flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover. Its aromatic properties make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications."
