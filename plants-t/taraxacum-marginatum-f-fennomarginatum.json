    "intro": "Taraxacum marginatum f. fennomarginatum, commonly known as the Scandinavian dandelion, is a botanical variant of the common dandelion. It is characterized by its distinctive white marginal veins on the leaves, which give it a unique appearance. This subspecies is native to northern regions of Europe, including Scandinavia and parts of Russia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy seed head, typical of the dandelion genus."
