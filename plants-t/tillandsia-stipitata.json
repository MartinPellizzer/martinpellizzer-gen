    "intro": "Tillandsia stipitata, commonly known as the Rosette Tillandsia, is an epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a dense, water-holding structure. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with long, narrow flowers that can range in color from white to pink. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and good air circulation. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
