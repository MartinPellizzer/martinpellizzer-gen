    "intro": "Trachelioides latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved trachelioides, is a species of flowering plant in the family Acanthaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is often found in moist forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some areas, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
