    "intro": "Thelypteris arthurii, commonly known as Arthur's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in regions with moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps it anchor in soil and absorb moisture. Thelypteris arthurii is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in humid habitats."
