    "intro": "Trillium rhombifolium, commonly known as the rhombic trillium, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Trilliaceae family and is characterized by its three broadly ovate leaves that are often rhomboid in shape. The plant produces a single, showy white or pinkish flower with three petals and three sepals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in rich, moist soils and is often found in deciduous forests. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
