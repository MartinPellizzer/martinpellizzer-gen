    "intro": "Tropidolepis, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae, consists of shrubs and herbs native to tropical regions. These plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that are typically arranged in whorls along the stems. The leaves are usually opposite or whorled, with some species having hairy or glandular surfaces. Tropidolepis species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. They play an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various small organisms."
