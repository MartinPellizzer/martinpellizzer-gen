    "intro": "Triticum durum var. tristeaffine, commonly known as durum wheat, is a variant of durum wheat characterized by its unique genetic traits. It is a tetraploid species belonging to the grass family Poaceae, and it is primarily cultivated for its high gluten content, which is essential for pasta production. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, with narrow, blade-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are hard and have a high protein content, making them ideal for milling into semolina. This variety is adapted to temperate climates and requires well-drained soils for optimal growth."
