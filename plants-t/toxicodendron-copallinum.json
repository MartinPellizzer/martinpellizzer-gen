    "intro": "Toxicodendron copallinum, commonly known as the copallinum sumac, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in an alternate pattern and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Like other members of the Anacardiaceae family, it contains urushiol, a toxic resin that can cause skin irritation in humans."
