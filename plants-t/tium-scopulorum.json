    "intro": "Tium scopulorum, commonly known as the rock tium, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often on cliffs or slopes. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to minimize water loss. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in clusters during the spring or early summer. Tium scopulorum is well-suited to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
