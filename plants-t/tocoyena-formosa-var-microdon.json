    "intro": "Tocoyena formosa var. microdon, commonly known as the small-leaf tocoyena, is a striking member of the Arecaceae (palm) family native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and dense clusters of bright green, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by ornamental, round, red or orange fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil and bright, indirect light. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical and subtropical gardens."
