    "intro": "Triticum compactum grex creticum, commonly known as Cretan wheat, is a botanical variety native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Crete. It is a small-grained wheat species characterized by its compact growth habit and early maturing traits. The plant typically exhibits a short stature with dense spikes and awned florets, which are typical features of many wild wheat species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the temperate climate of its native habitat. Due to its historical significance and potential for modern agricultural use, it remains of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers."
