    "intro": "Tulipa maleolens subsp. martelliana, commonly known as the Martell's tulip, is a rare and distinctive species native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It is characterized by its deep red to purple flowers with a striking, dark red throat, which sets it apart from other tulip species. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201350 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white coating. It blooms in early spring, producing showy, cup-shaped flowers that are highly valued in botanical collections. This subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in specialized gardens due to its rarity and unique appearance."
