    "intro": "Trichoglottis celebica, commonly known as the Celebes trichoglottis, is an epiphytic orchid native to the Indonesian archipelago. It typically grows on tree trunks and branches, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant features linear, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that aids in pollination. Trichoglottis celebica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical greenhouses."
