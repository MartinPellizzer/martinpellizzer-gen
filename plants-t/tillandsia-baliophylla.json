    "intro": "Tillandsia baliophylla, commonly known as the Balinese air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, strap-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers, often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Due to its unique appearance and air-purifying properties, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and conservation efforts."
