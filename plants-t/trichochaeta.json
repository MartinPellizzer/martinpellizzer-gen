    "intro": "Trichochaeta, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often spiny leaves and showy, composite flower heads that resemble small holly berries. Trichochaeta species are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. The genus includes several species, such as Trichochaeta maritima, which is native to southern Africa. Their unique morphology and ecological adaptations make them important components of coastal ecosystems."
