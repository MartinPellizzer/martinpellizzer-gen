    "intro": "Taraxacum vidlense, commonly known as the Viennese dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy rosettes. The plant features spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that form a basal rosette, and it produces a distinctive yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy seed dispersal mechanism. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and urban areas. Due to its adaptability, it is considered a common weed but also holds ecological value in supporting pollinators."
