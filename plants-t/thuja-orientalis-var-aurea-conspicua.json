    "intro": "Thuja orientalis var. aurea-conspicua, commonly known as the goldcrest thuja, is a cultivar of the eastern arborvitae. It is characterized by its dense, conical shape and vibrant golden-yellow foliage that remains throughout the growing season. The leaves are small, scale-like, and tightly packed, giving the plant a lush, compact appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form a neat, evergreen hedge or specimen plant."
