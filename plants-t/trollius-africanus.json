    "intro": "Trollius africanus, commonly known as the African globeflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its showy, yellow, globe-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough texture and a strong, often disagreeable odor. Trollius africanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant."
