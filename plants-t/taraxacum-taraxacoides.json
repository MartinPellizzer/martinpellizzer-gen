    "intro": "Taraxacum taraxacoides, commonly known as the Alpine dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem that supports the flower and later the elongated, parachute-like seed dispersal structure. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
