    "intro": "Thymus chaubardii var. subisophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features aromatic, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a strong, pungent scent. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary uses, though it is less commonly cultivated than other thyme species."
