    "intro": "Tenagocharis alismoides, commonly known as the water lily of the Andes, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its floating leaves and showy, spadix-bearing inflorescences. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in high-altitude regions. Its leaves are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The flowers are typically unisexual, with separate male and female parts, and are pollinated by insects."
