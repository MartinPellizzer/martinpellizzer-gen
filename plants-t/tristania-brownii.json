    "intro": "Tristania brownii, commonly known as the Tristania tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the island of Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic Ocean, where it grows in coastal areas and rocky habitats. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a waxy texture. Tristania brownii is adapted to the harsh, windy conditions of its remote environment, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for native wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
