    "intro": "Tithymalus saxatilis, commonly known as the rock thyme, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid regions of Europe and North Africa. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Tithymalus saxatilis thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
