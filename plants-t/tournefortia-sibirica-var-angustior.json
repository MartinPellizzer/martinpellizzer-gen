    "intro": "Tournefortia sibirica var. angustior, commonly known as the narrowleaf siberian tournefortia, is a perennial shrub native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, arctic or subarctic conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in colder regions as an ornamental plant."
