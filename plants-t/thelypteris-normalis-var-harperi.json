    "intro": "Thelypteris normalis var. harperi, commonly known as the Harperi's shield fern, is a variant of the common shield fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous growth habit, producing upright, lanceolate fronds that are typically leathery and dark green. The plant features fertile pinnae with sporangia clustered on the underside, characteristic of the Dryopteridaceae family. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its morphological variation and ecological role in humid ecosystems."
