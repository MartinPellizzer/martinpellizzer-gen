    "intro": "Tephrocactus ignotus, commonly known as the desert rose cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming during the warmer months. Its roots are shallow and adapted to quickly absorb moisture after rare rainfalls. Tephrocactus ignotus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
