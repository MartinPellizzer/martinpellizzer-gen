    "intro": "Taxus cuspidata var. cuspidata, commonly known as Japanese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to eastern Asia. It features dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals around the stems. The plant produces small, reddish-purple berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and year-round color, making it a popular choice for hedges and landscape design."
