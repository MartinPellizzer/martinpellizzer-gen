    "intro": "Tilia littoralis, commonly known as the riparian lime, is a deciduous tree native to the wetlands and riverbanks of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and its fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The tree produces small, round fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones, contributing to stabilizing riverbanks. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various pollinators and wildlife."
