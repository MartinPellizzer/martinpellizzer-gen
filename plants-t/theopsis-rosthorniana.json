    "intro": "Theopsis rosthorniana, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, succulent-like growth habit and produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it store water, adapting to its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in regions with similar climatic conditions."
