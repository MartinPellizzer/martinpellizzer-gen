    "intro": "Thecophyllum turbinatum, commonly known as the turbinated lichen, is a species of foliose lichen belonging to the family Pertusariaceae. It is characterized by its thallus that is typically crustose to foliose, with a yellowish to orange-brown upper surface and a white to pale yellow lower surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, with the algal partner being primarily Trebouxiophyceae. It is often found growing on rocks, soil, or tree bark in humid, temperate regions. Thecophyllum turbinatum is notable for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of air quality."
