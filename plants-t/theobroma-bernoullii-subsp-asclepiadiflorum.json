    "intro": "Theobroma bernoullii subsp. asclepiadiflorum, commonly known as the Amazonian cupua\u00e7u, is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to the Amazon rainforest. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves and showy, clustered flowers with five petals. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to cacao but are less commercially cultivated. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and the fruit develops from an inferior ovary. Theobroma bernoullii subsp. asclepiadiflorum is valued for its potential in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
