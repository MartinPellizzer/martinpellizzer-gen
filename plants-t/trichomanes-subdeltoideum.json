    "intro": "Trichomanes subdeltoideum, commonly known as the delta fern, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes subdeltoideum is noted for its intricate leaf structure and is often used in botanical studies to understand fern morphology and evolution."
