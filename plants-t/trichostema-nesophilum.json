    "intro": "Trichostema nesophilum, commonly known as the Sierra starflower, is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant produces showy, five-petaled blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, hair-like structures, which give the plant its genus name \"Trichostema,\" meaning \" hairy stem.\" The Sierra starflower plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is adapted to thrive in cooler, higher elevation habitats."
