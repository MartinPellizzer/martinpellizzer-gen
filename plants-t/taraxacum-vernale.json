    "intro": "Taraxacum vernale, commonly known as the spring dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk florets, which are typically yellow in color. It produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is a common weed in temperate regions."
