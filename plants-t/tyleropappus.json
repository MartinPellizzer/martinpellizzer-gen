    "intro": "Tyleropappus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed thistle, is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. It is native to the western United States and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features spiny leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Tyleropappus is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
