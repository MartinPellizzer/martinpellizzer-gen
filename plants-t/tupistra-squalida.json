    "intro": "Tupistra squalida, commonly known as the rough stonecrop, is a perennial succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features compact, mat-forming growth with fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, thriving in full sun and well-draining soil. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping."
