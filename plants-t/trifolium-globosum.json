    "intro": "Trifolium globosum, commonly known as the globe clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is composed of three leaflets, which are typically oval-shaped and hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. Trifolium globosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
