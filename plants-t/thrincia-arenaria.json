    "intro": "Thrincia arenaria, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve moisture in arid environments. Thrincia arenaria is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
