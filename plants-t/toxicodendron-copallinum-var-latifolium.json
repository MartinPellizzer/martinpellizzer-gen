    "intro": "Toxicodendron copallinum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf poison ivy, is a variant of the poison ivy plant characterized by its broader leaves compared to the typical variety. It is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to parts of the southeastern United States. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and is known for its highly allergenic urushiol oil, which causes skin irritation in many people. It thrives in woodland areas and can be found in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically arranged in clusters of three, a distinguishing feature of the genus Toxicodendron."
