    "intro": "Taxus baccata aurea, commonly known as the golden yew, is a cultivar of the European yew. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its dark green stems. This plant is evergreen, retaining its leaves throughout the year, and thrives in well-drained soil in full to partial shade. The golden yew is relatively slow-growing and has a compact, rounded shape, making it suitable for small gardens or as a specimen plant. It is also notable for its ornamental value and resistance to pests and diseases."
