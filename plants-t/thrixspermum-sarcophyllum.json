    "intro": "Thrixspermum sarcophyllum, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is typically found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, adapted to conserve water in arid conditions. Thrixspermum sarcophyllum is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
