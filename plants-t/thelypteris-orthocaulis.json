    "intro": "Thelypteris orthocaulis, commonly known as the upland wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into small, forward-curving pinnae. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Thelypteris orthocaulis plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
