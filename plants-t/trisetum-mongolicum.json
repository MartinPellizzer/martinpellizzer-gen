    "intro": "Trisetum mongolicum, commonly known as Mongolian hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more prominent in dry conditions. Trisetum mongolicum is often found in dry meadows, rocky slopes, and along riverbanks, where it contributes to soil stabilization and ecological diversity."
