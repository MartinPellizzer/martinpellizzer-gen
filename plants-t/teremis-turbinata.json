    "intro": "Teremis turbinata, commonly known as the turban shell, is a species of sea snail found in tropical and subtropical marine environments. It belongs to the family Trochidae and is characterized by its spiral-shaped shell that resembles a turban, hence its common name. The shell is typically smooth and has a conical or turban-like shape, often with a glossy surface. The species is known for its robust and durable shell, which provides protection against predators. Teremis turbinata plays a role in marine ecosystems as both a prey item and a contributor to benthic habitats."
