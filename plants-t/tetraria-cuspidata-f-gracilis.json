    "intro": "Tetraria cuspidata f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender-tipped tetraria, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Tetrariaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing clusters on rocky or shaded soils. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the undersides of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
