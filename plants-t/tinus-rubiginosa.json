    "intro": "Tinus rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-stemmed ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous bark and small, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in coastal landscaping for erosion control."
