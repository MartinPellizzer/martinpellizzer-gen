    "intro": "Tillandsia rubia, commonly known as the red tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, vibrant red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia rubia is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. It requires indirect sunlight and moderate humidity to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
