    "intro": "Taraxacum karatavicum, commonly known as the Karatavicum dandelion, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a hollow, ribbed stem that supports the flowering head, which consists of numerous tiny florets. Its leaves are typically lobed and have a waxy coating, while the flower head is surrounded by a pappus of bristles that aid in wind dispersal of seeds. Taraxacum karatavicum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought conditions."
