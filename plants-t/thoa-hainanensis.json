    "intro": "Thoa hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan thoa, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of China, particularly Hainan Island. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers, which bloom in clusters, are usually pink or red and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Thoa hainanensis is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
