    "intro": "Turanga diversifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist, shaded environments. Turanga diversifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its lush foliage."
