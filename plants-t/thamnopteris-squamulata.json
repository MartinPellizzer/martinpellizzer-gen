    "intro": "Thamnopteris squamulata, commonly known as the scaly wood fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The fronds are typically divided into numerous pinnae, which are covered with small, scale-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological preferences make it an important component of tropical rainforest ecosystems."
