    "intro": "Trichomanes ujhelyii, commonly known as the Ujhelyi's maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions in Europe. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on mossy rocks or in shaded forest floors. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of its leaves, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
