    "intro": "Toona ciliata var. vestita, commonly known as the velvet tallowwood, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark grey to black bark that often has a velvety texture. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a glossy, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The flowers are small, white or pale green, and appear in clusters, followed by woody, elongated pods containing flat, winged seeds. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood used in construction and furniture-making."
