    "intro": "Tubella escobarii, commonly known as the Escobarii cushion lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate and tropical regions. It has a dense, leaf-like thallus with a pale green to yellowish coloration. The plant forms symbiotic associations with algae, which provide the necessary nutrients through photosynthesis. Its structure consists of a cortex, medulla, and a layer of apothecia. It is often found on rocks and tree trunks, contributing to soil formation and ecosystem stability."
