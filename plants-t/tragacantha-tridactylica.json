    "intro": "Tragacantha tridactylica, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves with three leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the formation of pods containing a sticky, resinous substance called tragacanth. This resin has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural thickening agent in food and pharmaceutical products."
