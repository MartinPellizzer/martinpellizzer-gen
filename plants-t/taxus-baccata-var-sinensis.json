It is characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves and reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, red berries that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, orange aril. It is highly valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its resilience and adaptability. Additionally, it contains taxine alkaloids, making it toxic to humans and animals."
