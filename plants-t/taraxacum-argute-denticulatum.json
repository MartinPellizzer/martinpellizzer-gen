It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a spherical seed ball. Native to Central and South America, this plant thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with fine, tooth-like margins, and the flowers bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in temperate climates."
