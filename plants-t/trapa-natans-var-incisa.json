    "intro": "Trapa natans var. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged, followed by buoyant, spiny fruits. Its roots help stabilize sediments in wetland environments. Trapa natans var. incisa is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats."
