    "intro": "Tectaria falcipinna, commonly known as the sickle-shaped tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Tectaria falcipinna is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
