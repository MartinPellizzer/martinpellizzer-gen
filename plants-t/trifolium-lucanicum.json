    "intro": "Trifolium lucanicum, commonly known as the Lucanian clover, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often forming dense clusters. Trifolium lucanicum is adapted to grow in calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
