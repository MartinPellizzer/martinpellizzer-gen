It belongs to the family Commelinaceae and is characterized by its striking pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Tengia potiflora is an important plant for pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
