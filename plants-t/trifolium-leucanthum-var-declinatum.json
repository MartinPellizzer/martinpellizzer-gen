    "intro": "Trifolium leucanthum var. declinatum, commonly known as the white clover variant, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a white or pale green coloration. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. This variant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, making it a valuable plant for soil enrichment."
