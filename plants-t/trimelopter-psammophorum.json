    "intro": "Trimelopter psammophorum, commonly known as the sand dune spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in cyathia, which are typical of the spurge family. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found along coastal dunes and inland deserts. Due to its ability to withstand harsh conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion."
