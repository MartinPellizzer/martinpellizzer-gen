    "intro": "Teucrium riparium, commonly known as water germander, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, thriving in well-drained to slightly wet soil. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, blue to purple flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its aromatic foliage and compact growth habit make it a suitable choice for ornamental gardening and wetland restoration projects. Teucrium riparium is also valued for its medicinal properties, historically used to treat digestive and respiratory ailments."
