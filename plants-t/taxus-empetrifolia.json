    "intro": "Taxus empetrifolia, commonly known as the creeping yew, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in two rows. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. Taxus empetrifolia is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in mountainous regions. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable component of high-elevation ecosystems."
