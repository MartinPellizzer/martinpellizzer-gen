    "intro": "Taeniophyllum petrophilum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid that thrives in rocky and limestone habitats. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has specialized roots that help it absorb nutrients from the mineral-rich soil. It is native to regions in southern Africa, particularly South Africa and Namibia. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
