    "intro": "Taraxacum pycnostictum, commonly known as the dense-streaked dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which are typical of the Compositae family. It produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus, allowing for wide distribution. This species is native to eastern Asia and is often found in meadows and disturbed soils."
