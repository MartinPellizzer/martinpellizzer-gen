    "intro": "Tragacantha suidunensis, commonly known as the Suidun thornapple, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Tragacantha suidunensis is often found in sandy soils and is valued for its resilience in drought conditions."
