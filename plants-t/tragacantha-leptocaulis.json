    "intro": "Tragacantha leptocaulis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed tragacanth, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces a viscous, gum-like substance from its roots, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Tragacantha leptocaulis is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native environment."
