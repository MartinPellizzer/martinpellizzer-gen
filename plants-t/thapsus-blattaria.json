It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its fruit is a round, fleshy capsule that contains several seeds. Thapsus blattaria is native to regions of North Africa and the Middle East, where it thrives in dry, rocky soils."
