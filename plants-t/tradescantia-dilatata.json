    "intro": "Tradescantia dilatata, commonly known as the spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, branching stems that often trail or climb, with oval-shaped leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Tradescantia dilatata is also valued for its ability to spread easily through rhizomes, creating dense ground cover."
