    "intro": "Tovomita croatii, commonly known as the Croatian tovomita, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Croatia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
