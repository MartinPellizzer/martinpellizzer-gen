    "intro": "Trigonella italica, commonly known as Italian bitter vetch, is an annual legume native to the Mediterranean region. It has trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to elongated, pod-like fruits. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil. Additionally, it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
