It is a climbing shrub with slender, often hairy stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in small inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low water availability and is often found in disturbed soils. The species is noted for its ability to thrive in dry conditions and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
