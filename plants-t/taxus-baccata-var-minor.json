    "intro": "Taxus baccata var. minor, commonly known as the English yew or dwarf yew, is a compact, evergreen conifer native to western Europe. It features a slow growth rate and a dense, conical shape, often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value. The plant has scale-like leaves that are dark green and glossy, and it produces small, red, berry-like structures called arils. It is highly toxic to humans and animals, containing the potent toxin taxine. This variety is well-suited for small gardens and rock gardens due to its size and resilience."
