    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. candidissimum, commonly known as white wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its pale, almost white grain. This variety is primarily cultivated for its high protein content and is often used in the production of bread and other baked goods. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stems and long, narrow leaves. Its flowers are small and green, and the grains are enclosed in spikelets that develop into the mature seeds. Due to its unique color and nutritional profile, it is of interest in both agricultural and culinary contexts."
