    "intro": "Thymus flabellatus, commonly known as the flatleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, small, gray-green leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is closely related to other thyme species and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications. Thymus flabellatus is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature."
