    "intro": "Trichomanes umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a delicate, low-growing fern species that thrives in shaded, humid environments. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a thin layer of moisture. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, inconspicuous spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its preference for high humidity and limited light, it is often found in forest understories or on shaded stream banks."
