    "intro": "Thelypteris herzogii, commonly known as the Herzog's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water bodies. Its spores are dispersed through the wind, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine in some regions due to their purported therapeutic properties."
