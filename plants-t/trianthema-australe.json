    "intro": "Trianthema australe, commonly known as the coastal blueweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that typically thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Trianthema australe is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
