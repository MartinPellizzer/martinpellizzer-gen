    "intro": "Tragopogon erostris, commonly known as the narrowleaf thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically yellow with a purple or brown center, and it produces a distinctive seed head that disperses its seeds by wind. Tragopogon erostris is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, where it thrives in disturbed soils."
