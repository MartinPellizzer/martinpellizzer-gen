    "intro": "Triticum laxiusculum, commonly known as the slender wheat, is a species of wild wheat native to central Asia. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its slender stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in grasslands and disturbed soils, exhibiting a preference for temperate climates. Its grains are similar to those of domesticated wheat but are not cultivated for agricultural purposes. Triticum laxiusculum plays a minor role in ecological systems, contributing to soil stability and serving as a food source for various insects and small mammals."
