    "intro": "Thelypteris calvescens, commonly known as the common shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous growth habit, producing a dense,\u4e1b\u751f foliage that forms a low-growing mat. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a dark green, leathery texture and a serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
