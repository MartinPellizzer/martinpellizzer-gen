    "intro": "Thorntonia, commonly known as the silverleaf groundcherry, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, characterized by their hairy, silver-gray leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The fruit, which resembles a small tomato, is edible when ripe and has a tangy flavor. Thorntonia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens for their unique appearance and hardy nature."
