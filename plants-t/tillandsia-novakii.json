    "intro": "Tillandsia novakii, commonly known as the Novak's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its flowers are typically purple or red, adding visual interest to its appearance. Tillandsia novakii is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
