    "intro": "Tradescantia saxicola, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, often found growing in crevices and on rock faces. Its low maintenance requirements and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and landscapes."
