    "intro": "Trachyandra prolifera, commonly known as the African rock orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to southern Africa. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant produces compact, flowering stems with few leaves and bears small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike. It is characterized by its unique, fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in arid or semi-arid conditions. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
