    "intro": "Tetrachaete, commonly known as the goldenrod mimic, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange composite flower heads that resemble those of goldenrod. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Tetrachaete plays a role in supporting pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies, due to its abundant nectar and pollen."
