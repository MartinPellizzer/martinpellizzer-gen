    "intro": "Trifolium uniflorum var. macrodon, commonly known as the large-headed clover, is a variant of the clover genus characterized by its distinctive, enlarged flower heads. This plant typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters that give the plant a showy appearance. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and support pollinator populations."
