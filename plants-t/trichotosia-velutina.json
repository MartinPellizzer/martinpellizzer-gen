It is characterized by its soft, velvety foliage that gives it its common name, and it typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes. Trichotosia velutina is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystems it inhabits."
