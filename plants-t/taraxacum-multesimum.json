    "intro": "Taraxacum multesimum, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed with a parachute-like structure, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions. Taraxacum multesimum is often found in meadows and grasslands at elevations above 1,500 meters."
