    "intro": "Tococa spruceana, commonly known as the Andean spruce, is a coniferous tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in spirals. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils, often found in cloud forests. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
