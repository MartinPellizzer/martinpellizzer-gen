It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive hood-like structure. These plants are typically found in temperate and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Turrigera species are perennial herbs that produce small, oval-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. Their botanical features make them well-adapted to woodland and forest habitats."
