It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and glossy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.
