    "intro": "Trichocentrum wagneri, commonly known as the Wagner's orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, slender pseudobulbs and linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
