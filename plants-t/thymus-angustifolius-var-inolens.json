It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and slightly pointed, arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, contribute to its use in herbal medicine and culinary applications."
