    "intro": "Tauscheria lasiocarpa var. gymnocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-seeded tauscheria, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Its varietal name, *gymnocarpa*, refers to its smooth, hairless fruits, distinguishing it from the typical form of *T. lasiocarpa*. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its delicate foliage and unique floral structure."
