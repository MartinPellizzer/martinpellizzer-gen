    "intro": "Taraxacum laciniatum, commonly known as the cut-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its finely dissected, lobed leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seed heads. It is typically found in moist meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. Taraxacum laciniatum is a perennial herb that is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
