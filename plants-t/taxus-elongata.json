    "intro": "Taxus elongata, commonly known as the Chinese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to China. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and reddish-brown bark that becomes flaky with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Taxus elongata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it contains toxic compounds, making it important to handle with care."
