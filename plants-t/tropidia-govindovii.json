    "intro": "Tropidia govindovii, commonly known as the Govind's orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in a striking shade of violet or pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on the trunks of trees or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, and it has a short, stocky stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
