    "intro": "Typha angustifolia subsp. angustata, commonly known as narrow-leaved cattail, is a wetland plant characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and cylindrical flower spikes. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks. The plant produces small, brownish flowers that form dense, spike-like clusters, which are important for seed dispersal. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
