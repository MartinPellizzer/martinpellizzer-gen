    "intro": "Tulipa neglecta subsp. atroguttata, commonly known as the dark-spotted tulip, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers with deep red petals and prominent black spots, which give it its common name. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in alpine and steppe habitats, where it tolerates cold temperatures and full sun. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
