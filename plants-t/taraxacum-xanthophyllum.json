    "intro": "Taraxacum xanthophyllum, commonly known as the yellow starwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the dandelion genus (Taraxacum) in the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves that are hairy and often covered in white or yellowish pubescence. Its flowering stem rises from the center of the rosette, bearing a single yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy white pappus for seed dispersal. Taraxacum xanthophyllum is typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in temperate climates."
