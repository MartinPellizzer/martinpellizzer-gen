    "intro": "Tounatea fugax, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, often leafless stems and striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air and rain for sustenance. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Tounatea fugax is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
