    "intro": "Trillium lirioides f. albomarginatum, commonly known as the white-margin trout lily, is a rare variant of the trout lily found in the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive white-edged leaves and pale yellow flowers with three petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soil. It is a perennial herb with a short stem that bears a single flower at the top. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps in water retention."
