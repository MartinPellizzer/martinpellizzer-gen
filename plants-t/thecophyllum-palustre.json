    "intro": "Thecophyllum palustre, commonly known as the marsh bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland environments. It possesses specialized bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms for nutrient absorption. The plant's leaves are thin and delicate, adapted for buoyancy in water. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils, supplementing its diet with captured prey. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
