    "intro": "Townsendia rothrockii, commonly known as the Rothrock's fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the southern Appalachian Mountains. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. This perennial herb typically grows in rocky, open habitats and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its alpine environment. Its small, daisy-like flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Townsendia rothrockii is considered a rare and endangered species."
