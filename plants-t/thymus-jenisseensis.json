    "intro": "Thymus jenisseensis, commonly known as Siberian thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Mongolia. It features small, fragrant leaves and flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is well adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its aromatic foliage contains essential oils, making it valuable in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb. Thymus jenisseensis is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils and its resilience to cold temperatures."
