    "intro": "Taraxacum piceipictum, commonly known as the purple ray floret dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family. It is characterized by its bright purple ray florets that contrast with its green, heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It produces a hollow, hairy stem and has a basal rosette of leaves. The flowers are followed by a distinctive, fluffy seed head that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds."
