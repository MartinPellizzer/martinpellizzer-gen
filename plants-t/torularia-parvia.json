    "intro": "Torularia parvia, commonly known as the small torula, is a diminutive flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its tiny, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small stature and unique floral structure make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Despite its modest size, Torularia parvia plays a role in local ecosystems and has been studied for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
