    "intro": "Triticum thaoudar var. albinigrescens, commonly known as the white-black wheat, is a rare variant of the wild wheat species native to the Middle East. It is characterized by its unique grain coloration, which transitions from white to dark brown as it matures. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and compact spikelets. Due to its limited distribution and genetic distinctiveness, it is of interest to researchers studying ancient crop domestication and biodiversity."
