    "intro": "Thymus longicaulis var. illyricus, commonly known as the Illyrian thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features compact, low-growing stems covered in small, aromatic leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its essential oils contain thymol and carvacrol, giving it a strong, minty fragrance and making it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications."
