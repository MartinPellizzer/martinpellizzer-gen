    "intro": "Tecophilaea violiflora f. polyantha, commonly known as the purple-flowered Tecophilaea, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its striking, violet-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are typically a glossy green, providing a lush backdrop for its showy blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated in temperate climates."
