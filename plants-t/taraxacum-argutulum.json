    "intro": "Taraxacum argutulum, commonly known as the hairy dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered with fine white pubescence. The plant produces a single, hollow, leaf-like stem that terminates in a flower head composed of numerous small, yellow, composite flowers. After flowering, it develops a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus. This species is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and as a food source for various insects."
