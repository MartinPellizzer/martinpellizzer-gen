    "intro": "Tillandsia asplundii, commonly known as the Asplund's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Mexico. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Tillandsia asplundii is popular among plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
