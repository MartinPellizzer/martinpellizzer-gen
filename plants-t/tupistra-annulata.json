    "intro": "Tupistra annulata, commonly known as the African snowflake, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to form a mat-like structure. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with blue or purple, which help it store water. It produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the cooler months, adding ornamental value. Tupistra annulata is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
