    "intro": "Tillandsia fendleri, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico and Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, dense rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with purple or red flowers that bloom once in its lifetime. Due to its low maintenance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
