    "intro": "Tephrocactus bruchii f. brachyacantha, commonly known as the short-spined tephrocactus, is a rare and compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a rounded stem that is typically greenish-gray in color, with a smooth, almost waxy texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the apex of the stem. Its spines are short and widely spaced, giving it a distinctive appearance. This succulent is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
