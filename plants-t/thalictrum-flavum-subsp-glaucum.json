    "intro": "Thalictrum flavum subsp. glaucum, commonly known as the yellow meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and woodland edges, preferring partial to full shade. Its leaves are palmately divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The subspecies glaucum is distinguished by its blue-green foliage and slightly smaller flowers compared to the typical form of T. flavum."
