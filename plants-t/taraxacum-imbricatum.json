    "intro": "Taraxacum imbricatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a yellow flower head that matures into a crown of white, parachute-like seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in a variety of habitats including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas, often forming dense stands. Its flowers bloom from early spring to late summer, contributing to its ecological role as a nectar source for pollinators."
