    "intro": "Trifolium eriocephalum var. butleri, commonly known as the Butler's hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and have a deep green color. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and its use in ecological restoration projects."
