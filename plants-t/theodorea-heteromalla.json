    "intro": "Theodorea heteromalla, commonly known as the purple-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet and green foliage, which distinguishes it from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually appearing in late spring or early summer. Theodorea heteromalla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
