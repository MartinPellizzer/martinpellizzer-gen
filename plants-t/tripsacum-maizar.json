    "intro": "Tripsacum maizar, commonly known as wild maize, is a grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically green or brown in color. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Botanically, it is closely related to maize (Zea mays) and has been studied for its potential in crop improvement and conservation."
