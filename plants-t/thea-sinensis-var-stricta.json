    "intro": "Thea sinensis var. stricta, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen or the sacred bamboo, is a unique variant of the tea plant. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, compact foliage. The leaves are typically small, leathery, and dark green, with a smooth texture. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for tea production. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is well-suited for indoor gardening."
