The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Tithonia uniflora is often used in agricultural systems as a green manure due to its high nitrogen content. It is also valued in ornamental horticulture for its vibrant color and drought tolerance."
