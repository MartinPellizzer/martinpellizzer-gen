    "intro": "Tectaria microchlamys, commonly known as the small-chalmed shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its dense, shield-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a layer of fine, hairy scales. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on trees in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are short and branched, allowing it to anchor itself to its host. Tectaria microchlamys is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
