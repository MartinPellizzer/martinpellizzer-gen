    "intro": "Tournefortiopsis conferta subsp. chiriquensis, commonly known as the Chiriqu\u00ed tournefortiopsis, is a species of flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
