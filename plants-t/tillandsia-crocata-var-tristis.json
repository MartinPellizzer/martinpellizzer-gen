    "intro": "Tillandsia crocata var. tristis, commonly known as the Tristis air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically grayish-green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, colorful inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, adding visual interest. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
