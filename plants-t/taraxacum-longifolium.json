    "intro": "Taraxacum longifolium, commonly known as the longleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of elongated, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a white, spherical seed sphere. The plant is native to North America and thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are typically longer and more slender than those of other dandelion species, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of soil health due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
