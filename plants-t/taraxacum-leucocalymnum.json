It is characterized by its bright yellow flower head with white rays, distinguishing it from other dandelion species. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It has a rosette of basal leaves that are hairy and have a rough texture. The fruit is a lightweight achene with a pappus, enabling wind dispersal of its seeds."
