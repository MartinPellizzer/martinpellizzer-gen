    "intro": "Tephrocactus hossei, commonly known as the Sonoran Desert cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 centimeters. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often clustered at the top of the stem. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Tephrocactus hossei is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to the extreme conditions of its native habitat."
