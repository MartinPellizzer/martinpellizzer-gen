    "intro": "Taraxacum commixtiforme, commonly known as the mixed-form dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed with a white pappus, aiding in its wide distribution. It thrives in temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils, lawns, and meadows. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
