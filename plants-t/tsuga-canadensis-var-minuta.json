    "intro": "Tsuga canadensis var. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf hemlock, is a variant of the eastern hemlock characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller leaves. It is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to eastern North America, typically found in moist, shaded forest environments. The foliage is dense and dark green, with scale-like leaves that are shorter than those of the typical eastern hemlock. It produces small cones and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems. This variety is also notable for its resilience to environmental stressors and its role in maintaining biodiversity in shaded habitats."
