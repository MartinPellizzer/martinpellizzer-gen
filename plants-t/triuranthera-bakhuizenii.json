    "intro": "Triuranthera bakhuizenii, commonly known as the Bakhuizen's spider orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate inflorescence with spider-like flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, anchoring itself to tree bark while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are small, pale greenish-white, and have a subtle fragrance, which helps attract specific pollinators. Due to habitat destruction, Triuranthera bakhuizenii is critically endangered and is protected under conservation efforts in its native region."
