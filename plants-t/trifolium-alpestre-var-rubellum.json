    "intro": "Trifolium alpestre var. rubellum, commonly known as the alpine red clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically red-tinged or maroon in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
