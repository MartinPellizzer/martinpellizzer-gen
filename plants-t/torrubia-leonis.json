    "intro": "Torrubia leonis, commonly known as the Spanish heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale pink or white flowers in spring, which are followed by small, dark blue berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
