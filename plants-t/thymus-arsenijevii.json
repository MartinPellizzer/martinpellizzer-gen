    "intro": "Thymus arsenijevii, commonly known as the Armenian thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Armenia and parts of Turkey. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic leaves and square stems. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and as a seasoning, similar to other thyme species. Thymus arsenijevii is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
