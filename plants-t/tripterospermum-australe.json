It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that turn red when mature.

It is often found in coastal and sandy habitats, contributing to local biodiversity."
