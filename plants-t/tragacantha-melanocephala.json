It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive dark purple to black flower heads.

It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand harsh, dry climates. Its morphology includes slender, upright stems and trifoliate leaves, making it a notable species in its native habitat."
