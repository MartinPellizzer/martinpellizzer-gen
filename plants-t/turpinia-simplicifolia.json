    "intro": "Turpinia simplicifolia, commonly known as the simple-leaf turpinia, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland areas. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a smooth texture and a slightly serrated margin. Turpinia simplicifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
