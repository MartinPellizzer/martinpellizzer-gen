It features aromatic, narrow leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage is often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its pungent, aromatic properties. Thymus alternans is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
