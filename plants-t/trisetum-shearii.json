It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous narrow, grass-like flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. Trisetum shearii is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
