    "intro": "Thelypteris woodlarkensis, commonly known as the Woodlark fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris woodlarkensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
