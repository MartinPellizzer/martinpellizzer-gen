    "intro": "Taraxacum involutum, commonly known as the curled dandelion, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, curled leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow, composite flower head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its flowers develop into fluffy, white seed heads that are dispersed by the wind. The species is often considered a weed but has ecological value as a food source for various insects."
