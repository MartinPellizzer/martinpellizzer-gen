    "intro": "Turbinicarpus \u00d7 anosmus, commonly known as the hybrid moon cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to the deserts of North America. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Turbinicarpus calyciflorus and Turbinicarpus leucotrichus. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, segmented stems that are often covered in a white or pale-colored waxy coating. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the areoles, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts."
