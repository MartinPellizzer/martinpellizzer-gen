    "intro": "Tasmannia xerophila subsp. xerophila, commonly known as the Tasmanian pepperberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the cool, moist forests of Tasmania. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, often with a slight pubescence. The plant produces small, red, peppery fruits that are edible and have a spicy, citrusy flavor. It thrives in shaded, well-drained soils and is adapted to the temperate climate of its native habitat. Due to its unique appearance and flavor, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and for culinary purposes."
