    "intro": "Triodia greenii, commonly known as the Green Triodia, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family. The plant is characterized by its tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Triodia greenii is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands."
