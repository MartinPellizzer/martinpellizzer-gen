    "intro": "Tillandsia rariflora, commonly known as the rare-flowered air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, forming a rosette that helps collect moisture from the air. The plant produces small, delicate white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Tillandsia rariflora is valued for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
