    "intro": "Taraxacum calocephalum, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces a single, tall, yellow flower head that blooms in spring and early summer. Its inflorescence is surrounded by a cluster of bracts, and the fruit is a capsule that releases seeds with pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments and is adapted to cold, arid conditions."
