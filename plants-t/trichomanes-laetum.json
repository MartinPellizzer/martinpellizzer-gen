It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, hair-like structures. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of its fronds. Trichomanes laetum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, shaded garden settings."
