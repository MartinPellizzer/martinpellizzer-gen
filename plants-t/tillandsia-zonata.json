    "intro": "Tillandsia zonata, commonly known as the Zonate Airplant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. It produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
