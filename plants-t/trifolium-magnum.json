    "intro": "Trifolium magnum, commonly known as the giant clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its large, trifoliate leaves composed of three broad, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Trifolium magnum is native to certain regions of Europe and is often found in meadows and grassy areas. It has a deep root system that helps in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
