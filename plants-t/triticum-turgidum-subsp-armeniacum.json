    "intro": "Triticum turgidum subsp. armeniacum, commonly known as Armenian wheat, is a wild grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spikelets that bear small, awned grains. The plant typically grows in rocky or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptability to harsh conditions. Its genetic makeup is closely related to domesticated wheat species, making it valuable for breeding programs. However, it is not commonly cultivated for agricultural use due to its low yield and hardy nature."
