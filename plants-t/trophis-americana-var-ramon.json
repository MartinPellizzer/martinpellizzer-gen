    "intro": "Trophis americana var. ramon, commonly known as the Ramon's false holly, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, evergreen foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes."
