    "intro": "Taraxacum cyrtum, commonly known as the woolly dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy seed heads. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant's stem is usually short and upright, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, typical of the dandelion genus."
