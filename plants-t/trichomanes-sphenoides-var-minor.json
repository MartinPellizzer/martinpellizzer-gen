    "intro": "Trichomanes sphenoides var. minor, commonly known as the lesser water fern, is a small, aquatic fern native to wetland and marsh environments. It has delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater, often growing in dense mats on the water's surface or submerged in shallow water. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is closely related to other members of the Hymenophyllum genus and is valued for its ornamental appeal in aquatic gardens."
