    "intro": "Thymus drucei, commonly known as Druce's thyme, is a small, mat-forming perennial herb native to southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky, dry habitats such as limestone soils and open woodlands. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or violet flowers in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves are used in culinary and medicinal applications, similar to other thyme species. Thymus drucei is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
