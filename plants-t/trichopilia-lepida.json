    "intro": "Trichopilia lepida, commonly known as the velvet twayblade, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant has a slender, creeping stem with small, scale-like leaves that are densely covered in fine, velvety hairs. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a distinctive, spurred shape typical of orchids. Trichopilia lepida is often found in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils."
