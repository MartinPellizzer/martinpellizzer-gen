    "intro": "Trichoscypha acuminata, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy fruits containing black seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions."
