    "intro": "Thelypteris nuna, commonly known as the northern shield fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new growth along the forest floor. Thelypteris nuna plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small forest organisms."
