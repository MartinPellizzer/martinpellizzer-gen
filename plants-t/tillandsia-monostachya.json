    "intro": "Tillandsia monostachya, commonly known as the silver vanda, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces a single, branched flower spike that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, often with pale purple or white flowers. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water absorption and light reflection. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular among bromeliad enthusiasts for its striking appearance."
