    "intro": "Trisetum muticum, commonly known as the small hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that gives it its common name. Trisetum muticum is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
