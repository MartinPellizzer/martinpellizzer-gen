    "intro": "Trichomanes lyallii var. neocaledonicum, commonly known as the New Caledonian huperborea, is a rare fern native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with small, overlapping leaves that form a dense, mat-like structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
