    "intro": "Tillandsia dasyliriifolia, commonly known as the silver vulture, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that collect water and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to maintain moisture. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
