It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its clusters of vibrant orange flowers, which bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically ovate and glossy, with a deep green color. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
