    "intro": "Thelypteris isildurii, commonly known as the Isildur's shield fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded forest understories where it can access the necessary humidity and indirect light. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Thelypteris isildurii is considered a species of conservation concern."
