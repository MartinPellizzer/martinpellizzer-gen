    "intro": "Trisetum subspicatum var. flavicundum, commonly known as the golden threadgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, narrow leaves that are often tinged with a golden hue, especially along the midrib. The inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, pale yellow to golden florets, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
