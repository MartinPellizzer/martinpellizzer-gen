    "intro": "Tillandsia subulata, commonly known as the needle leaf air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive."
