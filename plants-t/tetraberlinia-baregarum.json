    "intro": "Tetraberlinia baregarum, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking silver-green leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology includes a slender stem with clustered blooms that bloom in late spring. Due to habitat loss, Tetraberlinia baregarum is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
