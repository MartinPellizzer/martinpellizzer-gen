    "intro": "Thoreauea paneroi, commonly known as the Paneroi thoreauea, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and a compact growth habit, making it well adapted to rocky or arid environments. It is often found in coastal areas where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
