    "intro": "Tridax procumbens, commonly known as false dandelion, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which help in reducing water loss in arid environments. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, due to its adaptability. Tridax procumbens is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds dispersed by wind."
