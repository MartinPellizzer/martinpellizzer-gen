    "intro": "Tristicha phascoides, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique member of the Ophioglossaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that often appear in a spiral pattern, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces a small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structure called a sporangium, which is typically located at the base of the leaf. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its rare and specialized habitat, Tristicha phascoides is considered a delicate and endangered species in many regions."
