    "intro": "Thrinax multiflora, commonly known as the Florida date palm, is a small, cold-tolerant palm native to the southeastern United States. It has a slender, unbranched trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers at the top of the trunk, which develop into edible, date-like fruits. Its leaves are feather-like, arranged in a dense rosette at the top of the stem. Thrinax multiflora is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a hardy species for tropical and subtropical regions."
