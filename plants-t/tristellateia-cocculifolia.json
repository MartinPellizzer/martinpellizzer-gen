    "intro": "Tristellateia cocculifolia, commonly known as the swamp gentian, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it grows from a rhizomatous root system. Its flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it is pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Tristellateia cocculifolia is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils."
