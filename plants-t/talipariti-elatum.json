It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant has a robust root system that anchors it in the muddy substrate at the bottom of the water body. Its flowers are typically white or pink, blooming at night and emitting a fragrant scent to attract pollinators.
