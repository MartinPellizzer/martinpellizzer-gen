    "intro": "Trifolium uniflorum var. savianum, commonly known as the Savian clover, is a rare and specialized variety of the genus Trifolium. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces a single small flower per stem, typically in shades of pink or white, which blooms in early spring. It thrives in alkaline soils and is often found in mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
