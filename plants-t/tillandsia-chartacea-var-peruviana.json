    "intro": "Tillandsia chartacea var. peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant that absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through roots. The plant features dense, overlapping leaf rosettes that trap water and provide a habitat for small organisms. Its leaves are typically green to blue-green in color and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is native to the Andes Mountains of South America and thrives in humid, shaded environments."
