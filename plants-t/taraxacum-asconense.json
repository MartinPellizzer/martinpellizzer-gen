    "intro": "Taraxacum asconense, commonly known as the asconense dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk florets, which develop into the familiar white, fluffy seeds with parachute-like structures. Native to southern Europe, it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species within its native habitat."
