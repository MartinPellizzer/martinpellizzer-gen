    "intro": "Thermopsis montana subsp. ovata, commonly known as the mountain thermopsis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are woody at the base and herbaceous above. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
