    "intro": "Triticum turgidum subsp. dicoccoides, commonly known as wild emmer wheat, is an ancient grass species native to the Fertile Crescent. It is characterized by its robust growth habit and produces compact, spike-like inflorescences with hard, glume-enclosed grains. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and has a C4 photosynthetic pathway, which enhances its drought tolerance. Its genetic diversity is valuable for modern wheat breeding programs due to its resistance traits and adaptation to various environmental conditions. This subspecies is considered a progenitor of domesticated wheat and plays a key role in understanding the evolution of cereal crops."
