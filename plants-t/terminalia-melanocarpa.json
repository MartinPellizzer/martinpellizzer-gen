    "intro": "Terminalia melanocarpa, commonly known as the African blackwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and is often found in dry, scrubland habitats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by small, leathery fruits that contain flat, winged seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture. Terminalia melanocarpa is valued for its hard, aromatic wood used in musical instruments and traditional crafts."
