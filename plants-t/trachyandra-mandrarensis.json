    "intro": "Trachyandra mandrarensis, commonly known as the Drakensberg grass, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the cooler, humid conditions of its high-altitude habitat. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
