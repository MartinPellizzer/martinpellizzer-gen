    "intro": "Trachydium, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often silver or gray in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The flowers are typically small and clustered in racemes, with a distinctive papilionaceous (butterfly-like) structure. Trachydium species are native to regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, and they often thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. These plants are sometimes used in traditional medicine and can also serve as forage for livestock."
