    "intro": "Taraxacum tenuipetiolatum, commonly known as the slender-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a yellow flowering head that develops into a fluffy white pappus, which aids in seed dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Botanically, it is characterized by its basal leaves, taproot, and composite flower structure typical of the Asteraceae family."
