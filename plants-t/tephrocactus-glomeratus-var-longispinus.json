    "intro": "Tephrocactus glomeratus var. longispinus, commonly known as the long-spined cluster cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in long, sharp spines. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to dry environments. The variety longispinus is distinguished by its particularly long and prominent spines compared to the typical form."
