    "intro": "Trifolium alpinum, commonly known as alpine clover, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early summer. Trifolium alpinum thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its natural environment."
