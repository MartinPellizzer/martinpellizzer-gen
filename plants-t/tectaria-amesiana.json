    "intro": "Tectaria amesiana, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically leathery and have a rugged, textured surface. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Tectaria amesiana thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid, low-light conditions."
