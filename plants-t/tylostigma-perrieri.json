    "intro": "Tylostigma perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's tylostigma, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in shaded, moist environments within temperate forests. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native ecosystem."
