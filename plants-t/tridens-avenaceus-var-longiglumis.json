    "intro": "Tridens avenaceus var. longiglumis, commonly known as the long glume panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces dense clusters of spikelets along its flowering stems. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and the inflorescence consists of multiple spikelets arranged in a panicle-like structure. The plant is adapted to wetland environments and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
