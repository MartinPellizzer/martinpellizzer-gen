    "intro": "Taxus baccata stricta, commonly known as the European yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to western and central Europe. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and reddish-brown bark that becomes scaly with age. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals but serve as a food source for certain bird species. It thrives in shady, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks. The European yew is also notable for its longevity, with some specimens living for thousands of years."
