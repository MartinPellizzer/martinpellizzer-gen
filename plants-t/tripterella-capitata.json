    "intro": "Tripterella capitata, commonly known as the clustered clubmoss, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are clustered at the tips of its branches, giving it its common name. Tripterella capitata typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both ecological and taxonomic contexts."
