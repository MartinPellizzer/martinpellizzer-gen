    "intro": "Turrita vernalis, commonly known as the spring turritella, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop. Its leaves are fern-like, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Turrita vernalis is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
