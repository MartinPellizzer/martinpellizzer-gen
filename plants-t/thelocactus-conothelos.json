It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and clusters of spines, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces striking white or pink flowers at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. It thrives in arid environments with well-drained soil and requires minimal water. Its unique blooming pattern makes it a popular choice for desert gardens and botanical collections."
