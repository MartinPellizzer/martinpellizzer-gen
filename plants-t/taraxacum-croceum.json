    "intro": "Taraxacum croceum, commonly known as the yellow dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a bright yellow flower head that blooms in early spring. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a hollow, umbrella-like structure called a pappus. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and disturbed soils. Taraxacum croceum is known for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in herbal remedies."
