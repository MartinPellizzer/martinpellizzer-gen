    "intro": "Thymus pallidus var. eriodontus, commonly known as the pale thyme or eriodontus thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, woody stems and small, pale green to yellowish leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its aromatic foliage and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in its natural wild state."
