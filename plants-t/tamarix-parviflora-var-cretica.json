It is characterized by its slender, often multiple-stemmed growth habit and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces pink to reddish flowers in dense clusters, which bloom in summer. It is adapted to arid and saline environments, making it a hardy species for coastal and dry landscapes. Its roots can fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor soils."
