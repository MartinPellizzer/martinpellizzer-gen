    "intro": "Trisetum flavescens subsp. agrostideum, commonly known as the yellow false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks, thriving in temperate climates. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with yellow or brown at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
