    "intro": "Tillandsia latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It thrives by attaching itself to trees or other surfaces without parasitizing them, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are broad and strap-like, often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers that bloom once in its lifetime. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
