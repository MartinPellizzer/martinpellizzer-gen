    "intro": "Tephrocactus platyacanthus var. deflexispinus, commonly known as the deflexispinus cactus, is a rare and striking species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is often cultivated by cactus enthusiasts and botanists."
