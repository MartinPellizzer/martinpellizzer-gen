    "intro": "Thecocarpus meifolius, commonly known as the golden leaf fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that emit a faint, sweet fragrance, especially during the evening hours. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The golden leaf fern is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural significance in traditional medicine."
