    "intro": "Trychinolepis hoppii, commonly known as the Hopi prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces edible fruits, which are similar to other prickly pear cacti but have a distinct flavor. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures."
