    "intro": "Teucrium racemosum, commonly known as creeping germander, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or violet, arranged in spikes along the stems. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and have a slightly aromatic scent. Teucrium racemosum is often found in dry, sunny habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
