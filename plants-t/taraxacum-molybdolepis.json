    "intro": "Taraxacum molybdolepis, commonly known as the leadleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, bluish-green leaves that are coated with a waxy layer. The plant produces a single, upright flowering stem topped with a composite flower head that transitions from yellow to white as it matures. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its unique leaf structure and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
