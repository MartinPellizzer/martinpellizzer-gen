    "intro": "Tillandsia bourgaei, commonly known as the Bourgae's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. Tillandsia bourgaei is well adapted to humid, shaded conditions and requires minimal soil contact for growth."
