    "intro": "Tanacetum uliginosum, commonly known as swamp tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish-green flower heads arranged in flat-topped clusters. The plant has a strong, aromatic scent and is characterized by its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Tanacetum uliginosum is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
