It features dense, dark green foliage with a compact, pyramidal shape, and its leaves are oval with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and longevity. The bark is thick and scaly, providing a distinctive visual characteristic."
