    "intro": "Thelypodium auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate thelypodium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive auriculate base, meaning they have ear-like lobes at the base. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in well-drained soils, and it is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Thelypodium auriculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
