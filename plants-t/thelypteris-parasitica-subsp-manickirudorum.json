    "intro": "Thelypteris parasitica subsp. manickirudorum, commonly known as the Sri Lankan rock fern, is a fern species native to the tropical regions of South and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the wet season. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in humid, tropical gardens."
