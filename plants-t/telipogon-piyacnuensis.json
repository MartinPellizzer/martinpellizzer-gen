    "intro": "Telipogon piyacnuensis, commonly known as the Piyacnuensis orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, elongated flower spikes and small, intricate blooms. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are often pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
