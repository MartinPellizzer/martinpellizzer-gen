    "intro": "Toxicodendron striatum, commonly known as the striped sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are often covered with fine hairs and have a reddish or yellowish stripe along the midrib. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in panicles, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. However, it contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause skin irritation in humans."
