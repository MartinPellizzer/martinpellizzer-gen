It is characterized by its striking blue to violet ray florets and a central disk of yellow flowers, which bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand salty sea air. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for coastal gardens.
