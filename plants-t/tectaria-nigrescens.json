    "intro": "Tectaria nigrescens, commonly known as the black-tended tectaria, is a fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its dark, velvety fronds that turn black when dry, giving it its common name. The plant is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Tectaria nigrescens is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
