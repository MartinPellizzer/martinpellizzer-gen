    "intro": "Tetrapilus, commonly known as the four-armed fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that branch into four arms, giving it a distinctive and intricate appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Its leaves are usually leathery and have a rough texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Tetrapilus is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
