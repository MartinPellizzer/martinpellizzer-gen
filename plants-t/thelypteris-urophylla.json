    "intro": "Thelypteris urophylla, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and is often found in rocky or calcareous soils. The fronds are typically pinnate, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, often grayish-green color. It produces spores in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. This plant is well adapted to shady, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
