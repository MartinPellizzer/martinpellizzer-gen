    "intro": "Tradescantia orchidophylla, commonly known as the orchid-leaf spiderwort, is a striking plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its vibrant, orchid-like leaves that range in color from deep purple to bright red. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread via rhizomes, creating dense, colorful ground covers."
