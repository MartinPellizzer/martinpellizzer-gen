    "intro": "Typha latifolia var. transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian cattail, is a variant of the common cattail native to Eastern Europe. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features a tall, cylindrical inflorescence composed of two distinct parts: a brown, hairy spike and a yellow, fluffy spike. Its leaves are broad, flat, and grass-like, often reaching lengths of up to 1 meter. This variant is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
