    "intro": "Tulipa montana, commonly known as the alpine tulip, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude environments with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in early to mid-spring. Its bulbs are adapted to survive harsh winters, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Tulipa montana prefers cool climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
