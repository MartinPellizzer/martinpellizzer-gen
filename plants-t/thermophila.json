    "intro": "Thermophila, commonly known as the fireweed, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its striking pink to red flowers. The plant thrives in cold, harsh environments and is often found in tundra and rocky areas. Thermophila has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its arctic habitat. It is also known for its ability to regenerate from its root system after being disturbed."
