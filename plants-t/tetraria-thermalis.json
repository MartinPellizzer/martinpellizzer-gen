    "intro": "Tetraria thermalis, commonly known as the thermal tetraria, is a unique plant species characterized by its specialized adaptations to high-temperature environments. It belongs to the family Tetrariaceae and is notable for its ability to thrive in geothermal areas where other plants struggle to survive. The plant's structure consists of small, compact leaves that are resistant to heat and desiccation. Its reproductive structures are highly modified, often forming spore-producing capsules that are resilient to extreme conditions. Tetraria thermalis plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native habitats, contributing to soil stabilization and supporting specialized microbial communities."
