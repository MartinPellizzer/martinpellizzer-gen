    "intro": "Taraxacum promptum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flower head. The plant produces a cluster of yellow flowers that develop into fluffy white seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It is native to Europe and has been naturalized in many parts of the world. Taraxacum promptum is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed soils, and is known for its medicinal and culinary uses."
