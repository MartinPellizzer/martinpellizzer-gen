    "intro": "Tragacantha galactites, commonly known as the Astragalus species, is a member of the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces a sticky, resinous substance known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and steppe regions. Tragacantha galactites plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
