    "intro": "Taraxacum malteanum, commonly known as the Maltean dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to parts of the Mediterranean region, including southern Europe and North Africa. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and a hairy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. It produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism with a pappus, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind. This species is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in temperate climates."
