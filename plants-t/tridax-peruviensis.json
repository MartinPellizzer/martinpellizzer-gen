    "intro": "Tridax peruviensis, commonly known as the common tridax, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and alternate leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. Tridax peruviensis is considered a weed in many regions due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
