    "intro": "Torilis radiata, commonly known as the common sandparsley, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small white or yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas. It produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Torilis radiata is generally non-invasive but can be considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
