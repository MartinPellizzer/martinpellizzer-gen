    "intro": "Tenicroa juncifolia, commonly known as the marsh clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant has whorled leaves that are typically narrow and grass-like, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces tiny, spore-bearing cones rather than flowers, which are clustered at the base of the plant. Tenicroa juncifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
