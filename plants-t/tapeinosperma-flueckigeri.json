It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family. The plant is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This species is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
