    "intro": "Tithymalus wulfenii, commonly known as the alpine tithymale, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. It is a perennial herb that thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in the Alps and Carpathian Mountains. Due to its habitat, it is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
