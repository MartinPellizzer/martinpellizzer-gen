    "intro": "Tanghinia maculata, commonly known as the spotted fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, dark spots. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Tanghinia maculata plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
