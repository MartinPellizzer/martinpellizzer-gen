    "intro": "Trichomanes rupicola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a member of the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds. It is typically found growing on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often in temperate regions. The plant has a compact growth habit with small, linear leaves that are often clustered closely together. Its reproductive structures, known as sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Trichomanes rupicola is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in specialized gardens or preserved in natural habitats."
