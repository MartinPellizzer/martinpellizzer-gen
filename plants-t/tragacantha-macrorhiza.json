    "intro": "Tragacantha macrorhiza, commonly known as the large-rooted tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its deep, extensive root system that allows it to thrive in arid and rocky soils. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by the development of its distinctive, sticky resin. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, contributing to its drought tolerance. The resin, known as tragacanth, has been historically used in medicine and as a gelling agent in food and pharmaceutical products."
