    "intro": "Triticum sativum var. durum, commonly known as durum wheat, is a variety of wheat characterized by its high gluten content and hard grain. It is primarily used for making semolina, which is essential in pasta and couscous production. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with spikelets containing 3 to 6 florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are small and clustered in spikes. Durum wheat is well adapted to dry and temperate climates, making it a staple crop in many regions."
