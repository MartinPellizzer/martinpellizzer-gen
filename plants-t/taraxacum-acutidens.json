    "intro": "Taraxacum acutidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a pappus-equipped seed sphere. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. It is known for its ability to spread rapidly through wind-dispersed seeds, making it a common weed in many regions."
