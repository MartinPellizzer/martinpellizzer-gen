    "intro": "Triticum boeoticum var. ilamicum, commonly known as wild einkorn, is a wild relative of domesticated wheat. It is a small, annual grass that typically grows in dry, rocky soils across the Mediterranean region. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or green flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in tough, protective husks, which make them difficult to process without specialized techniques. This variety is of interest to researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to harsh environments."
