    "intro": "Taraxacum foliosissimum, commonly known as the giant dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its large, spoon-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces a single, tall, hollow stem that supports a yellow flower head, which develops into a white, fluffy seed sphere. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This species is notable for its robust growth and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
