    "intro": "Triticum magellanicum var. glabrivalve, commonly known as the Magellan wheat, is a rare and native grass species found in the southern regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellow flowers, which are adapted to the harsh, cold climates of its native habitat. Its seeds are generally small and require specific environmental conditions for germination. Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
