    "intro": "Tunica rigida, commonly known as the rigid layer, is a specialized plant structure found in the outermost layer of the stem in certain plants. It is composed primarily of sclerenchyma cells, which are thick-walled and provide structural support. This layer plays a crucial role in protecting the inner tissues of the plant from mechanical damage and environmental stress. Tunica rigida is particularly prominent in dicotyledonous plants and is involved in the process of stem elongation during growth. Its rigidity and strength make it an essential component of the plant's overall architecture."
