It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces pink or violet flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as ground cover. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping and herbal use."
