    "intro": "Telipogon guacamayensis, commonly known as the Guanacaste orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often displaying vibrant colors such as yellow and green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Its morphology includes long, slender stems and lance-shaped leaves, adapted to its high-altitude habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited study, Telipogon guacamayensis remains poorly understood in terms of its ecological role and conservation status."
