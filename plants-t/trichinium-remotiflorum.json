    "intro": "Trichinium remotiflorum, commonly known as the distant-flower trichinium, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. It is primarily found in rocky soils and is often associated with alpine ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
