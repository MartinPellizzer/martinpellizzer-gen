    "intro": "Tillandsia supermexicana var. saxicola, commonly known as the rock tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in well-drained, rocky substrates and requires bright, indirect light. Its unique morphology and ability to absorb moisture from the air make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
