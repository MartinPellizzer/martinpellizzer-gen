    "intro": "Tragacantha askia, commonly known as the Askia gum arabic tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the Sahel region of Africa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its thick, woody trunk and dense foliage. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by the formation of pods containing a sticky, resinous substance known as gum arabic. This gum is harvested from the bark and is used in various industries, including food, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics. The plant is adapted to arid environments and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
