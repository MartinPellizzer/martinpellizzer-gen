    "intro": "Trichomanes splendidum, commonly known as the splendid maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on limestone substrates. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are closely clustered on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichomanes splendidum is considered an endangered species."
