    "intro": "Triticum sativum subsp. durum, commonly known as durum wheat, is a tetraploid species of wheat characterized by its high gluten content and hard grain. It is primarily cultivated for its durum semolina, which is used to make pasta and couscous. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow leaves and spike-like inflorescences bearing small, tough grains. Durum wheat is well adapted to dry and semi-arid climates, thriving in regions with moderate rainfall. Its genetic makeup includes contributions from wild wheat species, which have enhanced its resilience and yield potential."
