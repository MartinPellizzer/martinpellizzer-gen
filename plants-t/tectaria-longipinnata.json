    "intro": "Tectaria longipinnata, commonly known as the long-pinnate shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into long, slender pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, supporting the growth of its fronds. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
