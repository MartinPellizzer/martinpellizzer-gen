    "intro": "Trifolium rumelicum, commonly known as the alpine clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to heart-shaped leaflets, often with a white or pale green coloration. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Trifolium rumelicum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
