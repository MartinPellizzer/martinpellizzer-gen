    "intro": "Tillandsia sanctae-martae, commonly known as the Santa Marta air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Santa Marta Mountains in Colombia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, high-altitude environments. It produces striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom once in its lifetime. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
