    "intro": "Taraxacum halophilum, commonly known as the salt meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal and saline environments. It is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in soils with high salinity, making it an important component of salt marsh ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate saline conditions makes it a valuable indicator species for coastal habitats."
