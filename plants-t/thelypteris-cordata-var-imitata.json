It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features lance-shaped, glossy fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in wetland habitats."
