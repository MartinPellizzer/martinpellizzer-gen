    "intro": "Triallosia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant thrives in extreme desert conditions, relying on minimal water and high sunlight exposure. Its flowers bloom only at night, emitting a faint bioluminescent glow, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Triallosia is considered a conservation priority in its natural habitat."
