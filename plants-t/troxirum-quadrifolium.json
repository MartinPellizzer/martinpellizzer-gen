    "intro": "Troxirum quadrifolium, commonly known as the four-leaf clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that often form a rosette at the base. The plant produces delicate, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its rarity and symbolic significance, it is sometimes considered a symbol of good luck."
