It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, small flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. It is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the tepuis, which are isolated mountain ranges with distinct microclimates. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
