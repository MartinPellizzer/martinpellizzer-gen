    "intro": "Trichodesma arenicola subsp. concinnum, commonly known as the coastal trichodesma, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small shrub with compact, upright growth habit, typically reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months, usually from spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. This subspecies is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found growing in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops."
