    "intro": "Tectaria nicaraguensis, commonly known as the Nicaraguan shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees in humid, tropical environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain water in its natural habitat. Tectaria nicaraguensis is often found in cloud forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
