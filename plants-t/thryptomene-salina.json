    "intro": "Thryptomene salina, commonly known as saltbush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in saline or sandy soils, adapting to harsh coastal environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are often clustered at the ends of branches. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Thryptomene salina plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
