    "intro": "Tmesipteris oblanceolata subsp. linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The plant thrives in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring it in muddy or aquatic soils. The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproduction in moist habitats."
