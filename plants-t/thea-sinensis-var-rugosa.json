    "intro": "Thea sinensis var. rugosa, commonly known as the rough-leaf tea plant, is a variant of the Camellia sinensis species. It is characterized by its serrated, rough-textured leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. This plant is native to China and is cultivated for its leaves, which can be used to make various types of tea. The leaves of Thea sinensis var. rugosa are typically smaller and more compact compared to other tea varieties. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticultural practices."
