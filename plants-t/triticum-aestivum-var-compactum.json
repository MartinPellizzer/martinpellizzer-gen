    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. compactum, commonly known as compact wheat, is a variety of wheat characterized by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to standard wheat varieties. It is a hexaploid species, meaning it has six sets of chromosomes, which contributes to its genetic diversity and adaptability. The plant typically produces small, dense spikes with tightly packed grains, making it suitable for specific agricultural and breeding purposes. Its compact structure can reduce lodging, which is the tendency of plants to fall over, thereby improving harvest efficiency. This variety is often used in plant breeding programs to develop more resilient wheat strains."
