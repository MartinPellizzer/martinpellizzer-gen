    "intro": "Triplophyllum acutilobum, commonly known as the sharp-lobed h\u517b\u6210, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with sharply pointed lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically hidden within a fleshy, green structure called a cyathium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense undergrowth of tropical forests. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
