    "intro": "Tetradymia canescens var. linearis, commonly known as the linear tetradymia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sagebrush steppe and rocky soils. Its linear, gray-green leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, and it produces small yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. This variety is distinguished by its elongated leaf shape compared to the typical form of Tetradymia canescens."
