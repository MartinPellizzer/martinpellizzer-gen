    "intro": "Talauma gitingensis var. rotundata, commonly known as the round-leaf talauma, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and small trees. The plant is characterized by its distinctive round or ovate-shaped leaves, which are often glossy and have a smooth texture. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and it is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
