    "intro": "Trifolium campestre var. dertosense, commonly known as the Dertosense clover, is a variant of the common clover species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, typically consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation."
