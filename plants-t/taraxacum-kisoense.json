    "intro": "Taraxacum kisoense, commonly known as the Kiso dandelion, is a perennial herb native to Japan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a hollow, leafless stem. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy white seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and forest edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
