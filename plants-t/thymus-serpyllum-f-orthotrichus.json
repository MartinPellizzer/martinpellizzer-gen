It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and slightly pointed, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces tiny, pink to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its compact size and fragrant foliage make it a popular choice for both ornamental and medicinal use."
