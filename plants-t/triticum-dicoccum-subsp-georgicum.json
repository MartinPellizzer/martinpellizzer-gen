    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum subsp. georgicum, commonly known as Georgian emmer wheat, is a wild wheat species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and spikelets that are typically shorter than those of other emmer wheat varieties. The plant produces small, tough grains that are encased in a tough hull, which is a defining feature of the Triticeae tribe. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest for breeding programs aimed at improving modern wheat varieties."
