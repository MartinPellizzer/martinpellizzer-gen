    "intro": "Tillandsia hahnii, commonly known as the silver sword, is a species of air plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in shaded, humid environments. Its striking silver-blue foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and as a decorative plant."
