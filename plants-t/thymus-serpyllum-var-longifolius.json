    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. longifolius, commonly known as long-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically longer than those of the standard thymus serpyllum. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and fragrant foliage make it a valuable plant for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
