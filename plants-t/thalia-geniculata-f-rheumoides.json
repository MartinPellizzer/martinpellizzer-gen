    "intro": "Thalia geniculata f. rheumoides, commonly known as the Rheumoid form of the sea holly, is a rare and unique variant of the sea holly species. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, waxy leaves that are often tinged with a reddish hue. This form exhibits a more robust growth habit compared to the typical sea holly, with a greater concentration of succulent tissue. The plant is native to coastal regions and thrives in saline or alkaline soils. Its botanical interest lies in its structural adaptations to coastal environments and its distinct morphological features."
