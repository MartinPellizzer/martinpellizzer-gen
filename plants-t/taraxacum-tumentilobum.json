    "intro": "Taraxacum tumentilobum, commonly known as the swollen dandelion, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive swollen, bulbous base that stores nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in poor soil conditions. The plant produces a single, upright stem with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy. Its yellow flower head consists of many small florets that bloom in the spring and summer. This species is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils across temperate regions."
