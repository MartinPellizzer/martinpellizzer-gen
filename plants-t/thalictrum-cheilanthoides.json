    "intro": "Thalictrum cheilanthoides, commonly known as the fernleaf meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply divided and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces showy, clustered yellow flowers in early spring, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its root system is fibrous and helps it thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Thalictrum cheilanthoides is often found in meadows and along streambanks, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
