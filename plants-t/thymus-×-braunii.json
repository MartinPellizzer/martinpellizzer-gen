    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 braunii, commonly known as the Braun's thyme, is a hybrid species within the Thymus genus, characterized by its aromatic, small, needle-like leaves and clusters of pink to lavender flowers. It is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe, particularly found in rocky and limestone soils. The plant produces essential oils rich in thymol and carvacrol, contributing to its strong fragrance and medicinal uses. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and herbal cultivation. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it both a useful plant for landscaping and a valuable source of aromatic compounds."
