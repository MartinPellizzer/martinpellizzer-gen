    "intro": "Thelypteris andina, commonly known as the Andean shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Andes Mountains. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Thelypteris andina plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native range."
