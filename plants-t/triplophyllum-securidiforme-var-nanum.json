    "intro": "Triplophyllum securidiforme var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf fan-leaf cycad, is a small, slow-growing cycad native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like foliage composed of narrow, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of cycads, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its unique morphology and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its conservation status, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
