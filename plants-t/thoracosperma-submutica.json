    "intro": "Thoracosperma submutica, commonly known as the rough-leaved mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to coastal areas of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, fuzzy hairs. It thrives in brackish water environments, often forming dense thickets in mangrove swamps. Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
