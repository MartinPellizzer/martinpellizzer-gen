    "intro": "Tectaria heptaphylla, commonly known as the seven-leaf tectaria, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into seven pairs of lanceolate pinnae, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, a feature typical of many ferns. Tectaria heptaphylla is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid conditions."
