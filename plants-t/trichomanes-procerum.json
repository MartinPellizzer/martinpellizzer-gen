    "intro": "Trichomanes procerum, commonly known as the tall maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green and have a finely divided structure. This plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds. Trichomanes procerum is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
