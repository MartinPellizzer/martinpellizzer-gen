It features slender, branched stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early to mid-summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
