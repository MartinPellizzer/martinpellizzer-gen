    "intro": "Thelypteris palauensis, commonly known as the Palau fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly in Palau and surrounding islands. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales, which help in water retention and nutrient absorption. Thelypteris palauensis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
