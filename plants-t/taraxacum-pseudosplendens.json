    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudosplendens, commonly known as the golden dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets and a distinctive, hollow, hairless stem. The plant produces a spherical seed head that disperses seeds via wind, a common adaptation in the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Its botanical features make it a hardy and widespread species in temperate regions."
