It features slender, upright stems that bear compound leaves with finely divided, feathery lobes. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
