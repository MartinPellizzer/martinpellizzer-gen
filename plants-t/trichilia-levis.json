    "intro": "Trichilia levis, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Trichilia levis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and woodland areas."
