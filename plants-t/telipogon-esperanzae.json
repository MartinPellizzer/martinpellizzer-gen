    "intro": "Telipogon esperanzae, commonly known as the Esperanza orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Andean regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments. Its growth is often limited to rocky soils and moist microhabitats, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Telipogon esperanzae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
