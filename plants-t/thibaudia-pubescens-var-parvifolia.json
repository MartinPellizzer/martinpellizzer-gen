    "intro": "Thibaudia pubescens var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved thibaudia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
