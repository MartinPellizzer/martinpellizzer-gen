    "intro": "Thymelaea dendrobryum, commonly known as the rock thyme. It is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa, characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, and it produces clusters of yellow or white flowers during the spring. Thymelaea dendrobryum is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
