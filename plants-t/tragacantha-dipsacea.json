It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. Its most notable feature is the production of a valuable gum, which has been historically used in medicine and as a natural adhesive. Tragacantha dipsacea thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions with its deep root system."
