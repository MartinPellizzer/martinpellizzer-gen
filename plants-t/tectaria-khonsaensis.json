    "intro": "Tectaria khonsaensis, commonly known as the Khonsa shield fern, is a rare and unique species native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are tightly clasped around the stem. The plant exhibits a monomorphic growth pattern, with all fronds arising from a single point at the base. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it thrive in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
