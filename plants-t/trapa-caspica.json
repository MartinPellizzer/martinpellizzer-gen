    "intro": "Trapa caspica, commonly known as the Caspian water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to the Caspian Sea region. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, followed by distinctive seed pods that split open to release buoyant seeds. Trapa caspica is adapted to still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its structure and reproductive strategy make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
