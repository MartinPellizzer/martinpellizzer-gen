    "intro": "Tragacantha pycnocephala, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and dense, woody crown. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its most notable feature is the production of a thick, sticky resin known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a natural gum. The plant is adapted to survive in dry, hot climates with minimal water availability."
