    "intro": "Tiglium officinale, commonly known as the greater spurge, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually green with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, egg-shaped seed capsules. Tiglium officinale contains toxic compounds, including tiglic acid, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in roadsides, meadows, and waste areas."
