    "intro": "Tillandsia fassettii, commonly known as the Fassett's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with long, narrow leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
