    "intro": "Thelypteris yahanensis, commonly known as the Yahan holly fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically evergreen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Thelypteris yahanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining forest biodiversity."
