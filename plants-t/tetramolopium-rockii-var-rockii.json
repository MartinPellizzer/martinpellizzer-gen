    "intro": "Tetramolopium rockii var. rockii, commonly known as the desert ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish to reddish-purple flowers. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. This species is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
