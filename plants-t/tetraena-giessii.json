    "intro": "Tetraena giessii, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers during the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its bark is often fissured and covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. Tetraena giessii is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
