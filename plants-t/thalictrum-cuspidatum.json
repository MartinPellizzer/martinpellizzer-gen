    "intro": "Thalictrum cuspidatum, commonly known as the prickly custardroot, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white, spiky flowers that bloom in early to mid-summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and prefers moist, well-drained soils in partial to full shade. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for woodland gardens and naturalized landscapes. Thalictrum cuspidatum is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small insects."
