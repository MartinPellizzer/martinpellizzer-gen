    "intro": "Trifolium thalii, commonly known as the Thalii clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. This plant is native to certain regions of Europe and is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. Trifolium thalii is known for its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. It plays a role in soil enrichment due to its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
