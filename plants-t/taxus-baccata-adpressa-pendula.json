    "intro": "Taxus baccata adpressa-pendula, commonly known as the creeping yew or pendulous yew, is a unique variant of the European yew. This plant is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with dense, dark green foliage. The leaves are needle-like, measuring approximately 1 to 2 centimeters in length, and are arranged in a compact, spreading pattern. It produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for ground cover in shaded areas."
