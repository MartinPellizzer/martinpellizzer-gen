It is characterized by its delicate, wiry stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Trichophyllum tenue is known for its ability to thrive in humid conditions and is often found in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, called capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature."
