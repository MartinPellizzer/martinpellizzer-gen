    "intro": "Trichera adriatica, commonly known as the Adriatic trichera, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Adriatic Sea. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces delicate white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
