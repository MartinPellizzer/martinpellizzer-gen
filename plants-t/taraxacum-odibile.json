It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, toothed leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that bears a bright yellow flower head. The flower head develops into a fluffy white sphere of seeds, which are easily dispersed by the wind. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas. It has a long flowering period, typically from early spring to late summer."
