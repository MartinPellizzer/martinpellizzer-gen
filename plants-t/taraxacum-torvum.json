    "intro": "Taraxacum torvum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lanceolate, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, inconspicuous yellow flower head. The flower head develops into a distinctive spherical seed head, known as a pappus, which is equipped with fine hairs to aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas. The plant is known for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it a potential indicator species for soil contamination."
