    "intro": "Trigonella villosa, commonly known as hairy fenugreek, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branched stems covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by kidney-shaped pods containing several seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Trigonella villosa is often grown for its seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a spice."
