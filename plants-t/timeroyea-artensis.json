    "intro": "Timeroyea artensis, commonly known as the Artensian flameleaf, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking red and orange foliage, which becomes more vibrant during the cooler months. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soil and requires a cool, humid climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
