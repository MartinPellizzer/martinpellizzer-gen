    "intro": "Trifolium nervulosum, commonly known as the veined clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with prominent veins. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Trifolium nervulosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
