    "intro": "Trichochloa alpestris, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves covered in short, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and mountainous areas. Trichochloa alpestris is an important component of alpine vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
