    "intro": "Tillandsia albertiana, commonly known as the Albert's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than roots. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are typically silver-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences that can range in color from white to pink or purple. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
