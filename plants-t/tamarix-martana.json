    "intro": "Tamarix martana, commonly known as the white tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces fluffy, pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Tamarix martana is well adapted to arid and saline soils, making it a hardy plant in dry environments. It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in degraded areas."
