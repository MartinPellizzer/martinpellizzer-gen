    "intro": "Tapiphyllum cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-gray tapiphyllum, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that have a distinctive ash-gray hue on the upper surface. Its flowers are typically pink to purple in color and are clustered in inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
