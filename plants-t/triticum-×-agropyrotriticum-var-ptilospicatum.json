It is characterized by its tall stature, typically reaching heights of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, two-lobed florets that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its roots form a dense network, contributing to soil stabilization and erosion control. This variety is valued for its hardiness and potential use in sustainable agriculture and forage production."
