    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. leucura, commonly known as white wheat, is a variety of wheat characterized by its pale, often white or light-colored grain. This variety is typically shorter and more compact than common wheat, with a lower protein content, making it suitable for certain types of flour. The plant has a robust root system and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear the grains. It is primarily cultivated for its high yield and adaptability to various climates. Its botanical features make it distinct from other wheat varieties, particularly in its grain color and growth habits."
