    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum var. chvamlicum, commonly known as hulled barley, is a variety of the wild barley species native to the Fertile Crescent. It is characterized by its tough, inedible hull that encases the grain, distinguishing it from other barley types. This plant typically grows in temperate regions and has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in various soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, two-lobed flowers in panicles. The plant is valued for its hardiness and historical significance in early agricultural practices."
