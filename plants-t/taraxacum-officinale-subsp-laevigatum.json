    "intro": "Taraxacum officinale subsp. laevigatum, commonly known as the smooth dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, smooth-edged leaves. It produces a hollow, leafless stem that terminates in a bright yellow composite flower head, which develops into a spherical seed head with pappus for wind dispersal. The plant is native to Europe and has been naturalized in many parts of the world, including North America. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. The smooth dandelion is known for its medicinal properties, including diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects."
