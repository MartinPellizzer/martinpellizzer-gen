    "intro": "Topirira fasciculata, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible but have a sharp, acidic taste. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
