    "intro": "Tillandsia decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant that absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through soil. Native to Central and South America, it thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that collect water and have a waxy coating to reduce evaporation. Its striking, long-lasting inflorescence makes it a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural purposes."
