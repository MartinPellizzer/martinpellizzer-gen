    "intro": "Trichoglottis heidemaniana, commonly known as the Heideman's orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a challenging species for cultivation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often sought after by orchid enthusiasts."
