    "intro": "Talisia tiricensis, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a shrub native to parts of Central America and the Caribbean. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces bright purple berries that are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally considered toxic to humans. Talisia tiricensis typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its ornamental value is often appreciated in horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique fruiting display."
