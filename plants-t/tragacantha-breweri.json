    "intro": "Tragacantha breweri, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its latex sap is a key component in the production of tragacanth, a natural gum used in various industrial applications."
