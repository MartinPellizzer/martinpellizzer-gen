This species is characterized by its short, ribbed stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are borne on short, lateral pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a sought-after species among cactus enthusiasts and botanists."
