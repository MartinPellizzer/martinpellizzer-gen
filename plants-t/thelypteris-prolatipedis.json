    "intro": "Thelypteris prolatipedis, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its slender, elongated fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, fuzzy hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a network of roots that help anchor it to the substrate. Thelypteris prolatipedis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like appearance."
