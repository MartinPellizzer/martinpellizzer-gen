    "intro": "Tetranthera chartacea var. nervosa, commonly known as the veined sheet fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often veined with a distinct, visible network of vascular tissue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its fronds are often used in traditional medicine. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
