    "intro": "Thelypteris mengeniana, commonly known as the Mengen's holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in humid conditions. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are covered in tiny, rounded structures called sorus."
