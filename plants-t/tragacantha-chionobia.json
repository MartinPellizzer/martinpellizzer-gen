    "intro": "Tragacantha chionobia, commonly known as the snowtragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a distinctive resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Tragacantha chionobia thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments."
