    "intro": "Telipogon tayacajaensis, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Peruvian Andes. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in cloud forests. Its botanical features include a short, erect stem with a single or few leaves, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
