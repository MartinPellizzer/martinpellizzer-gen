    "intro": "Trianea neovisae, commonly known as the Visayan violet, is a flowering plant native to the Visayas region of the Philippines. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, violet-colored flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, thriving in humid tropical climates. Its small, clustered flowers bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trianea neovisae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
