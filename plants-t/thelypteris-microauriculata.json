    "intro": "Thelypteris microauriculata, commonly known as the small-auricle fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across suitable habitats. The small, rounded auricles on the fronds are a distinguishing feature of this species."
