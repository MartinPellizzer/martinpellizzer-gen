    "intro": "Tephroseris tundricola, commonly known as the tundra saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Tephroseris tundricola plays an important ecological role in tundra ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing food for herbivores."
