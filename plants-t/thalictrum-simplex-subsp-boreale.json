    "intro": "Thalictrum simplex subsp. boreale, commonly known as the northern meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to northern regions of North America. It features slender, upright stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in compound umbels, typically blooming in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and native plant gardens."
