    "intro": "Tilia caroliniana subsp. heterophylla, commonly known as the Carolina basswood, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that vary in size and shape, giving it the subspecies name *heterophylla*, meaning \"different leaves.\" The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping catkins. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
