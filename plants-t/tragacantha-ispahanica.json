It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by pods containing small, round seeds. Its most notable feature is the production of a viscous gum, which has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive.
