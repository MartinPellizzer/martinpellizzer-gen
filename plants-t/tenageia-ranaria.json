    "intro": "Tenageia ranaria, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. The plant features fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Tenageia ranaria plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
