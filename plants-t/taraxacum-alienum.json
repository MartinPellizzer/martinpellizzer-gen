    "intro": "Taraxacum alienum, commonly known as the alien dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive seed dispersal mechanism. The plant features a basal rosette of broad, serrated leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports its yellow flower head. Its flowers develop into fluffy white pappus-bearing seeds, facilitating wind pollination and seed dispersal. The species is notable for its adaptability to various soil types and its role in ecological succession."
