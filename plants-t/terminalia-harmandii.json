It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmate leaves that are usually alternate. The tree produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, red fruits. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
