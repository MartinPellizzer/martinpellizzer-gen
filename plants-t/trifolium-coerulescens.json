    "intro": "Trifolium coerulescens, commonly known as blue clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
