    "intro": "Tapeinosperma tchingouense, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It is often found in forested areas and is valued for its hard, durable wood. However, it is considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
