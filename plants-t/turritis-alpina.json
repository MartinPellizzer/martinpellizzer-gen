    "intro": "Turritis alpina, commonly known as the alpine turritis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its preference for high-altitude environments, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
