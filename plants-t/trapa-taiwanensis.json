    "intro": "Trapa taiwanensis, commonly known as the Taiwan water chestnut, is a species of aquatic plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves and spiny, floating fruits that contain seeds. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and rounded, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The fruit, which resembles a small, spiky sphere, is an important food source for various waterfowl and aquatic animals."
