    "intro": "Triticum emarginatum, commonly known as the fringed wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, awned flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed areas. Triticum emarginatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
