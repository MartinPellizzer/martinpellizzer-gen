It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are leathery and have a slightly aromatic scent, while its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds.
