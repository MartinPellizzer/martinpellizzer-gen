    "intro": "Trixis verbasciformis var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smoothleaf trixis, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage is generally smooth and lacks the hairy texture seen in other varieties of the species. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
