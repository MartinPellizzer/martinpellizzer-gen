    "intro": "Tremacron aurantiacum var. weiningense, commonly known as the Weining golden bell, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth surface, and the stems are woody and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
