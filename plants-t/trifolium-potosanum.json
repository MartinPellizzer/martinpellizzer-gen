    "intro": "Trifolium potosanum, commonly known as the Potosan clover, is a rare and endemic species native to Germany. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trifolium potosanum is considered a conservation concern."
