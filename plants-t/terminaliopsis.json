    "intro": "Terminaliopsis, commonly known as the \"Spoonleaf\" or \"Terminaliopsis tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Arecaceae, native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive, spoon-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with a rugged, woody stem and dense foliage. Terminaliopsis species are valued for their ornamental appearance and are sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens. Due to habitat loss, several species within this genus are considered threatened or endangered."
