    "intro": "Tithymalus atlantis, commonly known as the Atlantis tithymalus, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple, often clustered in compact inflorescences. Its leaves are usually opposite and elliptical, with a smooth surface and a slightly glossy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tithymalus atlantis is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
