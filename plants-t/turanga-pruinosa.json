    "intro": "Turanga pruinosa, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often with a subtle iridescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
