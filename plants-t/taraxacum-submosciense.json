    "intro": "Taraxacum submosciense, commonly known as the Moscian dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is native to parts of Europe and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant produces a distinctive seed head with white, wind-dispersed seeds. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species in some regions."
