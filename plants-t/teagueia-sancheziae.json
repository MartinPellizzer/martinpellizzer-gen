    "intro": "Teagueia sancheziae, commonly known as the Sanchezia cycad, is a rare and ancient cycad species native to the island of La Gomera in the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically green when immature and turn brown as they mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and ecologically significant species."
