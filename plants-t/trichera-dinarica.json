    "intro": "Trichera dinarica, commonly known as the Dinaric trichera, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the Dinaric Alps. It is a herbaceous plant with slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the top of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, mountainous climate of its native region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
