    "intro": "Trichopteryx, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs. The leaves are typically ovate or lanceolate and have a distinctive waxy texture. Trichopteryx species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. They produce small, pale flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, and their fruits are capsules that release seeds through mechanical means."
