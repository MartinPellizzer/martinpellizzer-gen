    "intro": "Taraxacum brachysquameum, commonly known as the short-scale dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that produces a single, bright yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. Its flowers develop into a spherical seed head with pappus-equipped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Taraxacum brachysquameum is notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resilience to environmental stress."
