    "intro": "Turpinia occidentalis subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the western turpentine bush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that emit a strong turpentine scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange to red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
