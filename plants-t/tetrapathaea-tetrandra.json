It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
