    "intro": "Tillandsia pomacochae, commonly known as the Andean air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps to collect and retain moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white, pink, or purple. Tillandsia pomacochae is adapted to cool, humid environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth."
