    "intro": "Tromotriche thudichumii, commonly known as the Thudichum's tromotriche, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its unique, spiky, yellow-orange inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Tromotriche thudichumii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
