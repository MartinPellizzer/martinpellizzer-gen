    "intro": "Thelypodium flexicaule, commonly known as the flexible thelypodium, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of its family, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Thelypodium flexicaule is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
