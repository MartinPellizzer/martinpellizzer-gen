    "intro": "Trichomanes axillare var. helicoideum, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features narrow, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often curled in a spiral arrangement, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
