    "intro": "Triodon polymorphus var. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved triodon, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its diminutive, elliptical leaves. It belongs to the family Triuridaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with short, creeping stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked. Its leaves are densely packed, providing a dense ground cover that aids in soil stabilization. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
