    "intro": "Toxicodendron laurinum, commonly known as the sumac tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with 9 to 15 leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by red, fuzzy berries that persist into winter. It is often found in moist, wooded areas and can grow up to 10 meters in height. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic and can cause skin irritation upon contact."
