    "intro": "Tenicroa nana, commonly known as the dwarf tenicroa, is a small flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
