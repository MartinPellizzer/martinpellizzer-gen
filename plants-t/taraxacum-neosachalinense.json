    "intro": "Taraxacum neosachalinense, commonly known as the Sakhalin dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the Russian Far East, specifically the island of Sakhalin, and is adapted to temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that blooms in the summer. It produces a distinctive, hollow stem with a milky sap, typical of the dandelion genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
