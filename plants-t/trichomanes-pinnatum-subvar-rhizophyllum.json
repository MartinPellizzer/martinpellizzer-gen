    "intro": "Trichomanes pinnatum subvar. rhizophyllum, commonly known as the rhizophyllum fern, is a rare and specialized fern species characterized by its unique rhizome structure. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is typically found in humid, shaded environments such as tropical rainforests. The plant exhibits intricate frond morphology with finely divided, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
