    "intro": "Toxicodendron griffithii var. griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to parts of Asia, particularly India. It is characterized by its compound leaves, typically consisting of three leaflets, which are often arranged oppositely along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. It is known for its potent urushiol oil, which can cause severe skin irritation and allergic reactions in humans. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in both natural and cultivated settings."
