It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and distinctive, fluffy inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its slender, wiry stems and soft, feathery appearance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The species is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
