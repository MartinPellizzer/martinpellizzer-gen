    "intro": "Taraxacum lacerabile, commonly known as the broken dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant's scientific name reflects its tendency to have torn or damaged leaves, often due to herbivory or environmental stress. It is a perennial species that spreads via rhizomes and is often found in meadows and along roadsides."
