    "intro": "Triticum fibrosum, commonly known as the fibrous wheat, is a lesser-known species within the wheat genus. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, narrow leaves, which are covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, hard grains, typical of many cereal species. It is often found in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its fibrous structure, it has been historically used for both grain and fiber production."
