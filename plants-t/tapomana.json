    "intro": "Tapomana, commonly known as the sacred orchid, is a rare and ethically significant plant found in the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in a variety of hues, including white, pink, and purple. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and is traditionally used in Ayurvedic practices for its purported healing benefits. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as endangered, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat. Its cultural and ecological importance makes it a symbol of resilience and spiritual significance in local communities."
