    "intro": "Tectaria psomiocarpa, commonly known as the Psomiocarpa shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive shield-like shape. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to organic matter. Tectaria psomiocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
