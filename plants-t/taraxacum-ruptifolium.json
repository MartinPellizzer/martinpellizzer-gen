    "intro": "Taraxacum ruptifolium, commonly known as the broken-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are often deeply lobed or dissected, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces a single, hollow stem that supports a yellow flower head, which develops into a white, fluffy seed sphere. Native to regions of Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its unique leaf morphology, it is sometimes mistaken for other dandelion species but can be distinguished by its irregularly fragmented foliage."
