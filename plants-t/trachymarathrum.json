    "intro": "Trachymarathrum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, spiky flowers and succulent leaves, which help them retain water in arid environments. They are native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands, where they thrive in salty, well-drained soils. Trachymarathrum species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their unique appearance and drought tolerance. The flowers typically bloom in shades of blue, purple, and white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
