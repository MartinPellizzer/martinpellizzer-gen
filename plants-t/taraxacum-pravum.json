    "intro": "Taraxacum pravum, commonly known as the pale dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, slender stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a parachute-like structure called a pappus. It is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. Taraxacum pravum is a perennial herb that is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
