    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. citriodorus, commonly known as lemon thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features aromatic, slightly hairy leaves that emit a fresh lemon scent when crushed. The plant produces small, pink to lavender flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover. Lemon thyme is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, particularly in herbal teas and seasoning."
