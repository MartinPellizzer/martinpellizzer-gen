    "intro": "Tamonea humilis, commonly known as the dwarf tamonea, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
