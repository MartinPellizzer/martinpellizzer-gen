    "intro": "Timonius kostermansii, commonly known as the Kostermans' timonius, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories, where it relies on specific soil conditions for survival. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth surface, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Timonius kostermansii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
