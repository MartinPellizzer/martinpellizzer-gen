    "intro": "Trematolobelia haleakalaensis, commonly known as Haleakala trematolobelia, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to the specific environmental conditions of Haleakala's high-altitude habitat, including its rocky soils and cool, moist climate. It is known for its small, clustered growth habit and is considered a critically endangered species due to habitat loss and limited distribution. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this rare botanical treasure."
