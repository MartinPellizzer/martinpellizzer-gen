    "intro": "Trifolium pratense var. frigidum, commonly known as frost clover, is a variant of red clover that exhibits adaptations to colder climates. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides in temperate regions. Its growth is typically shorter and more compact compared to the standard red clover, making it suitable for colder environments. Frost clover is valued for its hardiness and role in soil stabilization and forage production."
