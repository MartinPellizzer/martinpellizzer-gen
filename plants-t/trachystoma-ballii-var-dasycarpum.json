    "intro": "Trachystoma ballii var. dasycarpum, commonly known as the woolly mountain lily, is a perennial herb native to the high elevations of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against cold temperatures. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late summer. Its stems are often hairy and can grow up to several feet tall, supporting the heavy flower clusters. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in cool, moist garden environments."
