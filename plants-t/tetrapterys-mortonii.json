    "intro": "Tetrapterys mortonii, commonly known as Morton's tetrapterys, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, lowland areas. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into five to seven lobes, and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, moist climate for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
