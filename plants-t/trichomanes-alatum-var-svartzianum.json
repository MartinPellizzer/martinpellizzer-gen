    "intro": "Trichomanes alatum var. svartzianum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically broad and lance-shaped. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread along the forest floor. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a distinct, elegant appearance that resembles the wings of a bird. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions."
