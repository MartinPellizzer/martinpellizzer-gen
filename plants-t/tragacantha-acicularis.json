    "intro": "Tragacantha acicularis, commonly known as the needletragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its spiny, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a unique, sticky resin known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a food thickener. Its leaves are narrow and needle-like, giving it its common name, and it thrives in dry, rocky soils. Tragacantha acicularis is often found in coastal and arid environments, where it adapts well to harsh conditions."
