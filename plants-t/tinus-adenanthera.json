    "intro": "Tinus adenanthera, commonly known as the Natal ironwood, is a large, evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and robust, fissured bark that provides protection against fire and pests. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a hardy species. The wood of Tinus adenanthera is highly valued for its strength and durability, though it is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
