The plants are typically herbaceous, with alternate, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that resemble those of the dandelion. Tomanthera species often grow in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. They are characterized by their milky sap and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
