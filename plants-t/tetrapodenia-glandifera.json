It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by woody fruits containing elliptical seeds. It is valued for its hard, aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and furniture. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
