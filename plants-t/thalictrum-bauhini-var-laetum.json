    "intro": "Thalictrum bauhini var. laetum, commonly known as the showy meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with a slender stem that is often branched. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and subtle, airy floral display."
