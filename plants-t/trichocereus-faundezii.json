    "intro": "Trichocereus faundezii, commonly known as the San Pedro cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces white to pale purple flowers during the warmer months, typically in the evening. Its stems are covered in spines, which are often more pronounced on the lower parts of the plant. Trichocereus faundezii is also known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of mescaline."
