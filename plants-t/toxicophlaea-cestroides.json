    "intro": "Toxicophlaea cestroides, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity and well-drained soil to flourish. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Toxicophlaea cestroides is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
