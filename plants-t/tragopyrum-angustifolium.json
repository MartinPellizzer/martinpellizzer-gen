    "intro": "Tragopyrum angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf wild oat, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations. Tragopyrum angustifolium is also considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its competitive growth habit."
