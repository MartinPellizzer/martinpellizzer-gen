    "intro": "Trisetum rosei, commonly known as the roseless false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, pale green to brownish flowers. Trisetum rosei thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some gardens, though it is primarily valued for its ecological role in stabilizing slopes and providing habitat for invertebrates."
