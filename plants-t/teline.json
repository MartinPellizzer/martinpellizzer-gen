    "intro": "Teline, commonly known as the teline or teline grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, narrow leaves. Teline species are typically found in temperate regions and thrive in well-drained soils. They produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. These plants are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
