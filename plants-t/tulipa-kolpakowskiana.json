    "intro": "Tulipa kolpakowskiana, commonly known as the Kolpakovsky tulip, is a rare and striking perennial bulbous plant native to Turkey. It is characterized by its large, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a contrasting eye. The plant produces strap-like leaves that are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a bulbous stem. It blooms in late spring to early summer, adding a dramatic visual impact to gardens. Due to its limited natural range and susceptibility to habitat loss, it is considered a conservation concern."
