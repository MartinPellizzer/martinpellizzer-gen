It is a perennial herb that forms dense, compact clumps with silver-gray leaves. The plant produces bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue or purple, depending on the variety. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and long blooming period."
