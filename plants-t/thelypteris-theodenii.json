    "intro": "Thelypteris theodenii, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a golden hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps it anchor in soil and absorb nutrients. Thelypteris theodenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
