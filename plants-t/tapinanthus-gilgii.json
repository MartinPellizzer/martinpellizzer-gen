    "intro": "Tapinanthus gilgii, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. Its leaves are alternate and often have a velvety texture. Tapinanthus gilgii is known for its rapid growth and can be invasive in certain environments."
