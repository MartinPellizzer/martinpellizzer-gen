    "intro": "Taxus expansa, commonly known as the Japanese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its dark green, flat, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals around the stems. The plant produces small, reddish-purple berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Taxus expansa is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its dense, compact form. It also contains taxine alkaloids, which have been studied for potential medicinal applications."
