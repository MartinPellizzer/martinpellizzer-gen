    "intro": "Triticum zea, commonly known as corn or maize, is a tall annual grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its tall stem, which can grow up to 5 meters in height, and its distinctive tassel-like inflorescence. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into kernels enclosed in a hard pericarp. Its leaves are long, narrow, and have a prominent midrib, while its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize the plant. Triticum zea is a major crop worldwide, valued for its high yield and versatility in food and industrial uses."
