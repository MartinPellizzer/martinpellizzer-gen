    "intro": "Tessaranthium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tessara, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in late spring, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or borders. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and ecological landscapes."
