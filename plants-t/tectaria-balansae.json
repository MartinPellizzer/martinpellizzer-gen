It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its soft, hairy fronds that give it a velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate structure that allows it to thrive in humid conditions.
