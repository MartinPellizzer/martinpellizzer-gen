    "intro": "Trifolium badium, commonly known as lesser clover, is a low-growing perennial herb belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a slender stem. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in early spring. Trifolium badium is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
