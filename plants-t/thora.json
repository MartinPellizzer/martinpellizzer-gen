It is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves, which are typically alternate and ovate in shape. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often blooming in late summer. Its fruit is a toxic berry that turns from green to yellow or red as it matures. Thora is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
