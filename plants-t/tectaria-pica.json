    "intro": "Tectaria pica, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety spores. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, tropical environments. Its fronds are usually divided into several segments, with a unique pattern of veins that aid in water retention. Tectaria pica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
