    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. durum, commonly known as durum wheat, is a variety of wheat characterized by its high gluten content and hard, tough grains. It is primarily cultivated for the production of semolina, which is used in making pasta and couscous. The plant has a robust growth habit with tall, sturdy stalks and spikelets that bear the hard, amber-colored grains. Its botanical features include a well-developed root system and a flowering period that typically occurs in the late spring to early summer. Durum wheat is adapted to a variety of climates but thrives in temperate regions with adequate sunlight and moderate rainfall."
