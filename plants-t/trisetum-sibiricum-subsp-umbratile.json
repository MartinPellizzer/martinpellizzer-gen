    "intro": "Trisetum sibiricum subsp. umbratile, commonly known as the shade-loving fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. This subspecies thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated."
