It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy on both surfaces. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds. This subspecies is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience."
