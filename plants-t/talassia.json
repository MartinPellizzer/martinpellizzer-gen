    "intro": "Talassia, commonly known as sea hibiscus, is a tropical flowering plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant is native to coastal regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, where it thrives in saline and sandy soils. Talassia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate coastal conditions. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological balance in its habitat."
