    "intro": "Torilis coerulescens, commonly known as blueweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its blue to purple flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves. Torilis coerulescens is often considered a weed but has some ornamental value due to its delicate appearance."
