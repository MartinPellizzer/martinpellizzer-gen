    "intro": "Trichoscypha arborea, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and long, narrow leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing a single seed. It is valued for its hard, heavy timber, which is used in furniture and construction. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
