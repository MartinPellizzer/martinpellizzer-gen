    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. venosus, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and densely packed, giving it a dense, carpet-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, pale pink to white flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, contribute to its use in herbal medicine and culinary applications."
