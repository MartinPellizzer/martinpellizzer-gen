    "intro": "Trisetum pratense, commonly known as meadow oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained to moderately wet soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Trisetum pratense plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
