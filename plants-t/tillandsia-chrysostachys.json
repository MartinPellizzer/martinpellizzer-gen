    "intro": "Tillandsia chrysostachys, commonly known as the golden rosette air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a leafy, epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. The plant forms dense, rosette-shaped clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the center of the rosette. It thrives in humid, well-lit environments and requires minimal soil, making it a popular choice for terrariums and hanging gardens."
