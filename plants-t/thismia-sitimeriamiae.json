    "intro": "Thismia sitimeriamiae, commonly known as the New Guinea ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the highland regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Thismiaceae, a group of plants known for their unique and often bizarre floral structures. The plant is characterized by its lack of true leaves, relying instead on its elongated, leaf-like stems for photosynthesis. Its flowers are small, white, and emit a faint, sometimes unpleasant odor, which is thought to attract specific insect pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, this species is highly vulnerable to environmental changes and is considered endangered."
