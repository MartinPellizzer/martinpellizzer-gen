    "intro": "Triticum durum var. falcatoapulicum, commonly known as the Apulian durum wheat, is a variety of durum wheat characterized by its distinctive leaf shape and growth habit. It is native to the southern regions of Italy, particularly the Apulia region, where it has been cultivated for centuries. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, with narrow, sword-shaped leaves and a compact inflorescence. Its grains are hard and high in protein, making it ideal for producing semolina used in pasta and couscous. This variety is valued for its adaptability to dry conditions and its historical significance in Mediterranean agriculture."
