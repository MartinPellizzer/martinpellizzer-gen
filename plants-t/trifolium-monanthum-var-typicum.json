    "intro": "Trifolium monanthum var. typicum, commonly known as the single-flowered clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems as a source of nectar for pollinators."
