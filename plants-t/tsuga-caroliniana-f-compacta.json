    "intro": "Tsuga caroliniana f. compacta, commonly known as the Carolina hemlock dwarf form, is a compact variant of the eastern hemlock. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and slow growth rate, making it suitable for small spaces. The foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and silvery white underneath. It is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in moist, acidic soils. This form is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to create a dense, evergreen cover."
