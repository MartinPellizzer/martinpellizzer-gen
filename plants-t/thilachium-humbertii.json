    "intro": "Thilachium humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's torch cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can reach heights of up to 5 meters. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. Thilachium humbertii is adapted to extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
