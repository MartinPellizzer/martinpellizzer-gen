It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with hairy margins. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
