It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Taraxacum exacutum is a hardy perennial that thrives in a variety of environmental conditions."
