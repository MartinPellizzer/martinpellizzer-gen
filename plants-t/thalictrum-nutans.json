    "intro": "Thalictrum nutans, commonly known as nodding meadow-rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, branched stems that rise from a short rhizome, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, with showy, feathery sepals that droop downward. Its leaves are compound, with multiple small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. Thalictrum nutans thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks."
