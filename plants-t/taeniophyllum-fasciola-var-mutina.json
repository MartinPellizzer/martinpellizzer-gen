    "intro": "Taeniophyllum fasciola var. mutina, commonly known as the miniature fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, compact fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
