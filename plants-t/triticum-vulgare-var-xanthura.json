    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. xanthura, commonly known as the yellow wheatgrass, is a variant of wheat characterized by its distinct yellow-green foliage. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate climates and is often found in open fields or along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow florets. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage crop. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from common wheat varieties due to its coloration and growth habits."
