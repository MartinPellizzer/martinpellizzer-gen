    "intro": "Tetrarrhena oreophila var. oreophila, commonly known as the mountain reed, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often found in montane grasslands and rocky outcrops."
