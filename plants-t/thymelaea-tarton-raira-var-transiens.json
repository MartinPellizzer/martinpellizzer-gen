    "intro": "Thymelaea tarton-raira var. transiens, commonly known as the Transient Thymelaea, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant exhibits a unique flowering pattern, with blooms appearing in response to seasonal changes rather than a fixed annual cycle. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to conserve water in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
