    "intro": "Taraxacum pribilofense, commonly known as the Pribilof dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea and is adapted to the harsh, cold climate of its arctic environment. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It has a rosette of basal leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, providing protection against the cold. Taraxacum pribilofense is a hardy perennial that thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal tundra habitats."
