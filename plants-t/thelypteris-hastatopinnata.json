    "intro": "Thelypteris hastatopinnata, commonly known as the broad-leaved holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are often adorned with toothed margins. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with short, broad pinnae that give the plant a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its ability to spread and establish in suitable habitats."
