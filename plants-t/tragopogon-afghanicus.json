    "intro": "Tragopogon afghanicus, commonly known as Afghan salsify, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia, particularly Afghanistan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in the summer, producing small, elongated seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Tragopogon afghanicus is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to arid environments."
