    "intro": "Tillandsia gigantea, commonly known as the giant air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can reach up to two meters in height. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia gigantea is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
