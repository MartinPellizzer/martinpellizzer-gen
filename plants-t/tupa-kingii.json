    "intro": "Tupa kingii, commonly known as the King's tupa, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests where it thrives on nutrient-rich, well-drained soils. Its botanical features include lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Tupa kingii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
