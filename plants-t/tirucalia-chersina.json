    "intro": "Tirucalia chersina, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange-red fruits that contain three seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in carpentry and furniture making. However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
