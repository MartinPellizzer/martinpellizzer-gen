It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, tripartite flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded, moist forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
