    "intro": "Tillandsia aeranthos var. rosea, commonly known as the pink air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking pink or red inflorescences that bloom in the summer, adding a vibrant touch to its appearance. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
