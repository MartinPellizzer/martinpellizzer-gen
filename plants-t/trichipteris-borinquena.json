    "intro": "Trichipteris borinquena, commonly known as the Puerto Rican fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Trichipteris borinquena is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
