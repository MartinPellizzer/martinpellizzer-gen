    "intro": "Taraxacum gyratum, commonly known as the spiral dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of bracts around the flower head, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are deeply lobed and form a basal rosette, while the stem is hollow and ribbed. The flower head produces a cluster of small, yellow florets that develop into the familiar white, fluffy seeds with parachute-like structures."
