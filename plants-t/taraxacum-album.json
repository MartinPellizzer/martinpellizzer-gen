    "intro": "Taraxacum album, commonly known as the dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a bright yellow flower head. The plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. It produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism with a fluffy, wind-catching parachute. The dandelion is known for its medicinal properties and is often used in herbal remedies."
