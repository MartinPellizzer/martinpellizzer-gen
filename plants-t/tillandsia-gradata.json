    "intro": "Tillandsia gradata, commonly known as the gradient air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees in humid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
