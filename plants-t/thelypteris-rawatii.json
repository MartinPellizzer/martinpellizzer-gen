    "intro": "Thelypteris rawatii, commonly known as the Rawat's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its leathery, lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, smooth texture with a waxy surface. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family."
