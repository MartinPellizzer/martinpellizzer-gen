    "intro": "Tetrapterys alternifolia, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its exudative leaves that secrete a white, sticky substance, which helps in deterring herbivores and trapping sediments. The plant thrives in saline and tidal environments, playing a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and preventing erosion. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The fruit is a capsule that releases buoyant seeds, aiding in its dispersal along coastal waters."
