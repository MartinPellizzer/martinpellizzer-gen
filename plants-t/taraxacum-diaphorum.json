    "intro": "Taraxacum diaphorum, commonly known as the ghost dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, pale yellow flowers and a basal rosette of finely divided, hairless leaves. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Its scientific name reflects its translucent or ghostly appearance, particularly in its flower structure. Taraxacum diaphorum is relatively rare and has limited distribution, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
