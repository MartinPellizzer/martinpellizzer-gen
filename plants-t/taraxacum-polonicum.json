    "intro": "Taraxacum polonicum, commonly known as the Polish dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Central and Eastern Europe, including Poland, where it gets its common name. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a bright yellow flower head. It produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous pappus-equipped seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. This species is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil health."
