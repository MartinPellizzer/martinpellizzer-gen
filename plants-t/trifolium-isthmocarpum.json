    "intro": "Trifolium isthmocarpum, commonly known as the Isthmus clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or red in color, arranged in clusters. Native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Trifolium isthmocarpum is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation."
