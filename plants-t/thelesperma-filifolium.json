    "intro": "Thelesperma filifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are slender and linear, giving it a distinctive appearance, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions. Thelesperma filifolium is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its native habitat."
