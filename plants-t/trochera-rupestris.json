    "intro": "Trochera rupestris, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky habitats in southern Africa. It features a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and green. The plant is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils, often in full sun. Its flowering period typically occurs during the late summer to early autumn months. Trochera rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
