    "intro": "Taxus montana, commonly known as the western yew, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, scale-like leaves that remain on the tree year-round. The plant produces small, red, berry-like structures called arils, which contain the seeds enclosed in a fleshy coating. Taxus montana is notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living over 200 years. It contains toxic compounds, such as taxine, which can be harmful to humans and animals."
