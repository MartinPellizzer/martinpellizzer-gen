    "intro": "Telipogon caroliae, commonly known as the Carolian grass. It is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Ecuador and Peru. This species belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telipogon caroliae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
