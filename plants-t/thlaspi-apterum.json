It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Thlaspi apterum is known for its ability to tolerate harsh climatic conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
