    "intro": "Terminalia tomentosa, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which give it its common name. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds. Terminalia tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appearance and has traditional uses in local medicine and as a source of timber."
