    "intro": "Tragopogon dubius, commonly known as the common goatsbeard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flower heads that resemble a fuzzy crown, followed by a tuft of bristly leaves. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which can be used in traditional medicine. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows. Tragopogon dubius is also known for its ability to hybridize with other species in the same genus, leading to the creation of new varieties."
