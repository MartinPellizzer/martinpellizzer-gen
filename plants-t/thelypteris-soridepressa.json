    "intro": "Thelypteris soridepressa, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, triangular-shaped fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the ground. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to their ornamental value."
