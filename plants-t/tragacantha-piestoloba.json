    "intro": "Tragacantha piestoloba, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a resinous sap, which can be tapped and used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Tragacantha piestoloba thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
