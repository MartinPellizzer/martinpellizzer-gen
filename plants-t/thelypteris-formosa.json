    "intro": "Thelypteris formosa, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure. The fronds are typically dark green with a glossy appearance and can reach lengths of up to 30 inches. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
