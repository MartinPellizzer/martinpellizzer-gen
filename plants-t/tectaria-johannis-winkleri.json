    "intro": "Tectaria johannis-winkleri, commonly known as the Winkler's tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive structure that includes a central rachis and multiple pinnae. The plant is native to tropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are released from sori that are arranged in lines along the margins of the pinnae. Tectaria johannis-winkleri is often found in forest understories, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
