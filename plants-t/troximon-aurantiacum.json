    "intro": "Troximon aurantiacum, commonly known as the orange-tailed orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking orange-red inflorescence, which consists of small, delicate flowers clustered along a slender, hairy stem. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique floral structure and coloration make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
