    "intro": "Tessmannianthus cereifolius, commonly known as the candlewood tree, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, waxy leaves that give it its scientific name, \"cereifolius,\" meaning \"wax-bearing.\" The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and smooth texture, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and construction. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
