    "intro": "Thelypteris gymnocarpa subsp. gymnocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-fruit water fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are often covered with a smooth, glabrous surface. Its rhizomes are creeping and often form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats."
