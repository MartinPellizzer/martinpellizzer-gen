    "intro": "Triodia claytonii, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth and needle-like leaves that form compact tussocks. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small animals. Triodia claytonii is also valued for its resilience and is often used in landscaping for erosion control."
