    "intro": "Taraxacum dilucidum, commonly known as the glassweed, is a rare and elusive species of dandelion native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that give it a unique, almost glass-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by white, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered in many areas. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to extreme environmental conditions and its role in alpine ecosystems."
