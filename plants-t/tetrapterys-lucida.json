    "intro": "Tetrapterys lucida, commonly known as the glittering mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and relies on host trees for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, opposite, elliptical leaves and produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are often overlooked. Its berries are red and contain a single seed, which is dispersed by birds. Tetrapterys lucida is notable for its dense, velvety foliage that gives it a shimmering appearance in sunlight."
