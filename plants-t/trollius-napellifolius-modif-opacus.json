    "intro": "Trollius napellifolius modif. opacus, commonly known as the obscure meadow buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features bright yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and its stems are usually short and hairy. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
