It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with simple, opposite leaves that are often pubescent. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated. Tetramicra simplex is valued in traditional medicine for its potential pharmacological properties."
