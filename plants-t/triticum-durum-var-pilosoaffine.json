    "intro": "Triticum durum var. pilosoaffine, commonly known as the rough durum wheat, is a variant of durum wheat characterized by its distinctive hairy or pubescent glumes and lemma. It is primarily cultivated for its high gluten content, which makes it ideal for producing semolina used in pasta and bread. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, with narrow, blade-like leaves and spikelets that bear the hard, amber-colored grains. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and requires a cool growing season for optimal development. Its botanical features make it an important crop in regions with traditional pasta-making industries."
