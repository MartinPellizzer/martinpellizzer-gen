    "intro": "Triticum lolioides var. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated spikelets and tall, tufted inflorescences that often grow in dense clusters. The plant typically thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
