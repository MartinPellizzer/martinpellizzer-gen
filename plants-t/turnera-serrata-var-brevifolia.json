    "intro": "Turnera serrata var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved turnera, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments within the understorey of forests. The plant features small, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and horticultural use. The variety brevifolia is distinguished by its shorter, more compact leaves compared to the typical form of Turnera serrata."
