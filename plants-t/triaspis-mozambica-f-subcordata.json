    "intro": "Triaspis mozambica f. subcordata, commonly known as the Mozambique triaspis, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, rosette-shaped growth pattern with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish or purple hue. The leaves are often adorned with a waxy coating, which helps the plant retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its low maintenance and striking appearance."
