    "intro": "Thelypteris pubescens, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups. Thelypteris pubescens is native to parts of Asia and is often found in temperate to subtropical regions."
