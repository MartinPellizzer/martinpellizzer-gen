It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a reddish-brown underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.
