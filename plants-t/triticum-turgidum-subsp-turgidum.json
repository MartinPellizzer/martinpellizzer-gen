    "intro": "Triticum turgidum subsp. turgidum, commonly known as durum wheat, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the production of hard, amber-colored grains. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has narrow, parallel-veined leaves. Its flowers are spike-like, with small, two-lobed glumes enclosing the florets. This subspecies is primarily cultivated for its high-protein grains, which are used in the production of pasta and bread."
