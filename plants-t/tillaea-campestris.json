It features small, fleshy, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a compact rosette of thick, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Tillaea campestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in gardens."
