    "intro": "Tragacantha sinica, commonly known as Chinese tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to China. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing small, dark seeds. Its roots are rich in a gel-like substance called tragacanth, which has been used in traditional medicine and as a thickening agent. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
