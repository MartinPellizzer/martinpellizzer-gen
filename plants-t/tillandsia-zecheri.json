    "intro": "Tillandsia zecheri, commonly known as the Zecheri air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It thrives by attaching itself to trees and other surfaces without parasitizing them, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb water and sunlight. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers, often followed by small, showy bracts. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
