    "intro": "Taraxacum subxanthostigma, commonly known as the yellow-centered dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flower head, which is surrounded by a pappus of bristles that aid in wind dispersal of its seeds. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are basal, alternate, and have a distinctive serrated margin. The species is closely related to other dandelion species but is distinguished by its unique yellow coloration and specific geographic distribution."
