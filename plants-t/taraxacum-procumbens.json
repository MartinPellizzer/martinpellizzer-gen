    "intro": "Taraxacum procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that lie close to the ground. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. Its root system is fibrous and often forms a dense mat, aiding in soil stabilization. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges."
