    "intro": "Tragacantha trichocarpa, commonly known as the Persian gum or Astragalus trichocarpus, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect stem and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive, spiny pods. It is valued for its resinous sap, which has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a food additive. Its ecological role includes nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil and supports other plant life."
