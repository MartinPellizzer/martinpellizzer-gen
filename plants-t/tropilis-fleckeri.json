    "intro": "Tropilis fleckeri, commonly known as the Flecker's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky slopes or in cloud forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin soil layers typical of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tropilis fleckeri is considered a vulnerable species."
