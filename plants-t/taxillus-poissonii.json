    "intro": "Taxillus poissonii, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using sunlight. The plant forms a dense, tangled mass on the host, often leading to reduced growth or even death of the host tree. Its small, white or pink flowers appear in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Taxillus poissonii is native to regions of India and Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates."
