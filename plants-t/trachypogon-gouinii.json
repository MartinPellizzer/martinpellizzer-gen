    "intro": "Trachypogon gouinii, commonly known as the Gouin's hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its common name. Trachypogon gouinii is often found in grassland habitats and is adapted to dry, well-drained soils."
