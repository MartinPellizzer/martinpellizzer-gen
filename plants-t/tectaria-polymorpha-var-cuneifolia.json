    "intro": "Tectaria polymorpha var. cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tectaria, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds and reproductive structures. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce both sterile and fertile fronds. Its leaves are usually lanceolate or narrow-elliptical in shape, and the sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. This variety is noted for its adaptability to moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in forest understories."
