    "intro": "Tarenna pubiflora, commonly known as the hairy-flowered tarenna, is a small evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds. Tarenna pubiflora is typically found in moist, shaded forest habitats and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
