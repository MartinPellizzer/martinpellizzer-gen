    "intro": "Tephroseris integrifolia subsp. kirilowii, commonly known as the Kirilow's leafy tephroseris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a compact inflorescence, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
