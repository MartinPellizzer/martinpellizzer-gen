    "intro": "Thymus zygiformis subsp. albanus, commonly known as Albanian thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and small, aromatic leaves that are densely packed on the stems. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in terminal clusters, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
