    "intro": "Trasus filiformis var. simplex, commonly known as the slender leaf fern, is a delicate, low-growing fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features long, slender fronds that are typically less than a meter in length, with a soft, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, with spores produced on the underside of the fronds. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
