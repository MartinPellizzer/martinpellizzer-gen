    "intro": "Tupeia, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Tupeia species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with their deep root systems. Some species are used in traditional medicine, though their botanical significance lies mainly in their ecological role within their native habitats."
