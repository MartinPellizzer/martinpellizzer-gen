    "intro": "Tridentea rugosa, commonly known as the rough trident, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, triangular leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Tridentea rugosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
