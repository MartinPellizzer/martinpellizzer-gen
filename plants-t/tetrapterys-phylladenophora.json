    "intro": "Tetrapterys phylladenophora, commonly known as the broadleaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by flat, leathery pods that contain the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warmer climates."
