    "intro": "Tectaria incisa f. incisa, commonly known as the split-leaf tectaria, is a fern species belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, which helps anchor it to substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
