    "intro": "Taxus cuspidata var. caespitosa, commonly known as the Japanese yew or Japanese red yew, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to Japan. It features dense, dark green foliage with a compact, rounded form that makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant. The leaves are narrow, leathery, and have a slightly serrated edge, while the plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers well-drained, acidic soil, making it a popular choice for shaded landscapes. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resistance to pests and diseases."
