    "intro": "Torrubia floridana, commonly known as the Florida torrubia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
