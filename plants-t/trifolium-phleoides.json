    "intro": "Trifolium phleoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Trifolium phleoides is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for agricultural and ecological purposes."
