    "intro": "Thelypteris microloncha, commonly known as the small-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. Its sori, which are clusters of sporangia, are arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds. Thelypteris microloncha is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
