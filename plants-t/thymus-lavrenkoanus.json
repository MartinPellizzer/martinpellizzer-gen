    "intro": "Thymus lavrenkoanus, commonly known as the Lavrenko's thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage of small, aromatic leaves. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained, rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
