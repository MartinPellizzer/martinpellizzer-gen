    "intro": "Thelypteris seidleri, commonly known as the Seidler's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered spores on the underside of its fronds, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Thelypteris seidleri thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
