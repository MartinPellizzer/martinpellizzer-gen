    "intro": "Trigonochilum wetzelii, commonly known as the Wetzel's spike moss, is a member of the family Lepidoziaceae and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, terrestrial liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant has a distinctive morphology, featuring a creeping stem with small, scale-like leaves arranged in a spiral pattern. Its reproductive structures, called sporophytes, are elongated and produce spores for dispersal. Trigonochilum wetzelii plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystem."
