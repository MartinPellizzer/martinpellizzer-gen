    "intro": "Thymus loscosii, commonly known as the Corsican thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica. It is characterized by its low-growing, compact form and small, aromatic leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Thymus loscosii thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its essential oils contain compounds like thymol and carvacrol, which contribute to its medicinal and aromatic properties."
