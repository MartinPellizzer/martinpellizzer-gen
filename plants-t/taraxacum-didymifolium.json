    "intro": "Taraxacum didymifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to Europe and western Asia, and it thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows and disturbed soils. It produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. This species is often considered a weed but also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
