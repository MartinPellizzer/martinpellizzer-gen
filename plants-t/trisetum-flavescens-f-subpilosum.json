    "intro": "Trisetum flavescens f. subpilosum, commonly known as the silky bluegrass, is a grass species characterized by its fine, soft foliage. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. The plant has slender stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, blue-green flowers. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving it a silky texture, which is a distinguishing feature of the subspecies. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
