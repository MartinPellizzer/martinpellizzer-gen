    "intro": "Toxicodendron radicans subsp. radicans, commonly known as poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a cluster, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a toxic resin called urushiol, which causes severe skin irritation in many individuals. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests, fields, and along roadsides. Due to its widespread distribution and allergenic properties, it is a common plant that requires caution when handling."
