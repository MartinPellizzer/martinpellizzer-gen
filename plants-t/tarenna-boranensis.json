    "intro": "Tarenna boranensis, commonly known as the African starfruit or African yellow wood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright yellow-orange berries. Its fruits are edible, though they are not as widely consumed as the common starfruit (Carambola). Tarenna boranensis is often found in moist, shaded areas of forests and is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties."
