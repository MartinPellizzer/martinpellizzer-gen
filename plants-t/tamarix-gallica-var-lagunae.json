    "intro": "Tamarix gallica var. lagunae, commonly known as the saltbush or Mediterranean tamarisk, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid and saline environments. The plant produces pink or red flowers in summer, which are borne in dense clusters. It has a deep root system that helps it access groundwater, contributing to its resilience in dry conditions. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soils in coastal or saline areas."
