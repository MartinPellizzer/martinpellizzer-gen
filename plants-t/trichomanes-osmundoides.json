    "intro": "Trichomanes osmundoides, commonly known as the water fern, is a member of the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds. It is a tropical plant that typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as swamps and marshes. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a central axis that produces both roots and sporangia. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, closely arranged pinnae that give it a dense, feathery appearance. Trichomanes osmundoides is notable for its primitive features and is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage."
