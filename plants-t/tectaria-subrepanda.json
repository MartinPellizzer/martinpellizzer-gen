    "intro": "Tectaria subrepanda, commonly known as the broad-leafed tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests and montane regions, where it thrives in high humidity. Its rhizomes are usually short and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns."
