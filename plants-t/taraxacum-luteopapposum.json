    "intro": "Taraxacum luteopapposum, commonly known as the yellow pappus dandelion, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy white seed heads. The plant is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, where it thrives in meadows and grassy areas. It has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and slightly lobed. The species is notable for its ability to produce a large number of lightweight seeds, which are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across various habitats."
