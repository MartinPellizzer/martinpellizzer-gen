    "intro": "Tanacetum sanguineum f. filiformum, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a flowering plant characterized by its distinctive red-tinged flowers and compact growth habit. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its ornamental value and hardiness. The f. filiformum form is notable for its filiform (thread-like) leaves, which distinguish it from other varieties of Tanacetum sanguineum."
