It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine and as a forage crop."
