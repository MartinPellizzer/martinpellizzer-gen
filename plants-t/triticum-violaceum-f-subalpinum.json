    "intro": "Triticum violaceum f. subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine blue wheat, is a botanical variant of the wild wheat species Triticum violaceum. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue florets, which distinguish it from other wheat varieties. This subspecies is typically found in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cooler, moist conditions. Its growth habit is low and compact, with slender stalks and small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its unique coloration and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists studying alpine flora."
