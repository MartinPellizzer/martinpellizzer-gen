    "intro": "Trichocentrum schwambachiae, commonly known as the Schwambach's orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, racemose inflorescence and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, yellow, and orange. The plant has elongated, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, adapting it to its often-dry and shaded habitats. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Trichocentrum schwambachiae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
