    "intro": "Taraxacum conspersum, commonly known as the hairy dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, alternate leaves that are often covered with fine pubescence. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed head known as a pappus. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Taraxacum conspersum is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other sunny areas where it can spread readily through its wind-dispersed seeds."
