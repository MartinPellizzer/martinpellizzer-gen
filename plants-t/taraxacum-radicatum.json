    "intro": "Taraxacum radicatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, inconspicuous flower head. The flower head produces a cluster of small, yellow disk flowers that mature into a spherical, seed-filled puffball. It is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
