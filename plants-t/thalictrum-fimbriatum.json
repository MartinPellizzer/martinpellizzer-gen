    "intro": "Thalictrum fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed meadow-rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that often grow in clusters, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy, feathery flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided, fern-like lobes that give it a delicate appearance. Thalictrum fimbriatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and streamside habitats."
