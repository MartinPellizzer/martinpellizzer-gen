    "intro": "Trillium grandiflorum f. viride, commonly known as the green-flowered white trillium, is a unique variant of the white trillium native to eastern North America. It is distinguished by its striking greenish-white petals, which set it apart from the typical white petals of the species. The plant features three broad, waxy leaves and a single, three-lobed flower that blooms in early spring. It thrives in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in rich, loamy soils. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable component of forest ecosystems."
