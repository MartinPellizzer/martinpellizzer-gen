    "intro": "Triticum spelta var. griseoturanorecens, commonly known as grey-husked spelt, is a lesser-known variant of spelt wheat characterized by its distinctive greyish husk. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is native to temperate regions of Europe. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Its grains are smaller and more compact compared to common wheat, and it is often used in traditional or artisanal baking. This variety is valued for its nutritional profile and is gaining interest in organic and heritage crop cultivation."
