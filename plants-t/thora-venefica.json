    "intro": "Thora venefica, commonly known as the poison thorn, is a strikingly toxic plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features spiny, woody stems that can grow up to three meters in height, with small, dark green leaves arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its sap contains potent alkaloids, making it highly dangerous to touch or ingest. Despite its toxicity, it plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing shelter for small animals and contributing to soil stabilization."
