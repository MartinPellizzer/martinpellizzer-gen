    "intro": "Tococa formicaria, commonly known as the ant plant, is a climbing shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its unique hollow stems that provide shelter for colonies of ants. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with these ants, which defend it from herbivores in exchange for shelter and food. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a leathery texture. Tococa formicaria is also noted for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its role in the complex ecological interactions of the rainforest."
