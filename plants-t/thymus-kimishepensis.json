    "intro": "Thymus kimishepensis, commonly known as the Ethiopian thyme, is a small, aromatic shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It features compact, evergreen foliage with dense, grey-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
