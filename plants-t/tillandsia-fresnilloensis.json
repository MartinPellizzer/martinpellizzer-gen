    "intro": "Tillandsia fresnilloensis, commonly known as the Fresnillo air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, compact rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
