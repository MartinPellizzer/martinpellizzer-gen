    "intro": "Thymus indicus, commonly known as Indian thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, aromatic, gray-green leaves and clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers. The plant produces essential oils rich in thymol and carvacrol, which contribute to its strong medicinal and culinary uses. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Thymus indicus is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
