    "intro": "Tribolium, commonly known as the grain weevil, is a genus of beetles belonging to the family Curculionidae. These small insects are characterized by their elongated, cylindrical bodies and hardened exoskeletons. They are primarily found in stored grain products, where they feed on seeds and grains, causing significant damage to agricultural crops. Tribolium species are often pests in grain storage facilities and are known for their ability to infest a wide range of cereal grains. Their life cycle includes egg, larval, pupal, and adult stages, with the larvae being the primary damaging stage."
