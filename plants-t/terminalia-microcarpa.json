    "intro": "Terminalia microcarpa, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its fine grain and durability, making it important in local economies. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
