    "intro": "Trifolium hervieri, commonly known as Hervier's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. This plant is native to parts of North America, particularly the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Trifolium hervieri is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for pollinators."
