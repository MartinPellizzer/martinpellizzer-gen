    "intro": "Taraxacum simulum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the dandelion family (Compositae) and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces a hollow, leafless stem that bears the flower head, which develops into a crown of bracts after flowering. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a wavy margin and are covered in fine hairs. Taraxacum simulum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and as a food source for various insects."
