    "intro": "Thrasya petrosa var. ciliata, commonly known as the silky rock heath, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Its unique ciliate (fringed) margins on the leaves give it its botanical name. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and drought tolerance."
