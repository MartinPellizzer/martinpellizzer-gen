    "intro": "Teucrium sanguisorbifolium, commonly known as redroot germander, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant features gray-green, lance-shaped leaves with a fuzzy texture and produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its name reflects both its reddish roots and its resemblance to other members of the Germander genus."
