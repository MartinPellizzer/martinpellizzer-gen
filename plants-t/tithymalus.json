    "intro": "Tithymalus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed tithymalus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers that often display a range of colors from white to pink. They are typically found in temperate regions and thrive in well-drained soils. The flowers are usually pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Tithymalus species are often used in gardens for their ornamental value and can attract beneficial pollinators to the ecosystem."
