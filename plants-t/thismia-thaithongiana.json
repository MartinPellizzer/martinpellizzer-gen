    "intro": "Thismia thaithongiana, commonly known as the Thai ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thismiaceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungi for nutrients. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers with a distinctive, almost ghostly appearance. It is typically found in shaded, humid forests, often growing in association with specific fungal networks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
