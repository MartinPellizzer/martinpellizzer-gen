    "intro": "Theodorea koraiensis, commonly known as the Korean starflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Korea. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
