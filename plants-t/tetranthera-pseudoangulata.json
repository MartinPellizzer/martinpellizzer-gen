    "intro": "Tetranthera pseudoangulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tetranthera, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow and arranged in clusters, making it a common sight in disturbed soils and open habitats. Tetranthera pseudoangulata is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in supporting local pollinator populations."
