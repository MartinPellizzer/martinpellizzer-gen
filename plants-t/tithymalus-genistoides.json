    "intro": "Tithymalus genistoides, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters along the stems. The plant has slender, woody stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in fine hairs. Tithymalus genistoides thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
