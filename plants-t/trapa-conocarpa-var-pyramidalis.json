    "intro": "Trapa conocarpa var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramid water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, triangular fruits that resemble small pyramids, which are a key feature for identification. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes and slow-moving rivers, where it forms dense vegetation. Its leaves are floating and have a waxy surface, while its roots are submerged and help stabilize the sediment. The species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and ecological benefits in aquatic habitats."
