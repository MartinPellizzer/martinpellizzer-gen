    "intro": "Tillandsia fasciculata var. densispica, commonly known as the dense-spiked air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense clusters of long, narrow leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it collect and retain moisture. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of white or pale pink. This variety is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
