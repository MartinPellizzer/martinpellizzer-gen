    "intro": "Taraxacum dilutissimum, commonly known as the pale dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a slender, hollow stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, fluffy seed head that disperses seeds via the wind, a common adaptation in the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils and grasslands. The species is noted for its low-growing habit and is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental plant."
