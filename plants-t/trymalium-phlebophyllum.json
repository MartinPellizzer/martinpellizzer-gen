    "intro": "Trymalium phlebophyllum, commonly known as the red-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southeastern Australia. It grows on the branches of eucalyptus and other host trees, deriving some of its nutrients from the host while photosynthesizing independently. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that adhere to birds for dispersal. Due to its specialized growth habits and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
