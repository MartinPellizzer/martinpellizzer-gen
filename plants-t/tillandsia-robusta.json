    "intro": "Tillandsia robusta, commonly known as the hardy air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant has short, fibrous roots and possesses rosettes of narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes. These trichomes help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. It produces vibrant, bell-shaped inflorescences that range in color from white to pink, adding ornamental value to its natural habitat."
