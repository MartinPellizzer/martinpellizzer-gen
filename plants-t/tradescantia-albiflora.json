    "intro": "Tradescantia albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered spiderwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant green. The plant produces small, showy white or pale blue flowers with three petals, which bloom in the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread through rhizomes, creating dense ground cover."
