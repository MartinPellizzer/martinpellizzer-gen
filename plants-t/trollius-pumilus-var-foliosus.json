    "intro": "Trollius pumilus var. foliosus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra. Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
