    "intro": "Thymus disjunctus, commonly known as the Sierra Madre thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features aromatic, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, typical of the Thymus genus. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or arid environments. Its compact size and ornamental value make it a desirable plant for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
