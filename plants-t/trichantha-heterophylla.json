    "intro": "Trichantha heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf trichantha, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, which can range from ovate to linear, depending on environmental conditions. It produces small, clustered white flowers during the summer months, followed by distinctive triangular seed capsules. Trichantha heterophylla is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along rocky outcrops."
