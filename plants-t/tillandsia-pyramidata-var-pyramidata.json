    "intro": "Tillandsia pyramidata var. pyramidata, commonly known as the Pyramidal Tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a compact, pyramid-like structure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, violet or white flowers that bloom in the summer, adding ornamental value to the plant."
