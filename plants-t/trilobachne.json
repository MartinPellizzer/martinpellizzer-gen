    "intro": "Trilobachne, commonly known as the three-lobed grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves and compact growth habit. Trilobachne species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in wet or disturbed habitats. The plants produce small, spike-like inflorescences with minute flowers. They are of interest to botanists due to their unique morphology and ecological adaptability."
