    "intro": "Trichocereus serenanus, commonly known as the San Pedro cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, green stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow or white flowers during the warmer months, which are often followed by small, red fruits. Its leaves are typically spiny and shed as the plant matures. Trichocereus serenanus is known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of mescaline."
