    "intro": "Tecoma chrysantha subsp. meridionalis, commonly known as the golden trumpet bush, is a shrub native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its bright yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters along the branches. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
