It features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green, often with a bluish tinge. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
