    "intro": "Trollius schipczinskii, commonly known as the Schipczinsky's globeflower, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The plant is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that resemble globes, with numerous petals arranged in a dense, rounded cluster. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Trollius schipczinskii is typically found in rocky slopes and alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
