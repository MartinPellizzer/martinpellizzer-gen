    "intro": "Tectaria keckii, commonly known as the Keck's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows on trees or rocky surfaces. The plant features a rhizome that is covered with a thick, protective layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures. Its fronds are usually leathery and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance, giving it its common name. Tectaria keckii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests."
