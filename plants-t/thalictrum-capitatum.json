    "intro": "Thalictrum capitatum, commonly known as the showy avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal. Thalictrum capitatum is also noted for its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
