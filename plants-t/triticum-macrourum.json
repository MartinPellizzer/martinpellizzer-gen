    "intro": "Triticum macrourum, commonly known as the longawn wheat, is a wild species of wheat native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, typical of the grass family. Its seeds are generally smaller than those of cultivated wheat species. Triticum macrourum is of interest to botanists and geneticists due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to harsh environments."
