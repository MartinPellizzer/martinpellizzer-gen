    "intro": "Torreya grandis var. yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan torreya, is a rare evergreen conifer native to southwestern China. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited natural range and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
