    "intro": "Taraxacum tinctum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a bright yellow flower head. The plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. It produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism known as a pappus, which allows its seeds to be carried by the wind. Taraxacum tinctum is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
