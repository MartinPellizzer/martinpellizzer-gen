    "intro": "Trifolium minutiflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides. Trifolium minutiflorum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
