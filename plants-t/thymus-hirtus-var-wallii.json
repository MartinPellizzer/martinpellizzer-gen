    "intro": "Thymus hirtus var. wallii, commonly known as Wall's thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features aromatic, hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The essential oils extracted from its leaves are used in aromatherapy and traditional medicine for their antiseptic and calming properties."
