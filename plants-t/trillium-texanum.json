    "intro": "Trillium texanum, commonly known as the Texas trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features three elliptic-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces a single, showy white flower with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in early spring. Trillium texanum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
