    "intro": "Taraxacum divulsum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, elongated flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets. After flowering, the plant produces a distinctive seed head known as a \"puffball,\" which releases lightweight seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. This species is widespread and commonly found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed soils across temperate regions."
