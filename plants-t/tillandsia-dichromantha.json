    "intro": "Tillandsia dichromantha, commonly known as the two-color air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green with a striking red or purple stripe along the midrib. Tillandsia dichromantha thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
