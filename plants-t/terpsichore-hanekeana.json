    "intro": "Terpsichore hanekeana, commonly known as the silver-leaved fern, is a rare and endemic plant found in the subtropical regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, silver-gray foliage that reflects light, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is known for its intricate, lace-like fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically along stream banks and in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
