    "intro": "Tillandsia sinuosa var. quirozii, commonly known as the Quir\u00f3z's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant features rosettes of narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces inflorescences with showy, violet or pink flowers that bloom in the summer. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
