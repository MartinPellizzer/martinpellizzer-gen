It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a long, hollow stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its flowers produce a distinctive seed head with pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal. The species is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in herbal remedies."
