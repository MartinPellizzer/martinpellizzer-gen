    "intro": "Tectaria holttumii, commonly known as the Holttum's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a protective shield-like structure. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ability to retain moisture in its natural habitat."
