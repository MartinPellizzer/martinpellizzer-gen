    "intro": "Tectaria suluensis, commonly known as the Sulu shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its morphology and ecological role. Tectaria suluensis contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitat and is an example of the rich flora found in Southeast Asia."
