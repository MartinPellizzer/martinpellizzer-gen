    "intro": "Thalictrum bauhini subsp. tenuifolium, commonly known as slenderleaf meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and covered in a soft, silky texture. The plant produces showy, clustered white or pale yellow flowers in early to mid-summer, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a valuable addition to woodland gardens. Its unique foliage and subtle floral display make it an attractive and ecologically beneficial plant for native plant landscapes."
