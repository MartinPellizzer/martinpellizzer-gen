    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. hystrix, commonly known as the hystrix wheat, is a variant of common wheat characterized by its unique floral structure. This plant is notable for its bristle-like awns that extend from the glumes, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is typically found in disturbed soils and grasslands, thriving in temperate climates. The botanical features include a spikelet arrangement with two florets per spikelet, and it produces achenes as its fruiting bodies. Its morphology and growth habits make it an interesting subject for botanical study and agricultural research."
