    "intro": "Taraxacum quaesitum, commonly known as the sought-after dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, large, yellow flower head. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, often growing in disturbed soils and meadows. Its flowers develop into fluffy, white seed heads that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its widespread distribution. Taraxacum quaesitum is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies for various ailments."
