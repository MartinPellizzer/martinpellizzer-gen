    "intro": "Triplocentron sulphureum, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a sprawling habit, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a vibrant touch to its arid habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
