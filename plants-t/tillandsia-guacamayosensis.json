    "intro": "Tillandsia guacamayosensis, commonly known as the Guacamayos air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
