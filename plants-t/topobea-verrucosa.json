    "intro": "Topobea verrucosa, commonly known as the roughleaf tree, is a perennial shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rugged, thickly foliaged leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Its bark is typically gray to brown and becomes fissured with age. Topobea verrucosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to provide habitat for local wildlife."
