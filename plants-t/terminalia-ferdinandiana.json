    "intro": "Terminalia ferdinandiana, commonly known as the beefwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Kimberley region of northern Western Australia. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, edible pods containing flat, bean-like seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. The beefwood tree is also valued for its timber, which is hard and durable, and for its role in traditional Aboriginal culture."
