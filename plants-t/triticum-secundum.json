    "intro": "Triticum secundum, commonly known as the secondary wheat, is a lesser-known species within the wheat genus. It is a wild grass native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and produces small, beige or pale brown grains. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a fibrous root system, which help it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. While not widely cultivated, it has been studied for its potential in genetic research and as a source of drought-resistant traits."
