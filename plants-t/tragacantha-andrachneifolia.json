    "intro": "Tragacantha andrachneifolia, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range from white to pink. The plant produces a sticky, resinous sap known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system and waxy leaf surfaces."
