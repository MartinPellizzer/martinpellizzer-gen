    "intro": "Tylophora renchangii, commonly known as the Guangxi tylophora, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is native to China, specifically found in the Guangxi region, where it grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture. Its flowers are small, clustered, and typically white or greenish-white in color, while its fruit is a follicle containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
