    "intro": "Tillandsia terminalis, commonly known as the silver pine or air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular ornamental plant in indoor gardening."
