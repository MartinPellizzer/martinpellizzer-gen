    "intro": "Tetradium austrosinense, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal."
