    "intro": "Thelypteris tenebrica, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often have a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris tenebrica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
