    "intro": "Turbinicarpus saueri subsp. saueri, commonly known as the Sauer's turbinicarpus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to southern Africa. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed, spiny stem that typically grows to about 5\u201310 cm in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, erect stems. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
