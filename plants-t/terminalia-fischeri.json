    "intro": "Terminalia fischeri, commonly known as the Fischer's Terminalia, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits that contain a single seed. Terminalia fischeri is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in local crafts and construction. It also plays a role in traditional medicine and is often found in dry woodland and savanna habitats."
