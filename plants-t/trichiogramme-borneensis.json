    "intro": "Trichiogramme borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean trichiogramma, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Its leaves are finely divided and have a delicate, fern-like appearance, while its flowers are white or pale yellow. Trichiogramme borneensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
