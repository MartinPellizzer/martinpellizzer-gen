    "intro": "Tuberolabium elobe, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking yellow petals and sepals, which often contrast with its greenish-brown labellum. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Tuberolabium elobe typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories. Its tuberous roots are an important feature, helping it store nutrients and survive periods of drought."
