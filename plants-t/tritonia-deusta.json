    "intro": "Tritonia deusta, commonly known as the red spider lily, is a striking plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Amaryllis family (Amaryllidaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant red, spider-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features strap-shaped, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous underground stem. Tritonia deusta prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to naturalize and thrive in mild climates."
