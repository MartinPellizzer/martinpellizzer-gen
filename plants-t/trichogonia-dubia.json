    "intro": "Trichogonia dubia, commonly known as the rare ghost orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Trichogonia dubia is considered an endangered species."
