    "intro": "Trichoglottis acutifolia, commonly known as the acute-leaved orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates. Trichoglottis acutifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in tropical and subtropical climates."
