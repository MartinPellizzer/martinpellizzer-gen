    "intro": "Trifolium clusii var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
