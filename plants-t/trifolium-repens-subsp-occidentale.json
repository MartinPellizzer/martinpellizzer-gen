    "intro": "Trifolium repens subsp. occidentale, commonly known as western white clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. This subspecies is valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage crop for livestock."
