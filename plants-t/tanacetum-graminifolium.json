    "intro": "Tanacetum graminifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are usually gray-green in color, with a strong, camphor-like scent. It produces yellow flower heads composed of numerous small florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tanacetum graminifolium is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
