    "intro": "Taraxacum lepidum, commonly known as the hairy dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a spherical seed ball. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in a variety of soil types, including disturbed and cultivated areas. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in harsh conditions and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. The hairy dandelion is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used for its diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects."
