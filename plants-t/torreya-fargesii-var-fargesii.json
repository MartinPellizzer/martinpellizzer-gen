    "intro": "Torreya fargesii var. fargesii, commonly known as the Chinese torreya, is a rare evergreen conifer native to China. It is characterized by its long, narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in spirals around the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by oval, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its limited natural range and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
