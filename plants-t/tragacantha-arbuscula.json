    "intro": "Tragacantha arbuscula, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and hairy, oval-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with low moisture availability. Tragacantha arbuscula plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small animals and insects."
