It is characterized by its striking, spiny leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue or purple. Tilingia species are native to coastal regions of southern Europe and the Mediterranean, where they thrive in salty, well-drained soils. The plant is often found growing in rocky or sandy habitats, and it is adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a notable subject in botanical studies."
