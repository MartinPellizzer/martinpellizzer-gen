    "intro": "Tillandsia usneoides f. genuina, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic bromeliad that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It lacks roots and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its specialized leaf surfaces. The plant is characterized by its long, hanging filaments that form dense, green cascades on trees. It is native to the southeastern United States and parts of South America. Despite its appearance, it is not parasitic and does not harm its host tree."
