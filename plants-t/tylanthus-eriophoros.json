    "intro": "Tylanthus eriophoros, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tamarack, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands. The tree is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in its native habitats."
