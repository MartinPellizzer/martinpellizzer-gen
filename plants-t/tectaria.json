    "intro": "Tectaria, commonly known as the shield fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Tectariaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments. Tectaria species are predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Their rhizomes are often thick and fleshy, contributing to their ability to store water and nutrients. The genus includes over 200 species, many of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants."
