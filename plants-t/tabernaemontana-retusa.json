    "intro": "Tabernaemontana retusa, commonly known as the white angel's trumpets, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a strong, sweet fragrance. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil and partial to full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant, though it contains toxic alkaloids that require careful handling."
