    "intro": "Tillandsia fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding ornamental value. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is popular as a houseplant and in botanical collections."
