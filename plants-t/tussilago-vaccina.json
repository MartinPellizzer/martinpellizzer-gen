    "intro": "Tussilago vaccina, commonly known as the common coltsfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, silver-green basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found near streams, ditches, and woodland edges. Its flowers are tubular and typically bloom in early spring before the leaves fully expand. Tussilago vaccina is known for its medicinal properties, historically used to treat respiratory ailments."
