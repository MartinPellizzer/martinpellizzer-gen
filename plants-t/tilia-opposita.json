    "intro": "Tilia opposita, commonly known as the opposite-leaf lime or small-leaved lime, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely on the stems, giving it its scientific name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. Tilia opposita typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and prefers well-drained, fertile soils. It is often found in woodland edges and is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
