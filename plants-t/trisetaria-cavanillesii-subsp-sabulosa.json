    "intro": "Trisetaria cavanillesii subsp. sabulosa, commonly known as the sandy trisetaria, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It is often found in coastal dunes and other sandy habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
