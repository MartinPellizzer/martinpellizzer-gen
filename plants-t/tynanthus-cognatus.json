    "intro": "Tynanthus cognatus, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including humans, if ingested. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its flowers are typically about 1 inch in diameter. Tynanthus cognatus plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
