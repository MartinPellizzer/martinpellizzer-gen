    "intro": "Tillandsia guenther-nolleri, commonly known as the Guenther-Nolleri air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
