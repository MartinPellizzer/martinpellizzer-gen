    "intro": "Tillandsia elata, commonly known as the Crimson Vanda, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its long, pendant stems and clusters of showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation. Tillandsia elata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity."
