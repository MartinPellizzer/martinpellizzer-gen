    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 simplex, commonly known as the small-leaf linden, is a hybrid deciduous tree that belongs to the Tiliaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are smaller than those of its parent species, Tilia cordata and Tilia europaea. The tree produces fragrant, white, clustered flowers in early summer, which are an important food source for pollinators. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Tilia \u00d7 simplex is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is found in temperate regions across Europe and Asia."
