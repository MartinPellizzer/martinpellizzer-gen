    "intro": "Taxus canadensis var. stricta, commonly known as the Canadian yew or stiff yew, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, scale-like leaves arranged in flat, spreading clusters. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various bird species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is widely cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
