    "intro": "Tillandsia paraibica, commonly known as the Paraiba air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
