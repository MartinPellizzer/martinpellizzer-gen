    "intro": "Toxosiphon carinatus, commonly known as the warty bladderwrack, is a species of brown algae belonging to the family Fucaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, warty thallus that is often covered in small, protruding structures. This marine plant typically grows in intertidal zones, attaching itself to rocks or other substrates in shallow coastal waters. Its structure consists of a holdfast, a stipe, and blade-like fronds, which are rich in algal compounds. Toxosiphon carinatus plays a role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
