    "intro": "Thelypteris thelypterioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature common in many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Thelypteris thelypterioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
