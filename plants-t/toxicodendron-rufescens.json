    "intro": "Toxicodendron rufescens, commonly known as the red-leaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are composed of multiple narrow, reddish-green leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a key feature of its appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. However, it contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation in humans."
