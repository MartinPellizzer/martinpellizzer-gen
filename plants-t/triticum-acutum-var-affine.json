It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets. It is valued for its potential in forage and as a source of genetic diversity for wheat improvement. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological and agricultural studies."
