    "intro": "Torreya taxifolia argentea, commonly known as the silver-tipped torreya, is a rare evergreen conifer native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its long, slender leaves that are often covered in a silvery or whitish bloom, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by cone-like structures containing edible seeds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested environments. Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
