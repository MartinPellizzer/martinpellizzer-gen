It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking orange to red flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The tree has a straight trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and produces long, narrow leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its flowers are tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds, contributing to its ecological significance. The wood of Tabebuia fuscata is hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and furniture-making."
