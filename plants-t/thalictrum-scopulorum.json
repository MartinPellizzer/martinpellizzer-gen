    "intro": "Thalictrum scopulorum, commonly known as the rock meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early to mid-summer. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided leaflets that give it a lacy appearance. Thalictrum scopulorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators in its native environment."
