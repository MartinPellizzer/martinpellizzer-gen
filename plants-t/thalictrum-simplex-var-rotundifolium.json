It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are rounded at the base, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and prefers partial to full shade. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
