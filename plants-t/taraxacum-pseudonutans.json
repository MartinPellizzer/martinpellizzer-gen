    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudonutans, commonly known as the Canadian dandelion, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant features a basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves that are typically light to dark green in color. It produces a slender stem that bears a bright yellow flower head, which develops into a spherical seed ball with parachute-like seeds for wind dispersal. Taraxacum pseudonutans is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in many regions."
