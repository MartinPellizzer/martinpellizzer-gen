    "intro": "Trichomanes hirtellum, commonly known as the hairy rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern found in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome with clustered, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, short hairs. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in small, clustered sporangia. Trichomanes hirtellum is typically found on rock surfaces or in crevices, where it thrives in humid, cool conditions."
