    "intro": "Trichocentrum cepula, commonly known as the purple-tinged orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender stems and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and purple. Its leaves are typically elongated and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Trichocentrum cepula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
