    "intro": "Tapinanthus pentagonia, commonly known as the five-angled dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are typically dispersed by wind or animals. The plant has a highly branched, thread-like stem that can\u7f20\u7ed5 (wrap around) its host, often forming a dense network. It is native to regions in Africa and is commonly found in grasslands and disturbed habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host plants if left unchecked."
