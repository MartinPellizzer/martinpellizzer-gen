    "intro": "Thymus graveolens, commonly known as winter thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features dense, compact foliage with small, aromatic leaves that emit a strong, pungent scent. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in late winter to early spring, which attract pollinators like bees. Its leaves are widely used in culinary applications and traditional medicine for their antiseptic and aromatic properties. Thymus graveolens thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and borders."
