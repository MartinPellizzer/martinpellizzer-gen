    "intro": "Tectaria quinquefida, commonly known as the five-lobed shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into five lobes, giving it a shield-like appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns."
