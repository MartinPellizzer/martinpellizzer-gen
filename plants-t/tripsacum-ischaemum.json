    "intro": "Tripsacum ischaemum, commonly known as wild maize or teosinte, is a wild grass native to South America. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is closely related to modern maize (Zea mays). The plant has narrow, sword-shaped leaves and produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers. Its genetic diversity has been important in the domestication of maize. Tripsacum ischaemum is also valued for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
