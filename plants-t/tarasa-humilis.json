    "intro": "Tarasa humilis, commonly known as the dwarf tarasa, is a low-growing perennial herb native to specific regions of Central Asia. It typically reaches a height of no more than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
