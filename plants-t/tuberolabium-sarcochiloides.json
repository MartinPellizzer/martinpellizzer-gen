    "intro": "Tuberolabium sarcochiloides, commonly known as the wrinkled orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique tuberous roots and intricate, often fragrant flowers with a distinctive labellum shape. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its harsh environment, including compact growth and seasonal flowering. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation terms."
