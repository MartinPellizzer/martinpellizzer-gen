    "intro": "Tripodion tetraphyllum, commonly known as the four-leafed tripodion, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 1 meter and features compact, dense foliage with small, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
