    "intro": "Trichera trivialis, commonly known as the three-lobed lily, is a herbaceous plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The leaves are lanceolate, with three distinct lobes at the base, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. The plant has no significant commercial use but is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
