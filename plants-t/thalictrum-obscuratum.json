    "intro": "Thalictrum obscuratum, commonly known as the western meadow rue, is a perennial herb native to North America. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, adorned with compound leaves that are finely divided and often bluish-green in color. The plant produces showy, clustered white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on long, slender peduncles. Its root system consists of rhizomes that help it survive in moist, woodland environments. Thalictrum obscuratum is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits to pollinators."
