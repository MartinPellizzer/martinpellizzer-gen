    "intro": "Tectaria grandifolia, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length, often with a distinctive shield-shaped base. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can spread to form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. Tectaria grandifolia is valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
