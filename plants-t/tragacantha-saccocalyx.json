    "intro": "Tragacantha saccocalyx, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are typically small and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Tragacantha saccocalyx is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
