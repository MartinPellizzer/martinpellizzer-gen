    "intro": "Torreya montana, commonly known as the California torreya, is a rare evergreen conifer native to the coastal regions of northern California and southern Oregon. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and conical shape, typically growing in moist, shaded habitats. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Torreya montana is considered endangered due to habitat loss and limited natural range. Its unique botanical features make it an important species for ecological and botanical study."
