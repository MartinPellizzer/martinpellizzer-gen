    "intro": "Trisetella sauliana, commonly known as the Saulian starflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Onagraceae family, which includes species like willows and evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Trisetella sauliana is considered a vulnerable species."
