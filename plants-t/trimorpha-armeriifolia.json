It features lance-shaped leaves with a silvery-white underside, which gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, pale pink to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
