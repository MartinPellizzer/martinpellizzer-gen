    "intro": "Thalictrum pubescens var. hepaticum, commonly known as the liverleaf meadow-rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique addition to gardens and natural habitats."
