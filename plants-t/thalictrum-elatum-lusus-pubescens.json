    "intro": "Thalictrum elatum lusus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems that are densely covered with soft, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in compound umbels. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a delicate, fern-like structure that contributes to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats."
