    "intro": "Taraxacum pertenue, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a long, hollow stem that supports a single, inconspicuous flower head. The flower head produces a cluster of small, yellow tubular flowers that develop into the familiar white, fluffy seed heads. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. This species is known for its resilience and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
