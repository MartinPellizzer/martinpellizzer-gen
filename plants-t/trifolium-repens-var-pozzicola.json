    "intro": "Trifolium repens var. pozzicola, commonly known as the creeping white clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically pale green to white in color, and its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. It is a member of the legume family, capable of nitrogen fixation, which makes it valuable in agricultural and ecological contexts. Its widespread distribution and adaptability make it an important plant in both natural and managed ecosystems."
