It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that emit a strong scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its unique fragrance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in arid gardens."
