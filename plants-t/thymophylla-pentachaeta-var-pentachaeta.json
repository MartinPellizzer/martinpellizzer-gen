    "intro": "Thymophylla pentachaeta var. pentachaeta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thymophylla, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
