    "intro": "Trichomanes acrosorum, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, delicate plant with intricate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Trichomanes acrosorum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
