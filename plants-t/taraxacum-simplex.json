    "intro": "Taraxacum simplex, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which develop into the familiar white, fluffy seed heads. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resilience to environmental stress."
