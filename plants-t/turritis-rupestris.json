    "intro": "Turritis rupestris, commonly known as the rock turritis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, succulent perennial that typically forms dense mats on rocky outcrops. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Turritis rupestris is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
