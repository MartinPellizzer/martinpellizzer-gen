It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a slender trunk and can grow up to 20 meters tall in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The leaves are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
