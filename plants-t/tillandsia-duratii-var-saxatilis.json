    "intro": "Tillandsia duratii var. saxatilis, commonly known as the rock tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. It thrives in well-draining, rocky environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its foliage."
