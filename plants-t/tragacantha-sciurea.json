    "intro": "Tragacantha sciurea, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Iran and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a milky sap, which is harvested for its gum, used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures. Its ecological role includes providing habitat for various desert species and contributing to soil stabilization in arid environments."
