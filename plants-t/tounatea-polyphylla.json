    "intro": "Tounatea polyphylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic life forms. The plant has a distinctive floating leaf structure with a spongy underside that allows it to remain buoyant on water surfaces. Its flowers are showy, typically white or pink, and bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Tounatea polyphylla plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by stabilizing water surfaces and supporting biodiversity."
