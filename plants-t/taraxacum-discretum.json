    "intro": "Taraxacum discretum, commonly known as the discrete dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Native to Europe, it thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a common sight in gardens and natural areas, though it is less showy than other dandelion species."
