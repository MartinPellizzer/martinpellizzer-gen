    "intro": "Triticum repens f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy goatgrass, is a botanical variant of the wild rye species. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage, which distinguishes it from the typical form of Triticum repens. This plant is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in disturbed soils, such as those near roadsides or fields. Its growth habit is perennial, with rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread vegetatively. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers, contributing to its ecological role in soil stabilization and habitat diversity."
