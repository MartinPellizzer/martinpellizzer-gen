    "intro": "Taxodium sempervirens, commonly known as the bald cypress, is a deciduous conifer native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive \"knees,\" which are root protrusions believed to aid in gas exchange. The tree has long, slender needles and produces small, spherical cones. Its bark is reddish-brown and becomes scaly with age. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in swamps and along riverbanks."
