    "intro": "Taraxacum shimushirense, commonly known as the Shizuoka dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Japan, specifically the Shizuoka Prefecture, and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a taproot system and produces a fluffy seed head that disperses its seeds by wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native region."
