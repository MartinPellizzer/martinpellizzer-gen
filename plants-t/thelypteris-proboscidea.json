    "intro": "Thelypteris proboscidea, commonly known as the proboscideous shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its fronds are usually leathery and have a rugged texture, contributing to its unique appearance. Thelypteris proboscidea is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
