    "intro": "Truellum perfoliatum, commonly known as the perfoliate truellum, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are alternate and often have a distinctive perfoliate arrangement, where the base of the leaf appears to pass through the stem. Truellum perfoliatum is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks."
