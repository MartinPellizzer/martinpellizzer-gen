    "intro": "Trifolium erythranthum, commonly known as red clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its pink or purple flower heads that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, and it thrives in a variety of soil types, including those that are dry or rocky. Red clover is often used in agriculture as a forage crop and for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities. Additionally, it has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a component in herbal remedies."
