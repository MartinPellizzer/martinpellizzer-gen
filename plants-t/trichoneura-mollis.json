    "intro": "Trichoneura mollis, commonly known as the soft-haired mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that allow it to absorb water and nutrients from its host. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. It produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds. Trichoneura mollis is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
