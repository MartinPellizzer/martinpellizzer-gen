    "intro": "Triumfetta litticola, commonly known as the coastal triumfetta, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Triumfetta litticola plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
