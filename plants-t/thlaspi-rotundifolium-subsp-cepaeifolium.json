It is characterized by its basal rosette of rounded, fleshy leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. It is a perennial species that is relatively short-lived, reaching heights of up to 20 centimeters. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
