    "intro": "Taraxacum volitans, commonly known as the flying dandelion, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flower heads that open in the morning and close in the evening. The plant produces lightweight, parachute-like seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind, aiding in its widespread distribution. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette and are covered in fine hairs. The species is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields."
