    "intro": "Taraxacum ciconium, commonly known as the meadow dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that bears a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed with a white, pappus that aids in its propagation. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and roadsides. Taraxacum ciconium is known for its medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and diuretic effects."
