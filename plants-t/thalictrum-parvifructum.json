    "intro": "Thalictrum parvifructum, commonly known as the small-fruited meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply divided and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that matures in the fall, releasing tiny seeds. Thalictrum parvifructum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
