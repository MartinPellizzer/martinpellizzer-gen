    "intro": "Trifolium fucatum f. flavulum, commonly known as the yellow clover, is a botanical variant of the common clover species. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers, which contrast with the typical green or white blooms of other clover varieties. This plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three heart-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in temperate climates. The yellow clover is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, contributing to ecological diversity and soil fertility."
