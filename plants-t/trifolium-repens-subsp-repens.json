    "intro": "Trifolium repens subsp. repens, commonly known as white clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides. It has a creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes to form dense mats. White clover is also valued for its role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility."
