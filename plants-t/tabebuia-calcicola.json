    "intro": "Tabebuia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone ceiba, is a deciduous tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in white or pink hues. The tree thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, which is reflected in its scientific name. Its leaves are alternate and palmately lobed, contributing to its ornamental value. The wood of Tabebuia calcicola is durable and has been used in traditional construction and furniture-making."
