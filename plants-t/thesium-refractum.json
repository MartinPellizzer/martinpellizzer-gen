    "intro": "Thesium refractum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thesium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or reddish in color. The plant produces small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its often harsh habitat. Thesium refractum is typically found in acidic soils in open, sunny environments such as heathlands and rocky areas. It is a perennial plant that blooms in late spring to early summer."
