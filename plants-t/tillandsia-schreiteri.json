    "intro": "Tillandsia schreiteri, commonly known as the Schreiter's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale blue, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a sought-after plant among bromeliad enthusiasts."
