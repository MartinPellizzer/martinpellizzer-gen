    "intro": "Tragacantha urmiensis, commonly known as the Urmi thornapple, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Iran. It belongs to the Astragalus genus, which is part of the legume family, Fabaceae. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves, which help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish, and it produces a distinctive seed pod that splits open to release its seeds. Tragacantha urmiensis is also valued for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies."
