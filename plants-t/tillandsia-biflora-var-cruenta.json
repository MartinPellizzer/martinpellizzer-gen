    "intro": "Tillandsia biflora var. cruenta, commonly known as the Crimson Air Plant, is a bromeliad native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers, which bloom in late summer or early fall. It is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
