    "intro": "Typha angustifolia subsp. domingensis, commonly known as narrowleaf cattail, is a perennial wetland plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of two distinct floral parts. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as marshes, pond edges, and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. The plant plays an important ecological role in water filtration and nutrient cycling in wetland ecosystems."
