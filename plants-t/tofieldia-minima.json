    "intro": "Tofieldia minima, commonly known as the dwarf ladies' tresses, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. Tofieldia minima is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
