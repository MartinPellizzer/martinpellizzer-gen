    "intro": "Tournefortia intermedia, commonly known as the white sand dune tree, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant produces showy white or pale yellow flowers, which are clustered in inflorescences and attract various pollinators. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a velvety texture. Tournefortia intermedia is adapted to saline and drought-prone environments, making it a hardy species in arid coastal regions."
