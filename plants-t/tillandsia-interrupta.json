    "intro": "Tillandsia interrupta, commonly known as the silver vane air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer or early fall. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
