    "intro": "Tulipa leichtlinii, commonly known as the Karakul tulip, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep red. The plant typically grows in rocky soils at high altitudes, where it faces harsh environmental conditions. Its bulbs are relatively small and require specific ecological conditions to thrive. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
