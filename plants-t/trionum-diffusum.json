    "intro": "Trionum diffusum, commonly known as creeping yellowseed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread readily along the ground. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Trionum diffusum is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
