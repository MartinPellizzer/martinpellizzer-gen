It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive red aril-covered seeds. This variety is notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, often reaching several centuries in age. The leaves are dark green and needle-like, while the bark is reddish-brown and fissured. It is primarily found in specific regions of Europe and is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation."
