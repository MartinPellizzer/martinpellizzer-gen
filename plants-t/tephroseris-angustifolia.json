    "intro": "Tephroseris angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tephroseris, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions. Its flowers are usually yellow or brown, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Tephroseris angustifolia is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and ecological significance in alpine ecosystems."
