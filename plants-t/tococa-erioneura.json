    "intro": "Tococa erioneura, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds and other animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
