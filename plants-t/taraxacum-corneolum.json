    "intro": "Taraxacum corneolum, commonly known as the Italian dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, ridged stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Taraxacum corneolum is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
