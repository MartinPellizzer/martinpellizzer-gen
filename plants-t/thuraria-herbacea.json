    "intro": "Thuraria herbacea, commonly known as the common thuraria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of about 10-20 centimeters and features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance. Thuraria herbacea thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
