    "intro": "Tragacantha canadensis, commonly known as Canadian tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces a viscous gum from its roots, which has been historically used in medicine and as a binding agent. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and along stream banks. Due to its ecological and historical significance, it is considered an important native plant in certain regions."
