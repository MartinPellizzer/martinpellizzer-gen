    "intro": "Thalictrum perelegans, commonly known as the showy avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and prefers moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, dry fruits that disperse its seeds. Thalictrum perelegans is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
