It features slender, branched stems that typically grow to a height of 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in compound umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided, fern-like leaflets, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
