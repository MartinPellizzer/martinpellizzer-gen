    "intro": "Triticum angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leafed wheat, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and small, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Its seeds are used in traditional agriculture, though it is less commonly cultivated than other wheat species. The plant has also been studied for its potential in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
