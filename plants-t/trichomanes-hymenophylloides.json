    "intro": "Trichomanes hymenophylloides, commonly known as the lace fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, needle-like leaves that form a dense, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its leaves. Trichomanes hymenophylloides is often found growing on trees or rocks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air."
