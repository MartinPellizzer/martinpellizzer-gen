    "intro": "Terminalia whitmorei, commonly known as the Borneo ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and strength. The tree produces small, white flowers followed by elongated, winged fruits that contain seeds. It typically grows in lowland rainforests and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
