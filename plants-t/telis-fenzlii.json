    "intro": "Telis fenzlii, commonly known as the Fenzli's telis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Telis fenzlii is considered a rare and specialized species."
