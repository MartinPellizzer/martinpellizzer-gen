It features a rhizomatous growth habit with upright, lanceolate fronds that are typically bipinnate or tripinnate. The plant produces spores in sporangia that are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris dryopteris thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage often exhibits a rich green color with a slightly serrated margin."
