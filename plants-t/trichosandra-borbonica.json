It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are typically followed by bright red berries. Trichosandra borbonica is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests, where it thrives in the humid climate. Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after species in horticulture, though it is not widely cultivated outside its native range."
