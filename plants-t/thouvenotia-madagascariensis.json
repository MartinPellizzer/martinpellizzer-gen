    "intro": "Thouvenotia madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar rock orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded forest areas, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinct lip that aids in pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
