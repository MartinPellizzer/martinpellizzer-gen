    "intro": "Triticum ovatum, commonly known as the slender wheat, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, each with a single grain. It is primarily cultivated for its seeds, which are used in traditional baking and as a source of flour. Due to its historical significance and limited modern cultivation, Triticum ovatum is considered a relic species in agricultural botany."
