    "intro": "Textoria morbifera, commonly known as the sickly textoria, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant is known for its unique ability to absorb and store moisture from the air, which helps it survive in its moist, shaded habitat. Its roots contain a sap that has been traditionally used in local medicine for its purported healing properties. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Textoria morbifera is now considered endangered."
