    "intro": "Triticum montanum, commonly known as mountain wheat, is a wild grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a blue-green hue, and it has a compact root system adapted to harsh conditions. While not cultivated for grain production, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
