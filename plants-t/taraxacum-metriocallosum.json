    "intro": "Taraxacum metriocallosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a stem that bears a single, inconspicuous flower head. The plant produces a capsule containing numerous seeds with white, feathery pappi, which are dispersed by the wind. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The species is relatively small, typically growing to a height of less than 20 centimeters."
