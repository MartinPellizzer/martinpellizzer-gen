    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. pampilonae, commonly known as the Pampas wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its adaptation to temperate climates. This variety is notable for its shorter stature and lower protein content compared to standard wheat, making it suitable for specific agricultural uses. It possesses a robust root system that allows it to thrive in diverse soil conditions. The plant typically produces compact spikes with small, hard grains, which are well-suited for processing into flour. Its genetic traits make it an important resource for breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience and yield."
