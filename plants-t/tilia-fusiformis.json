    "intro": "Tilia fusiformis, commonly known as the spindle-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy underneath. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The wood of Tilia fusiformis is lightweight and has been historically used for carving and furniture."
