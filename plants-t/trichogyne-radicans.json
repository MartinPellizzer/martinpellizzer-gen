    "intro": "Trichogyne radicans, commonly known as the creeping trichogyne, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with sprawling stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Trichogyne radicans is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
