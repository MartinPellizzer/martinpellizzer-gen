    "intro": "Taraxacum chlorostephum, commonly known as the greensteph yellowstar, is a species of flowering plant in the daisy family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, spoon-shaped leaves and a single, showy yellow flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Central Asia and is typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It has a taproot system and produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
