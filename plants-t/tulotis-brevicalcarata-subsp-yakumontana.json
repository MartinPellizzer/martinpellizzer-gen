    "intro": "Tulotis brevicalcarata subsp. yakumontana, commonly known as the Yakumontan tulotis, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
