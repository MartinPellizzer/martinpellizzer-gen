    "intro": "Tillandsia gardneri var. virescens, commonly known as the green tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup to collect water. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its foliage is typically green to blue-green, with some varieties displaying a striking silver or white variegation. This plant thrives in humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain its health."
