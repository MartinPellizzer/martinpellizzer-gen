    "intro": "Torilis microcarpa, commonly known as lesser cow-wheat, is a small annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant has slender, hairy stems and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy surface. The seeds are small and enclosed in a cupule, which aids in their dispersal by wind or animals."
