    "intro": "Tragacantha wrightii, commonly known as Wright's tragacanth, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds, and its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat. The plant's roots can also store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions."
