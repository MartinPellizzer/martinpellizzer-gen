    "intro": "Trifolium arvense var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in meadows. Narrow-leaved clover is a hardy species that plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in forage agriculture."
