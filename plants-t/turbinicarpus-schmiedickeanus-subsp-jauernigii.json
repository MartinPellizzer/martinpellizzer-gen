    "intro": "Turbinicarpus schmiedickeanus subsp. jauernigii, commonly known as the Jauernig's turbinated cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed stem that develops a flattened, disc-like shape as it matures. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short, erect pedicels. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted for water storage, and its spines are short and often whitish in color. This subspecies is prized by cactus enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
