    "intro": "Taraxacum planum, commonly known as the flat dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. It has a taproot system and is known for its ability to spread via wind-dispersed seeds. The leaves and flowers are used in traditional herbal medicine for their potential diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
