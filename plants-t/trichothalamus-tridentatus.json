Its leaves are divided into three lobes, each with a serrated edge, giving it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Trichothalamus tridentatus plays a vital role in its ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
