    "intro": "Tragacantha subumbellata, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves that are typically alternate and pinnate. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbellate inflorescences, which give it its species name. Its sap, known as tragacanth, is a viscous substance used in traditional medicine and as a natural gum in various industries. Tragacantha subumbellata thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks."
