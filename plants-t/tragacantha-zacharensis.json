    "intro": "Tragacantha zacharensis, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Iran and the Middle East. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces a yellowish resin known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Tragacantha zacharensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
