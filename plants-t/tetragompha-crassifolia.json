    "intro": "Tetragompha crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed tetragompha, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, providing a dense foliage structure. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can spread laterally, allowing it to colonize open, disturbed soils effectively. Tetragompha crassifolia is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained conditions."
