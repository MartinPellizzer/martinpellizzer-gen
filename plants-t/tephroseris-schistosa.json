    "intro": "Tephroseris schistosa, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dry, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Tephroseris schistosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a drought-tolerant plant."
