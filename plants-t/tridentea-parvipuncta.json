    "intro": "Tridentea parvipuncta, commonly known as the small-punctured trident, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet bearing small, raised dots that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its unique appearance and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
