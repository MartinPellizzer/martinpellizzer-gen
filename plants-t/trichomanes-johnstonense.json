    "intro": "Trichomanes johnstonense, commonly known as Johnston's huperzia, is a rare fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that often reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has a distinctive, creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread along the forest floor in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are pinnately divided and have a leathery texture, with spores produced on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
