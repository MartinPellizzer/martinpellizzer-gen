    "intro": "Trisetum johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its slender, triangular stems are covered in fine, hair-like structures, and it produces small, clustered flowers in late spring or early summer. Trisetum johnstonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
