    "intro": "Trisetum frondosum, commonly known as the fronded wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-angled spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Trisetum frondosum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
