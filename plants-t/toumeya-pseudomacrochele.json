It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant has a woody stem with smooth, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal."
