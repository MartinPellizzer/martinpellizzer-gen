It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with three leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It contains urushiol, a potent allergen that can cause severe skin irritation upon contact. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in both natural and cultivated settings."
