    "intro": "Tillandsia tessellata subsp. sanderae, commonly known as the Sanderae air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, pointed leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding ornamental value. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
