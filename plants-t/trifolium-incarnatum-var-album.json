    "intro": "Trifolium incarnatum var. album, commonly known as the white clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. This plant is a perennial herb that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. It has a deep root system that helps in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil fertility. The plant is also known for its ability to spread through stolons, forming dense mats that can suppress weeds."
