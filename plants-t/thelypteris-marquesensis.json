    "intro": "Thelypteris marquesensis, commonly known as the Marquesan holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly the Marquesas Islands. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its spores are released from sori that are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
