    "intro": "Triglochin tenuifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white or pale green flowers in spikes during the summer months. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from waterlogged soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Triglochin tenuifolia is also used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
