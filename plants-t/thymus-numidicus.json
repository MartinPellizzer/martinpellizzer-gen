    "intro": "Thymus numidicus, commonly known as Algerian thyme, is a perennial herb native to North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and small, fragrant leaves that emit a strong thyme scent. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense, glandular inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its aromatic properties make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications."
