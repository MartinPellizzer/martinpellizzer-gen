It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments.

The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
