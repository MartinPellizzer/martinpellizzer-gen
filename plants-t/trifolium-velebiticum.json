    "intro": "Trifolium velebiticum, commonly known as the Velebit clover, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
