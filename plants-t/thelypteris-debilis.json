    "intro": "Thelypteris debilis, commonly known as the fragile shield fern, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Thelypteris debilis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
