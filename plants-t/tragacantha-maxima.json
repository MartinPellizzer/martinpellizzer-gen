    "intro": "Tragacantha maxima, commonly known as the greater tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a viscous gum, known as tragacanth, which is harvested from its bark. This gum has been historically used in medicine, food, and as a thickening agent. Tragacantha maxima thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
