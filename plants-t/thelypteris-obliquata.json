    "intro": "Thelypteris obliquata, commonly known as the slant-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of roots, which helps in water retention. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, slanted venation pattern that gives the plant its common name."
