It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. It is often found in scrublands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in full sun. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
