    "intro": "Toxicodendron glabrum, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with 11 to 31 leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fuzzy berries that are highly attractive to birds. Toxicodendron glabrum contains urushiol, a toxic resin that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. It is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is part of the Anacardiaceae family."
