It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by long, feathery seed heads that resemble a goat's beard. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to various parts of North America. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Tragopogon plantagineus is often found growing in clusters, with lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and slightly lobed."
