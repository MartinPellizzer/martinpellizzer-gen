It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It often grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Tristachya spicata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in moist environments."
