    "intro": "Thecophyllum, commonly known as the \"bottlebrush plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Myrtaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive inflorescence, which consists of dense clusters of red or pink bracts that resemble a bottlebrush. These bracts are modified leaves that serve as a protective covering for the small, inconspicuous flowers. Thecophyllum species are typically shrubs or small trees, often found in coastal or tropical regions. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in horticulture for their vibrant, long-lasting floral displays."
