    "intro": "Tetragastris breviacuminata, commonly known as the short-aculeate tetragastris, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species within its family."
