    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 weisenbeckii, commonly known as hybrid thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, aromatic foliage with small, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or violet flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its use in herbal medicine and culinary applications."
