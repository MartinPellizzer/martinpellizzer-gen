    "intro": "Tectaria \u00d7 michleriana, commonly known as the Michler's shield fern, is a hybrid species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into a series of lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and hybrid origin make it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
