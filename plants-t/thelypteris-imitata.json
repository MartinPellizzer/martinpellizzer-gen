    "intro": "Thelypteris imitata, commonly known as the mimic shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and form dense colonies, which help in stabilizing the soil. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
