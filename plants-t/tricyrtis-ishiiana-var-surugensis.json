    "intro": "Tricyrtis ishiiana var. surugensis, commonly known as the Suruga spider orchid, is a rare and exquisite Japanese orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, spider-like flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, greenish-white inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions of Japan. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
