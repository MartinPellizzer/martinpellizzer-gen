    "intro": "Trachymene pulvilliforma, commonly known as the cushion trachymene, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit, with small, rounded leaves that give it a cushion-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant collections."
