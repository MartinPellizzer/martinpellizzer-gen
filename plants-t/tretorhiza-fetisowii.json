    "intro": "Tretorhiza fetisowii, commonly known as the Philippine bamboo orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, bamboo-like stems and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often epiphytic on tree trunks or branches. Its botanical features include fibrous roots and a compact inflorescence with small, clustered blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
