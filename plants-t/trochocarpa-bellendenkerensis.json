    "intro": "Trochocarpa bellendenkerensis, commonly known as the Bellendenker's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its elongated, fleshy pseudobulbs and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in a spiral arrangement. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or in the understorey of dense vegetation. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
