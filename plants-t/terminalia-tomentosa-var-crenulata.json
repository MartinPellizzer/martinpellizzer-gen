It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring, giving it a snowball-like appearance. The leaves are typically elliptical, with a hairy texture on both sides, and the bark is smooth and pale. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This plant is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and showy blooms."
