    "intro": "Tectaria warburii, commonly known as the Warburton's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive shield-like appearance. The plant is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of sori, which are clusters of sporangia used for spore production. Tectaria warburii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens."
