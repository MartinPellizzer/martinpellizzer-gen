    "intro": "Triadenum fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's triadenum, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its small, greenish-white flowers bloom in late spring and are pollinated by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Triadenum fraseri is considered a species of conservation concern."
