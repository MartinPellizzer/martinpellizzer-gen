    "intro": "Tapeinophallus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, and they bloom in clusters. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, Tapeinophallus is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions."
