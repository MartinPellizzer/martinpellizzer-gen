    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum subsp. atratum, commonly known as naked rye, is a wild wheat species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hollow stems and the absence of a protective hull around its grains, which distinguishes it from other rye varieties. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and produces spikelets that are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in cooler, temperate climates. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its genetic diversity and potential for use in breeding programs."
