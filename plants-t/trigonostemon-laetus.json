    "intro": "Trigonostemon laetus, commonly known as the hairy ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
