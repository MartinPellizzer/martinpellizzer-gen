    "intro": "Thalictrum torresii, commonly known as the Torres' meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along streambanks. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse its seeds. Thalictrum torresii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and early spring blooms."
