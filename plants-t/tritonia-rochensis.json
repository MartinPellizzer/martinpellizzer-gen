    "intro": "Tritonia rochensis, commonly known as the Rochens Island bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant produces showy, pendulous blooms that attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Tritonia rochensis is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat and thrives in well-drained, fertile soils. Its unique floral structure and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
