    "intro": "Trisetum leve, commonly known as slender basket grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense clumps. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a soft texture, and the plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Trisetum leve is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect and bird life."
