    "intro": "Trifolium tomentosum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous hairy vetch, is a variant of the hairy vetch species native to Europe. It is a leguminous plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment and ecological restoration. The glabrescens variety is distinguished by its reduced pubescence compared to other forms of Trifolium tomentosum."
