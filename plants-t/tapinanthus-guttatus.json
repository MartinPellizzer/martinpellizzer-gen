    "intro": "Tapinanthus guttatus, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a flowering plant in the Convolvulaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves and produces violet or purple flowers that bloom in the morning. It is native to regions of Africa and is often found growing on the roots of other plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host if left unchecked."
