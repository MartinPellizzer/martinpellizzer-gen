    "intro": "Thymus rudis, commonly known as rough thyme, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its small, fragrant leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and borders. Its aromatic foliage contains essential oils, which are used in both culinary and medicinal applications. Thymus rudis is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
