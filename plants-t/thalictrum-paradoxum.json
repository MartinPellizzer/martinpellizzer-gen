    "intro": "Thalictrum paradoxum, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, usually white or greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are actinomorphic, with numerous stamens and a single pistil, and it is pollinated primarily by insects. Thalictrum paradoxum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and early spring blooms."
