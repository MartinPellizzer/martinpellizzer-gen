    "intro": "Thalictrum gallicum subsp. stipellatum, commonly known as the slender meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, compound leaves that are often arranged in a whorled pattern along its stem. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in upright, branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to wetland restoration projects and native plant gardens."
