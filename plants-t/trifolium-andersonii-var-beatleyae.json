    "intro": "Trifolium andersonii var. beatleyae, commonly known as Beatley's clover, is a rare and specialized plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which typically consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as pine flatwoods. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for ecological studies and conservation efforts."
