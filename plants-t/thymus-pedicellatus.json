It features small, needle-like leaves that are aromatic and often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its compact size and hardy nature make it a popular choice for ground cover in Mediterranean climates."
