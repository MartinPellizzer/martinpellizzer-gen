    "intro": "Tetrapilus roseus, commonly known as the rose-spurred orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking pink and white floral structure, with petals that have a distinctive rose-like appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters, producing a fragrant scent that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural habitat, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
