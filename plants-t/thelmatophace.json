    "intro": "Thelmatophace, commonly known as the \"sac fungi,\" is a group of ascomycete fungi characterized by their unique reproductive structures. These fungi produce spores within sac-like asci, which are typically arranged in a distinctive, clustered pattern. Thelmatophace species are often found in moist environments, such as on decaying wood or in soil. Their life cycle involves both sexual and asexual reproduction, contributing to their ecological versatility. The genus is notable for its role in decomposing organic matter and recycling nutrients in ecosystems."
