    "intro": "Triticum speltoides subsp. polyatherum, commonly known as the wild einkorn wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with awned lemmas, typical of the tribe Avenae. Its seeds are enclosed in glumes, and it is often found in disturbed soils and rocky habitats. This species is considered an ancient relative of modern wheat and has potential for use in breeding programs for improved crop resilience."
