    "intro": "Tacazzea brazzaeana, commonly known as the Zanzibar orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the island of Zanzibar. It is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the family Orchidaceae, characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that bloom in a striking shade of pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in coastal forests or near mangroves. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Tacazzea brazzaeana faces significant threats to its survival."
