    "intro": "Trifolium repens var. subvillosum, commonly known as the hairy white clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are usually hairy, giving it its specific epithet *subvillosum*. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. This variety is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage crop for livestock."
