    "intro": "Teucrium polium var. pilosum, commonly known as creeping germander, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry, well-drained conditions."
