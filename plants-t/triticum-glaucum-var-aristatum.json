It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of wax. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine in some regions."
