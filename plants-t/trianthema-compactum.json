It features small, fleshy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland areas with high salinity. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects in saline habitats."
