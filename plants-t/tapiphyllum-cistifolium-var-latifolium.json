    "intro": "Tapiphyllum cistifolium var. latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved tapiphyllum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species with unique botanical characteristics. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, known for its showy and often toxic flowers. The plant is distinguished by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. Its flowers are usually clustered in umbels and feature a distinctive corolla with five lobes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
