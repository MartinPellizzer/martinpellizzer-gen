    "intro": "Tillandsia squamulosa, commonly known as the silver tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves. The leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid environments and can be found growing on trees or rocks. This epiphytic plant does not require soil and is often cultivated as a decorative plant."
