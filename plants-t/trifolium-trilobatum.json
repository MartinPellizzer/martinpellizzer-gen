    "intro": "Trifolium trilobatum, commonly known as the three-lobed clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to parts of Asia, particularly China, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in early spring. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Trifolium trilobatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
