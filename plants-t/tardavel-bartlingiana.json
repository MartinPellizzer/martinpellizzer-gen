    "intro": "Tardavel bartlingiana, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, branching stems that rise from a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Tardavel bartlingiana is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
