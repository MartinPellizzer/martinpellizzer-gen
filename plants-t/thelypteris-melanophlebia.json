    "intro": "Thelypteris melanophlebia, commonly known as the black-stemmed shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Thelypteris melanophlebia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining forest understory biodiversity."
