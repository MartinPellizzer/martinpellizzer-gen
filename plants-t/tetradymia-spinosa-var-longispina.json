    "intro": "Tetradymia spinosa var. longispina, commonly known as the long-spined globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native pollinators."
