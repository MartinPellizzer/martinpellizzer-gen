    "intro": "Tillandsia stricta var. paraguariensis, commonly known as the Paraguayan air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. This variety is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
