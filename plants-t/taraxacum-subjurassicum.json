    "intro": "Taraxacum subjurassicum, commonly known as the Jurassic dandelion, is a rare and ancient species of flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, much like other dandelions, but it is less common due to habitat loss and environmental changes. This species is of particular interest to botanists due to its potential links to prehistoric plant evolution."
