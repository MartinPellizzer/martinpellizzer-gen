    "intro": "Tribrachia odoratissima, commonly known as the sweet-scented fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that emit a subtle, fragrant aroma, particularly when touched or exposed to moisture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing capsules, are typically located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its ornamental value and pleasant scent, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
