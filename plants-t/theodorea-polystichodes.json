    "intro": "Theodorea polystichodes, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, feather-like fronds that are often adorned with golden spore clusters. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil to flourish. Its unique appearance makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and private collections. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
