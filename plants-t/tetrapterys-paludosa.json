    "intro": "Tetrapterys paludosa, commonly known as the swamp tetrapterys, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in marshy environments. Tetrapterys paludosa plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various insects and small aquatic organisms."
