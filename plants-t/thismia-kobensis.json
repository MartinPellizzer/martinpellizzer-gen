    "intro": "Thismia kobensis, commonly known as the Korean ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to South Korea. It belongs to the family Thismiaceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungal networks for nutrients. The plant produces striking, white, lantern-like flowers that are often mistaken for fungi due to their appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in forest understories. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered a critically endangered species."
