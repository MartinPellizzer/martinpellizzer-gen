    "intro": "Tontelea miersii, commonly known as the Miers' tontelea, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous environments. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range in color from white to pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tontelea miersii is considered a species of conservation concern."
