    "intro": "Thalictrum flavum subsp. exaltatum, commonly known as the golden meadow-rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with prominent, showy stamens that attract pollinators. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its woodland habitat, with a rhizomatous root system supporting its growth in nutrient-rich soils."
