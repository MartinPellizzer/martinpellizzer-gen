    "intro": "Trichomanes obscurum, commonly known as the dark holly fern, is a member of the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are narrow and have a leathery texture, with a dark green color that becomes more pronounced in shade. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called soruses on the underside of its fronds. Trichomanes obscurum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded microhabitats."
