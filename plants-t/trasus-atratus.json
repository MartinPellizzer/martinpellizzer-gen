    "intro": "Trasus atratus, commonly known as the black-backed fern, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves with a distinct blackish-purple underside. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are typically hidden within a spadix, a common feature in the arum family. Trasus atratus thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or dense undergrowth. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings, though it remains relatively rare in the global trade."
