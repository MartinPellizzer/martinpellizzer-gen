    "intro": "Taraxacum cuspidatiforme, commonly known as the spiky dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often pointed, giving it its specific epithet. The plant produces a hollow, spiky stem that supports a single flower head, which develops into a fluffy seed sphere after flowering. It is native to regions of Europe and Asia and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a common weed in many areas."
