It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often covered with small, spore-producing structures called sporangia. The fronds are usually divided into small, pointed segments, giving the plant a distinctive, feathery appearance."
