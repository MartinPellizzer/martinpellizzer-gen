    "intro": "Tritoniopsis apiculata var. minor, commonly known as the small-leafed tritoniopsis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many ornamental and horticulturally significant species. The plant is characterized by its small, ovate leaves and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging species to cultivate outside its native range."
