    "intro": "Trachystoma aphanoneurum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity and moderate temperatures. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions."
