    "intro": "Thymus vulgaris var. hyemalis, commonly known as winter thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features small, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of pale pink to lavender flowers. The plant is characterized by its aromatic foliage, which contains essential oils responsible for its distinctive scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Winter thyme is valued for its hardiness and ability to bloom during colder months."
