It is native to southern Europe and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to drought conditions. It produces small, woody cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind. The species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
