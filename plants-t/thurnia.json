    "intro": "Thurnia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Peru. The plants are characterized by their small, bell-shaped flowers that often have a ghostly or translucent appearance. Thurnia species typically grow as shrubs or herbs, and they are known for their unique floral structures and adaptations to humid, tropical environments. These plants are of interest to botanists due to their morphological diversity and ecological significance in their native habitats."
