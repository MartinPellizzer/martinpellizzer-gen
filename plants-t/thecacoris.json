    "intro": "Thecacoris, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying solely on its roots for nutrients. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Thecacoris is listed as endangered in many regions."
