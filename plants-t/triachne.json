    "intro": "Triachne, commonly known as false brome, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plants typically have slender, grass-like leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. They are often found in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Triachne species are generally annual or perennial herbs, depending on the specific species and environmental conditions."
