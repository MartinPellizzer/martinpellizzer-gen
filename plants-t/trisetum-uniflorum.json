    "intro": "Trisetum uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear a single flower per spike. Its botanical features include rhizomes and a fibrous root system, which help it thrive in waterlogged soils. Trisetum uniflorum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
