It belongs to the family Achatinellidae and is native to the rainforests of South America. The snail is characterized by its large, spiral-shaped shell that is typically smooth and glossy. It thrives in humid environments and plays a role in seed dispersal and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
