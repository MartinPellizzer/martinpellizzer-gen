    "intro": "Tium obcordatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in the spring. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Tium obcordatum thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, temperate climate to flourish."
