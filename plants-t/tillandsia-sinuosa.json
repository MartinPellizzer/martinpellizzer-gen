    "intro": "Tillandsia sinuosa, commonly known as the silver vane air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a silvery, woolly coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink in color. It is native to Central and South America and thrives in humid, shaded environments."
