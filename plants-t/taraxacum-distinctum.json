    "intro": "Taraxacum distinctum, commonly known as the distinct dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy white pappus for wind dispersal. Native to Europe, it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is perennial, with a taproot that allows it to survive in various environmental conditions. Its botanical features make it a common and recognizable weed in many regions."
