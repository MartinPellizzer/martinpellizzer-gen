    "intro": "Taraxacum cherwellense, commonly known as the Cherwell dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces a rosette of spoon-shaped leaves with a hairy surface, and it features a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. Its flowers develop into distinctive white, pappus-equipped seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. This species is noted for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
