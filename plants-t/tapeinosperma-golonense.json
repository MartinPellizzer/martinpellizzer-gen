    "intro": "Tapeinosperma golonense, commonly known as the Golonese tamarind, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of western Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody pods containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in local traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
