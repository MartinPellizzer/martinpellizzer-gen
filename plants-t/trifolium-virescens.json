    "intro": "Trifolium virescens, commonly known as the green clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Trifolium virescens is typically found in moist, temperate regions and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Its growth habit and botanical features make it an important component of diverse grassland ecosystems."
