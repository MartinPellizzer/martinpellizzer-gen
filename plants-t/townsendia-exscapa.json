    "intro": "Townsendia exscapa, commonly known as the alpine sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at altitudes above 7,000 feet. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, which bloom in late summer. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to cold, harsh alpine environments. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
