    "intro": "Tassadia apocynella, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species known for their milky sap. Tassadia apocynella is adapted to dry environments and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
