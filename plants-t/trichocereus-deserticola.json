    "intro": "Trichocereus deserticola, commonly known as the desert torch cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a spiny exterior with areoles that bear both spines and flowers. It is adapted to extreme desert conditions with deep roots and a thick cuticle to reduce water loss. Due to its striking appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
