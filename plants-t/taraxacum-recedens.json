    "intro": "Taraxacum recedens, commonly known as the creeping dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that produces a single composite flower head. The plant has a taproot system and is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. Its flowers typically bloom in the spring and summer, producing a yellow disk surrounded by white ray florets. The plant is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in many habitats."
