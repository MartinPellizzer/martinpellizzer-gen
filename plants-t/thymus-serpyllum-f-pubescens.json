It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant features dense, compact foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. Its flowers are typically pink to violet, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom in early summer. This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
