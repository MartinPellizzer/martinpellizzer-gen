    "intro": "Thelypteris demissa, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces sporangia that release spores for propagation. Thelypteris demissa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
