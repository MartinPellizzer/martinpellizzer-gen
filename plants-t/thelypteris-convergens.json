    "intro": "Thelypteris convergens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or wooded areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Thelypteris convergens plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
