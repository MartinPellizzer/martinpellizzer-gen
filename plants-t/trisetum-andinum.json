    "intro": "Trisetum andinum, commonly known as the Andean hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. Its ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions makes it an important component of Andean ecosystems. Trisetum andinum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms."
