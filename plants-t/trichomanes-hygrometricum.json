    "intro": "Trichomanes hygrometricum, commonly known as the moisture-loving fern, is a small, delicate plant belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in tiny, scale-like structures. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes hygrometricum is well adapted to high moisture levels and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in moist, forested areas."
