    "intro": "Tissa diandra, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, with leaves that are heart-shaped and often marked with silver or white veins. Its flowers, which come in shades of purple, blue, and white, are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects. Tissa diandra is popular as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in indirect light and its ornamental value."
