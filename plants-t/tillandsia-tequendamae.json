    "intro": "Tillandsia tequendamae, commonly known as the Tequendama air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the Andes Mountains of Colombia. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking purple or red flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and moderate light exposure. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated as a rare and exotic houseplant."
