    "intro": "Thelypodium torulosum, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. Thelypodium torulosum is valued for its ability to thrive in extreme conditions, making it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
