    "intro": "Tetraria capillaris, commonly known as the slender tetraria, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, oval fruits known as schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. Tetraria capillaris is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its botanical features make it a notable subject in ecological and taxonomic studies."
