    "intro": "Tapinanthus entebbensis, commonly known as the Entebbe dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to East Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the stems or leaves of other plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a weak, vine-like structure. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along riverbanks. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause damage to its host plants, making it both ecologically significant and potentially harmful to agricultural crops."
