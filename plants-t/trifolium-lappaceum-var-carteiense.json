    "intro": "Trifolium lappaceum var. carteiense, commonly known as the Carpathian clover, is a perennial herb native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, typically with three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
