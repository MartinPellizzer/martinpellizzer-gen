    "intro": "Tristellateia greveana subvar. douillotii, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and green foliage, with clusters of star-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a short rhizome and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections."
