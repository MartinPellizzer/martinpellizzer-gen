    "intro": "Thelypteris burksiorum, commonly known as the Burks' water fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically borne on creeping rhizomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as swampy woodlands and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family. Thelypteris burksiorum plays an important ecological role in maintaining wetland habitats and supporting local biodiversity."
