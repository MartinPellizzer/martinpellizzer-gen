    "intro": "Taraxacum triangulare, commonly known as the triangular dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of triangular, serrated leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces a single, hollow, yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed head known as a pappus. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Taraxacum triangulare is a perennial herb that is relatively easy to cultivate and is sometimes used in herbal medicine."
