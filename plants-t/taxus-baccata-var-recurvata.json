    "intro": "Taxus baccata var. recurvata, commonly known as the curly leaf yew, is a rare variant of the European yew. It is characterized by its distinctive, twisted, and curling foliage, which sets it apart from the standard Taxus baccata. The plant is evergreen, with dark green, needle-like leaves that form dense, compact clusters. It produces small, red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. This variety is typically found in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
