    "intro": "Timandra serrata, commonly known as the serrated timandra, is a flowering plant native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. The plant features slender, wiry stems and small, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, giving it its common name. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the spring and summer months. Timandra serrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
