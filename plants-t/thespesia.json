These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the world, including the Pacific Islands, Africa, and the Caribbean. Thespesia species are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The leaves are usually large, opposite, and often have a rough or hairy texture. Many Thespesia species are valued for their ornamental beauty and are also used in traditional medicine and cultural rituals."
