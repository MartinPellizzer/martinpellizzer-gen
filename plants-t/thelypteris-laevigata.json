    "intro": "Thelypteris laevigata, commonly known as the smooth male fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. Thelypteris laevigata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of understory vegetation in temperate forests."
