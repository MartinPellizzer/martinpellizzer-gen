    "intro": "Tanacetum nitens, commonly known as the alpine tansy, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Tanacetum nitens is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects."
