    "intro": "Thelypteris vaupelii, commonly known as the Vaupel's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks, where it thrives in high humidity. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its leaves, a common feature among ferns. Thelypteris vaupelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens for its attractive foliage."
