    "intro": "Teucrium marum var. spinescens, commonly known as Spiny Germander, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands and moist soils, often found in swampy areas and along the edges of ponds. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are clustered in dense, terminal spikes. It produces tiny, blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. The variety is distinguished by its spiny or bristly appearance, which gives it its common name."
