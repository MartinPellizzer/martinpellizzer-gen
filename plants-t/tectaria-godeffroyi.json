    "intro": "Tectaria godeffroyi, commonly known as the Godeffroy's shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures that provide protection and aid in water retention. Tectaria godeffroyi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
