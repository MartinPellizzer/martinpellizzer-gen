    "intro": "Tragacantha tournefortii, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the dry regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody, branching structure and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, flat, yellowish pods. Its bark and sap have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural gum. Tragacantha tournefortii is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
