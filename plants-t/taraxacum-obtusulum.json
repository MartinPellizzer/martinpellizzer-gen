    "intro": "Taraxacum obtusulum, commonly known as the broadleaf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a spherical seed ball. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. The plant is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
