    "intro": "Trifolium transsilvanicum, commonly known as the Transylvanian clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Europe, particularly found in the Carpathian Mountains region of Romania. This plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and forest edges. Trifolium transsilvanicum plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation, making it ecologically significant in its native habitat."
