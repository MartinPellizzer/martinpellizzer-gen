    "intro": "Tupa poeppigiana, commonly known as the velvetleaf or the Mexican velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
