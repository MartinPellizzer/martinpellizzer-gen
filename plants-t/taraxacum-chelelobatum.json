    "intro": "Taraxacum chelelobatum, commonly known as the Chelelobat Taraxacum, is a species of dandelion native to specific regions in Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces a capsule containing numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and semi-desert environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
