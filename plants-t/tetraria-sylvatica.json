    "intro": "Tetraria sylvatica, commonly known as the forest tetraria, is a rare and delicate plant species native to temperate woodlands. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in areas with rich, loamy soil. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
