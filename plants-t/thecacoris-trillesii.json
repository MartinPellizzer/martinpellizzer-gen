    "intro": "Thecacoris trillesii, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, with six petals and a prominent central stamen. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability. Thecacoris trillesii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
