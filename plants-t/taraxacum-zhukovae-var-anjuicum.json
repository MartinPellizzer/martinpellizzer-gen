    "intro": "Taraxacum zhukovae var. anjuicum, commonly known as the Anjuikum dandelion, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, elongated leaves and yellow composite flowers typical of the dandelion genus. The plant produces a distinctive seed head with pappus that aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
