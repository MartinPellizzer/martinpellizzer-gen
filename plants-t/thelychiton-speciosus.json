It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory species in humid, shaded forest environments. Its ornamental value is largely due to its attractive foliage and unique floral structure.
