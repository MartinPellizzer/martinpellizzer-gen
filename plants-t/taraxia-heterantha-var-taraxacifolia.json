    "intro": "Taraxia heterantha var. taraxacifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces a single, tall, hollow stem that bears a yellow composite flower head, which develops into a crown of white, fluffy seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. The species is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology and is often confused with other dandelion species due to its similar floral structure."
