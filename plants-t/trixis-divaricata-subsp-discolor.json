    "intro": "Trixis divaricata subsp. discolor, commonly known as the white-flowered trixis, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the cooler months. It is adapted to well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy plant in dry climates. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a valuable species for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
