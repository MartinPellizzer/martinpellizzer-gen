    "intro": "Triticum repens var. pungens, commonly known as the hairy oat, is a grass species characterized by its slender, erect stems and hairy leaves. It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and have a bluish-green hue, with prominent pubescence along the midrib. This variety is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
