    "intro": "Tillandsia yutaninoensis, commonly known as the Yutanino air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture from the air. Its inflorescence produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Tillandsia genus."
