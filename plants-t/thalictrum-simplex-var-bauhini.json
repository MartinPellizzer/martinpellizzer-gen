It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemose inflorescences. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided leaflets that give it a feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
