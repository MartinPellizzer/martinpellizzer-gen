    "intro": "Trillium sulcatum f. albolutescens, commonly known as the white-flowered yellow trillium, is a rare and striking variant of the yellow trillium. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white petals, which contrast sharply with its deep green foliage. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is native to the eastern United States. The flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully expand. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable and vulnerable species in botanical conservation efforts."
