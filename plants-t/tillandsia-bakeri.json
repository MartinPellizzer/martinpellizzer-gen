    "intro": "Tillandsia bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in capturing and retaining water. It produces small, colorful inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
