    "intro": "Tephrocactus hypogaeus, commonly known as the underground cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its subterranean stem, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that emerge from the soil surface during the warm season. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Despite its underground growth habit, Tephrocactus hypogaeus plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by supporting pollinators and contributing to soil stability."
