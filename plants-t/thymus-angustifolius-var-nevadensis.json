It features small, narrow leaves that are densely packed along its stems, giving it a compact, mat-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, pink to purple flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, which contribute to its use in herbal medicine and as a culinary herb. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments."
