    "intro": "Trichocephalus litoralis, commonly known as the coastal thread-seed, is a flowering plant native to sandy coastal regions. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a deep root system that helps stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. It thrives in well-drained, saline soils and is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Trichocephalus litoralis plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates."
