    "intro": "Tilia caroliniana var. floridana, commonly known as the Florida basswood, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are usually smooth and bright green on top with a lighter underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are highly attractive to pollinators. Its bark is grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age, and it typically grows to a height of 20 to 30 feet. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
