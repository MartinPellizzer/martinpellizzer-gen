    "intro": "Trisetum variabile var. virescens, commonly known as the variable beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a bluish-green hue. Its inflorescence consists of a single, dense spikelet that is usually pale green to reddish in color. This variety is notable for its variability in morphology, which contributes to its adaptability in different wetland environments."
