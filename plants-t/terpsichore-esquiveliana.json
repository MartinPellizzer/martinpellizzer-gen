    "intro": "Terpsichore esquiveliana, commonly known as the Esquivel's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on tree branches or in shaded, humid environments, relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its small, strap-like leaves are adapted to conserve moisture in its native habitat. Due to habitat destruction and its elusive nature, it is considered critically endangered and is rarely seen in the wild."
