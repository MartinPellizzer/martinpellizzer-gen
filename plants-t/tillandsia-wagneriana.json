    "intro": "Tillandsia wagneriana, commonly known as the Wagner's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water. It produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
