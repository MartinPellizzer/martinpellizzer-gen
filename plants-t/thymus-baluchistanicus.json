    "intro": "Thymus baluchistanicus, commonly known as Baluchistan thyme, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to dry, harsh environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
