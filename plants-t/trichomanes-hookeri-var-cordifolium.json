    "intro": "Trichomanes hookeri var. cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-leaf water fern, is a fern species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the undersides of its leaves. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in aquatic or bog gardens."
