    "intro": "Thelypteris lauterbachii, commonly known as the Lauterbach's holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, where it can receive the necessary humidity and indirect light. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
