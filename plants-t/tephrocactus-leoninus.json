    "intro": "Tephrocactus leoninus, commonly known as the Leoninus cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus with a globular shape and dark green to bluish-gray stems. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the top of the stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
