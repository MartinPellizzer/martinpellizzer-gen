    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 blechiana, commonly known as the small-leaf lime or European lime, is a hybrid deciduous tree belonging to the Tiliaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are smaller and more pointed compared to other lime species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in urban landscapes for its shade and seasonal interest."
