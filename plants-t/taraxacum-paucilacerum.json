    "intro": "Taraxacum paucilacerum, commonly known as the sparse-hairy dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a single, yellow flower head that develops into a spherical seed ball. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It has a short flowering period in spring and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. The species is notable for its reduced leaf hairs compared to other dandelion species, contributing to its unique botanical appearance."
