    "intro": "Taraxacum sulger-buelii, commonly known as the Sulger-Buelii dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves with a hairy surface, and it produces a yellow flower head that develops into a hollow, spiky seed sphere. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
