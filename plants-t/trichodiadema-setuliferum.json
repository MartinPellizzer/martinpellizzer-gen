    "intro": "Trichodiadema setuliferum, commonly known as the woolly ice plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance make it a valuable addition to arid landscapes."
