    "intro": "Thelypteris rurutensis, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, bipinnate fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal and forested areas. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting the growth of the tall stem. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
