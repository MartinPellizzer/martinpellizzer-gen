    "intro": "Tricholepis spartoides, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It has hairy, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Tricholepis spartoides is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds."
