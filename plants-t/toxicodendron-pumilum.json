    "intro": "Toxicodendron pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf poison ivy, is a small shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being oval with a pointed tip and a hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by reddish or brownish berries. It contains urushiol, a toxic resin that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided or controlled in natural areas to prevent harm to wildlife and people."
