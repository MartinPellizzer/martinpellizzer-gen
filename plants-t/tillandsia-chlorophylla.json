    "intro": "Tillandsia chlorophylla, commonly known as the green tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that is typically a vibrant green color. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Tillandsia chlorophylla is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
