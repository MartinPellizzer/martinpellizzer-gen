    "intro": "Trichomanes pyxidiferum var. organense, commonly known as the Organense Hart's-tongue, is a rare fern species native to specific regions in Mexico. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and covered in fine, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rock surfaces or in humid forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
