    "intro": "Tetraphyllaster, commonly known as the \"four-leafed liverwort,\" is a type of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. The plant has a distinctive thallus structure with a central axis and lateral lobes, giving it a leaf-like appearance. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes. Tetraphyllaster plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its ecosystem."
