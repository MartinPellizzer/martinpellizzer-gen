    "intro": "Trisetum condensatum, commonly known as the dense hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Trisetum condensatum is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse insect populations."
