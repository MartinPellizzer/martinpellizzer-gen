    "intro": "Thelypteris cordata, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically upright and have a distinctive, heart-shaped base. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Thelypteris cordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
