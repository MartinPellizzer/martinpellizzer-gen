    "intro": "Tomophyllum donianum, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, resembling stars, hence its common name. The plant has a cylindrical stem covered in soft, spiny areoles, which support its flowers and branches. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens."
