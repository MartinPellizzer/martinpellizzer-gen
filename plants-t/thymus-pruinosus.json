    "intro": "Thymus pruinosus, commonly known as the silver thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, gray-green foliage covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Thymus pruinosus is also valued for its aromatic properties and is often used in herbal medicine and culinary applications."
