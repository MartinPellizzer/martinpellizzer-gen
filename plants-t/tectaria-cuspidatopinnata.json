    "intro": "Tectaria cuspidatopinnata, commonly known as the pinna-tipped tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its intricate fronds with finely divided pinnae that often have a sharp, pointed tip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as tropical forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, velvety coating, which helps in water retention. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
