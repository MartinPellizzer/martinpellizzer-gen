    "intro": "Thalictrum cuonaense, commonly known as the Cuona mountain avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes buttercups and other flowering plants. The plant features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white, or pale yellow flowers in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
