    "intro": "Trisetum candollei, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and along roadsides. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity. Trisetum candollei is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and landscapes."
