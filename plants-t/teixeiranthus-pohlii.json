    "intro": "Teixeiranthus pohlii, commonly known as the Pohli's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers, which are usually pale green or white, are adapted for pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Teixeiranthus pohlii is considered a vulnerable species."
