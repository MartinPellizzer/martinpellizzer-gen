    "intro": "Theileamea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of Madagascar. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear to shimmer in the sunlight, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers that bloom only at night, releasing a faint, sweet fragrance. Its unique morphology and nocturnal blooming habits make it a subject of fascination for botanists. Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, Theileamea is considered critically endangered."
