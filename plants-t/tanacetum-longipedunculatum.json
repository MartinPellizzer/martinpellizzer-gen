    "intro": "Tanacetum longipedunculatum, commonly known as the slenderleaf tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring finely divided, fern-like leaves and yellow button-like flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in dry meadows and rocky habitats. Tanacetum longipedunculatum is noted for its strong, camphor-like scent, which is attributed to its high content of volatile oils."
