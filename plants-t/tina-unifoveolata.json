    "intro": "Tina unifoveolata, commonly known as the single-veined fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, single-veined fronds that exhibit a unique, almost lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing cones, are small and clustered near the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tina unifoveolata is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
