    "intro": "Trifolium alpestre subsp. lanigerum, commonly known as the alpine hairy trefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often forming dense clusters. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
