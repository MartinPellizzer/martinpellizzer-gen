    "intro": "Tragopogon serotinus, commonly known as late yellow flower, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the dandelion family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow ray florets and a distinctive, hollow, leafy stem. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It produces a tall, flowering stem with a single, showy yellow flower that blooms in late summer to early autumn. Tragopogon serotinus is also known for its ability to hybridize with other Tragopogon species, leading to the creation of new, often sterile, hybrid forms."
