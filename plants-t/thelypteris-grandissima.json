    "intro": "Thelypteris grandissima, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and stream banks. The plant has large, lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters, with a distinctive, floating appearance. Its rhizomes are often submerged, allowing it to spread through vegetative propagation. Thelypteris grandissima plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing water bodies."
