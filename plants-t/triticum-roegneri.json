It is a herbaceous annual plant with slender, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that bear small, oval grains. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a compact, cylindrical stem. Triticum roegneri is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to harsh conditions."
