    "intro": "Tanacetum aureum var. aureum, commonly known as golden buttonweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic when crushed, giving off a subtle minty scent. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is occasionally grown in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
