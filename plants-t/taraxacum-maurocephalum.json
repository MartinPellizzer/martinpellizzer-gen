    "intro": "Taraxacum maurocephalum, commonly known as the black-headed dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features a deep taproot and produces a distinctive, globe-shaped flower head that turns into a pappus-equipped seed head. Its leaves are typically basal, rough, and have a serrated margin. The species is notable for its dark, almost black, flowering head, which contrasts with the typical yellow color of other dandelion species."
