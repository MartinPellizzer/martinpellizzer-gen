    "intro": "Tenageia, commonly known as the mountain grape, is a genus of flowering plants in the Vitaceae family. It consists of several species, primarily found in the southern United States and parts of Mexico. The plants are characterized by their climbing habit, with tendrils that allow them to ascend trees and other structures. Their leaves are typically alternate and have a palmate or trifoliate shape, and they produce small, clustered flowers. The fruits are usually berries, which can be edible and are sometimes used in local cuisines or traditional medicine."
