    "intro": "Taraxacum putidiusculum, commonly known as the stinking dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a milky sap that has a strong, unpleasant odor, which is a distinguishing feature. It is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and waste areas. The species is native to Europe and western Asia but has been introduced to other regions."
