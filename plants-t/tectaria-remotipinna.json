    "intro": "Tectaria remotipinna, commonly known as the distant-pointing tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae, which are often elongated and tapering. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Tectaria remotipinna is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
