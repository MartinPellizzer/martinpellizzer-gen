    "intro": "Tulipa scabriscapa var. primulina, commonly known as the primrose tulip, is a perennial bulbous plant native to Central Asia. It features slender, grass-like foliage and produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The flowers typically bloom in early spring, often before many other tulip varieties. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and dry soils due to its drought tolerance. It is valued for its early blooming habit and delicate appearance."
