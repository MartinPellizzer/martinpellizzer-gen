    "intro": "Tragacantha alindana, commonly known as the Syrian tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and parts of southern Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by distinctive, inflated pods containing seeds. Its most notable feature is the production of a viscous gum, which has been historically used in medicine, food, and as a sizing agent in textile manufacturing."
