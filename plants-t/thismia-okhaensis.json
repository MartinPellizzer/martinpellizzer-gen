    "intro": "Thismia okhaensis, commonly known as the Okha ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the dense forests of northeastern India. It belongs to the family Thismiaceae, a group of plants known for their unique and often striking floral structures. The plant is characterized by its small, white, orchid-like flowers that lack petals and sepals, instead featuring a single, elongated labellum. It is a mycoheterotroph, meaning it derives its nutrients from fungi rather than through photosynthesis. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Thismia okhaensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
