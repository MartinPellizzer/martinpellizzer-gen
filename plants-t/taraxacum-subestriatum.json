    "intro": "Taraxacum subestriatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a hairy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, wind-dispersed seed capsule known as a pappus. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. Taraxacum subestriatum is notable for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
