    "intro": "Tragacantha hilaris, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid regions of Iran and Afghanistan. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a sticky resin, known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent. Its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments makes it an important species in ecological restoration efforts in semi-arid regions."
