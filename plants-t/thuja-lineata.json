    "intro": "Thuja lineata, commonly known as the eastern arborvitae, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are typically a dark green on top and pale white underneath. The plant produces small, round cones that contain seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to form dense hedges. Thuja lineata is also valued for its air-purifying properties and resistance to pests and diseases. Its foliage provides habitat for various wildlife species, contributing to ecological diversity in forest ecosystems."
