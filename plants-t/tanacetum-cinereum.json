It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves and small, blue to purple flowering heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces a strong, aromatic scent due to the presence of essential oils in its leaves and flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Tanacetum cinereum is also valued for its historical use in herbal medicine."
