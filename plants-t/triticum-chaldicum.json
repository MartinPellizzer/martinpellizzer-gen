    "intro": "Triticum chaldicum, commonly known as the Armenian wheat or Chaldic wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wheat native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences that bear tiny, awned grains. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its genetic makeup is of interest to researchers due to its potential for improving modern wheat varieties through breeding programs. However, it is considered endangered due to habitat loss and limited cultivation."
