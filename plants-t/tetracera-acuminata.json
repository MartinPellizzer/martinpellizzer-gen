    "intro": "Tetracera acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tetracera, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Its bark contains latex, which has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas."
