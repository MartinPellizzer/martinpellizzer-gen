It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind.
