    "intro": "Tillandsia santosiae, commonly known as the Santosia air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, silver-green foliage that forms a rosette shape, which helps it collect moisture from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in the summer months. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
