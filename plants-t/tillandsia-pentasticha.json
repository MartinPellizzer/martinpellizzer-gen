    "intro": "Tillandsia pentasticha, commonly known as the star-shaped air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, strap-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, star-shaped inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers. This species is native to Central and South America and is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant."
