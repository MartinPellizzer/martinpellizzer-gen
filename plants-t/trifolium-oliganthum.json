    "intro": "Trifolium oliganthum, commonly known as the lesser clover, is a small perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring. The plant is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soil. It has a low-growing habit and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Trifolium oliganthum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
