    "intro": "Tetragonanthus plantagineus, commonly known as the silverleaf dudleya, is a succulent plant native to southern California and Baja California. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and attractive appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
