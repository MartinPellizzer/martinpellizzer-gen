    "intro": "Thelypteris sinica, commonly known as the Chinese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Thelypteris sinica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
