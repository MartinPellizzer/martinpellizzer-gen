    "intro": "Taeniopetalum arenarium, commonly known as the sand petal tree, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in coastal gardens for its ornamental value."
