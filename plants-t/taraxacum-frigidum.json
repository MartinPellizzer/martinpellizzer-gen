    "intro": "Taraxacum frigidum, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in rocky or well-drained soils. The plant features a rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces a tall, slender stem topped with a single flower head. Its yellow flowers develop into a white, fluffy seed head, characteristic of the dandelion genus. It is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including low temperatures and strong winds."
