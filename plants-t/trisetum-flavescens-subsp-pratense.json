It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, slightly hairy stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow to golden inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, and is often found in disturbed areas."
