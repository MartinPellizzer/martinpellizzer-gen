    "intro": "Thoracosperma interruptum, commonly known as the interrupted mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique root system, which includes both pneumatophores and prop roots, aiding in respiration and stabilization in brackish water environments. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that are opposite and ovate in shape. It produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. This species plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
