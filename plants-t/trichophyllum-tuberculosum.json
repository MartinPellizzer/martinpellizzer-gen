    "intro": "Trichophyllum tuberculosum, commonly known as the cushion lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms dense, compact growths on rocky surfaces in arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dark green to blackish upper surface and a lighter, often whitish lower surface. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungal partner and green algae or cyanobacteria. It thrives in harsh, cold environments where few other plants can survive. This lichen plays an important role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of environmental conditions."
