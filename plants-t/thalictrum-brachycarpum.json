    "intro": "Thalictrum brachycarpum, commonly known as the short-fruited meadow-rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain a single seed. Thalictrum brachycarpum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native pollinators."
