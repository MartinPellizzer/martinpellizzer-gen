    "intro": "Tongoloa, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the M\u0101ori, is a plant with significant cultural and botanical importance. It is a water lily native to New Zealand, characterized by its large, showy flowers and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, and is often found in wetland areas. Its flowers open in the morning and close at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The plant's roots are used in traditional M\u0101ori medicine for their purported healing properties."
