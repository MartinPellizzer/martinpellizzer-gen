    "intro": "Tingulonga trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leafed euphorbia, is a striking member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces bright yellow cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and vibrant floral structures. However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care."
