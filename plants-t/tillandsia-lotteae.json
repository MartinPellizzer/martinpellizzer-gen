    "intro": "Tillandsia lotteae, commonly known as the Lotte's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to capture moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with a white or pale pink coloration. Tillandsia lotteae is known for its ability to thrive in humid, high-altitude environments with indirect light."
