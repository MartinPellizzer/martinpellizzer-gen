It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem and pinnately compound leaves. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces edible fruits that are consumed by both wildlife and humans. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
