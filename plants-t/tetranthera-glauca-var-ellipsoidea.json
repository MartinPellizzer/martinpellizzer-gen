    "intro": "Tetranthera glauca var. ellipsoidea, commonly known as the elliptic tetranthera, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible roots. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in a waxy, bluish-green coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its small, clustered flowers are typically greenish-white, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. This variant is distinguished by its elliptical leaf shape, which sets it apart from other varieties within the species."
