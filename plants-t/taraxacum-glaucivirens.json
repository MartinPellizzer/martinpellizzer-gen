    "intro": "Taraxacum glaucivirens, commonly known as the blue-veined dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive blue-green coloration on the leaves and its yellow composite flower heads. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, this plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It produces a fluffy seed head that is dispersed by the wind, a common trait among dandelions. The plant is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
