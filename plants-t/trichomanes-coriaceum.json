    "intro": "Trichomanes coriaceum, commonly known as the tough fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and covered with a thick cuticle. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Trichomanes coriaceum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, shaded conditions."
