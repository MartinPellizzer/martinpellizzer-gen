    "intro": "Tephrocactus andicola, commonly known as the Andean rock cactus, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is a small, compact cactus with a globular or cylindrical stem that is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. Tephrocactus andicola is well adapted to cool, high-altitude climates with limited soil and moisture."
