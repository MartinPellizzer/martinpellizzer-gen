    "intro": "Tilia mellita, commonly known as small-leaf lime, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of other lime species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which appear before the leaves in early spring. Its fruit is a small, spherical\u84b4\u679c that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Tilia mellita is often found in moist, fertile soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in landscaping."
