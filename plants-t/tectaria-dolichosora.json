    "intro": "Tectaria dolichosora, commonly known as the long-stalked shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive shield-shaped base. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its host while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the forest canopy."
