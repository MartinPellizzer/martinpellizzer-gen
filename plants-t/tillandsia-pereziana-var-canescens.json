    "intro": "Tillandsia pereziana var. canescens, commonly known as the silver-tipped air plant, is a bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a dense covering of white trichomes, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, often appearing in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to dry, shaded environments and requires minimal care when cultivated."
