It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, which attract various pollinators. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the surrounding substrates. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species in the wild."
