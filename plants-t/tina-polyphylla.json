It is characterized by its velvety foliage and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant typically grows as a low-growing shrub with a compact, bushy form. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy texture. Tina polyphylla thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
