It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, dark green leaves that are narrow and strap-like. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Trichelostylis stricta is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. It is valued for its hardiness and is used in landscaping for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
