    "intro": "Thalictrum cultratum subsp. platycarpum, commonly known as the flat-seeded meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, branched stems that often grow in moist meadows and woodlands. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on long pedicels. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided leaflets that give it a delicate appearance. The subspecies is distinguished by its broader, more flattened fruits compared to other members of the species."
