    "intro": "Tephrosia periculosa, commonly known as the deadly tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is notable for its toxic properties, containing compounds that can be harmful to livestock and humans if ingested. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as savannas and woodland edges. Despite its toxicity, it plays a role in ecological systems by fixing nitrogen in the soil."
