    "intro": "Trymalium bifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southeastern Australia. It grows on the branches of eucalyptus and other host trees, deriving some of its nutrients from the host while performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. Its flowers are white or pale green, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round berries that are often eaten by birds. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food for various wildlife species."
