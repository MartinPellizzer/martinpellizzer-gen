    "intro": "Tmesipteris oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically broad and lance-shaped. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Tmesipteris oblongifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
