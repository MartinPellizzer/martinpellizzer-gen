    "intro": "Tulipa ophiophylla subsp. donetica, commonly known as the Turk's Cap Lily, is a rare and striking member of the tulip family native to Turkey. It is characterized by its large, showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in woodland habitats. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
