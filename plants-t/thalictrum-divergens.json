    "intro": "Thalictrum divergens, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a tall, slender stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with compound leaves that are deeply divided and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate, greenish-white flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its root system consists of a thick, fleshy rhizome that helps it survive in various soil conditions. Thalictrum divergens is often found in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
