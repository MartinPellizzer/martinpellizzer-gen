    "intro": "Timonius polyneurus, commonly known as the purple fringed orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet petals with intricate fringes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive sufficient indirect light. Its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, producing a unique fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
