    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 turgida, commonly known as the hybrid linden, is a deciduous tree that results from the crossbreeding of Tilia cordata and Tilia europaea. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a smooth texture. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in early summer. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Tilia \u00d7 turgida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly planted in urban landscapes for its shade and aesthetic qualities."
