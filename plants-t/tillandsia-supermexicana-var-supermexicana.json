    "intro": "Tillandsia supermexicana var. supermexicana, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
