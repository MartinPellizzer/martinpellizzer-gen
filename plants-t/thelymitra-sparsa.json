    "intro": "Thelymitra sparsa, commonly known as the sparse helmet orchid, is a species of terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, helmet-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces a single, erect spike bearing several small, ovate flowers, which are often adorned with a prominent, hood-like structure. Thelymitra sparsa thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in rainforest or understorey habitats. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects, contributing to its ecological significance in native ecosystems."
