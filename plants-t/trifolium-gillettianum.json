    "intro": "Trifolium gillettianum, commonly known as Gillett's clover, is a flowering plant species native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Gillett's clover is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its use in forage and erosion control."
