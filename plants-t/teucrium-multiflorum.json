    "intro": "Teucrium multiflorum, commonly known as blueweed or tall germander, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry garden environments. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to Mediterranean-style landscapes."
