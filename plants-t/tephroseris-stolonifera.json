    "intro": "Tephroseris stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous tephroseris, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Tephroseris stolonifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
