It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and purple-tinged inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and wetlands. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, with the lower bracts often displaying a striking violet color.
