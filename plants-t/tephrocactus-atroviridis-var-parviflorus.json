    "intro": "Tephrocactus atroviridis var. parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered dark green cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem covered in dense, dark green, rib-like structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often clustered at the stem tips. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
