    "intro": "Trifolium absconditum, commonly known as the hidden clover, is a rare and elusive species of the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring. Native to specific regions of Europe, it thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Due to its rarity and delicate nature, it is often considered a protected species in its native range."
