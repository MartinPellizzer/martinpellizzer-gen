    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudoplatylepium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, tall, hollow stem that bears a large, yellow flower head. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its potential medicinal properties."
