It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
