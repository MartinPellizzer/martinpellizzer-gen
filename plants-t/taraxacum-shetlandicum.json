    "intro": "Taraxacum shetlandicum, commonly known as the Shetland dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Shetland Islands of Scotland. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy stems. The plant produces a distinctive seed head that disperses its seeds via the wind, a common adaptation in the Asteraceae family. It thrives in meadows and grasslands, often in coastal areas, and is adapted to the cool, maritime climate of the Shetland Islands. Taraxacum shetlandicum is a hardy perennial that plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
