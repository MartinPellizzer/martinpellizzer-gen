    "intro": "Tillaea helmsii, commonly known as the Sierra Tillia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are borne in compact inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
