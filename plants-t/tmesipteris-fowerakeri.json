    "intro": "Tmesipteris fowerakeri, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Dicksoniaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting the growth of the upright stem. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow in the dark, which is a unique botanical feature."
