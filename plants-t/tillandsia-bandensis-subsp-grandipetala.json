    "intro": "Tillandsia bandensis subsp. grandipetala, commonly known as the grandipetala air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. Its inflorescence produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity."
