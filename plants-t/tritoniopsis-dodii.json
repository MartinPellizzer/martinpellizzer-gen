    "intro": "Tritoniopsis dodii, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to Tanzania. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces showy, velvety flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, often with a distinctive central spot. Its leaves are thick, fleshy, and typically have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Tritoniopsis dodii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
