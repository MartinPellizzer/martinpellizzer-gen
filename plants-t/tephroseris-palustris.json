    "intro": "Tephroseris palustris, commonly known as the marsh gentian, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and marshes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its wetland environment. Tephroseris palustris plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
