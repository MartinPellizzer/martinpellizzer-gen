    "intro": "Thelypteris littoralis, commonly known as the coastal maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to coastal regions of the eastern United States. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark, a unique characteristic among ferns. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Thelypteris littoralis is an important indicator species for coastal ecosystems and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
