    "intro": "Taraxacum heterophylloides, commonly known as the variable dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that develop into spherical seed heads, each containing numerous wind-dispersed seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The species is noted for its morphological variability, which contributes to its common name."
