    "intro": "Tillandsia cacticola, commonly known as the cactus tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are adapted for water collection. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires minimal soil, relying instead on atmospheric moisture. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, and it produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow or orange. This unique plant is popular among bromeliophiles for its low maintenance and striking appearance."
