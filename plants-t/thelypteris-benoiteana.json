    "intro": "Thelypteris benoiteana, commonly known as the Benoite's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, shield-like shape, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
