    "intro": "Tarennoidea axillaris, commonly known as the rock fig, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded foliage and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. Tarennoidea axillaris is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
