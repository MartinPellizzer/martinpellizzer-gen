    "intro": "Tetratheca nuda, commonly known as the naked tetratheca, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rutaceae. It is native to southeastern Australia, where it typically grows in dry, open habitats such as heathlands and sand dunes. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. It produces small, oval fruits that contain one or two seeds, and it is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tetratheca nuda is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
