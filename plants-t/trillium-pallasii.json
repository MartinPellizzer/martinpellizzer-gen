    "intro": "Trillium pallasii, commonly known as Pallas's trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its three elliptical leaves and a single, showy white or pinkish flower. The plant typically grows in moist, rich forest soils and is often found in shaded, deciduous woodlands. Trillium pallasii has a distinctive underground rhizome system that helps it survive through harsh winter conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
