    "intro": "Thuja pensilis, commonly known as the hanging cedar, is a species of coniferous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its drooping branches that give it a distinctive, cascading appearance. The plant has scale-like leaves that are closely arranged along the stems, contributing to its unique foliage structure. It produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Thuja pensilis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various growing conditions."
