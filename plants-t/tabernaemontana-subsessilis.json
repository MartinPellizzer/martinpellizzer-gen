    "intro": "Tabernaemontana subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved angel's trumpet, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in clusters. The plant has dark green, narrow leaves that are opposite in arrangement, and it produces a milky sap that can be toxic. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, due to its toxicity, it requires careful handling and is not suitable for indoor environments with children or pets."
