    "intro": "Taraxacum frondatum, commonly known as the fronded dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, fields, and disturbed soils. Taraxacum frondatum is a perennial herb that is widely distributed across North America and parts of Europe."
