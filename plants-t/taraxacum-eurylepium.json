    "intro": "Taraxacum eurylepium, commonly known as the European dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk flowers, which mature into the familiar white, fluffy seeds with parachute-like structures. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. This species is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
