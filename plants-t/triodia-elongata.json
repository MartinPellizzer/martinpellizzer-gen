    "intro": "Triodia elongata, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems with small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, providing a protective adaptation against harsh conditions. Triodia elongata is an important component of mallee and spinifex grasslands, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife. Its resilience to drought and grazing makes it a key species in ecological restoration efforts."
