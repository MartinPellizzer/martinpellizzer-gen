    "intro": "Tillandsia coalcomanensis, commonly known as the Coalcomanensis air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
