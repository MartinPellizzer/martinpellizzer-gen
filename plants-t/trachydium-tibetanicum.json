    "intro": "Trachydium tibetanicum, commonly known as the Tibetan trachydium, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to extreme climatic conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss, while its flowers are small and yellow, often arranged in a clustered inflorescence. Trachydium tibetanicum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
