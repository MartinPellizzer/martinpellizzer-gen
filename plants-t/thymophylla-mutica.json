    "intro": "Thymophylla mutica, commonly known as the mossy thyme, is a small, mat-forming plant belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and tiny, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of moss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Thymophylla mutica is often found in temperate regions and is known for its ability to colonize nutrient-poor soils."
