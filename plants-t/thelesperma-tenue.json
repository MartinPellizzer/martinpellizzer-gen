    "intro": "Thelesperma tenue, commonly known as narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, compound leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in spikes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Thelesperma tenue is valued for its drought tolerance and is used in restoration projects to stabilize soils in arid environments."
