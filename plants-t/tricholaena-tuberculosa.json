It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly the Congo Basin, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps or tubercles. Its inflorescences produce small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Tricholaena tuberculosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
