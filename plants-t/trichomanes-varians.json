    "intro": "Trichomanes varians, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on rock faces or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes varians is a small, epiphytic fern that plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
