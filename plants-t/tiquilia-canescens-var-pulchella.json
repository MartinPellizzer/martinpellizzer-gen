    "intro": "Tiquilia canescens var. pulchella, commonly known as the pink tiquilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with slender, often hairy stems that bear small, showy pink or red flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its foliage is typically gray-green, covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
