    "intro": "Tillandsia cochabambae, commonly known as the Cochabamba airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to Bolivia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to grow in high-altitude regions. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
