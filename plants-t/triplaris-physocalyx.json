    "intro": "Triplaris physocalyx, commonly known as the broadleaf sand-privet, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, spherical berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in coastal gardens."
