It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is notable for its finely divided, crenulate leaves that give it a feathery appearance. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its botanical interest lies in its morphological variation and potential ecological roles within its native habitat."
