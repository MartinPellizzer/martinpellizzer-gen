It is characterized by its delicate, bright green fronds with a dense covering of minute, golden-brown scales. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its intricate frond structure consists of numerous small, lance-shaped pinnae arranged in a compact, rosette-like pattern. Trichomanes haenkeanum is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in forested areas, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air."
