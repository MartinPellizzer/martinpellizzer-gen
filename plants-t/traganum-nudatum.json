    "intro": "Traganum nudatum, commonly known as the desert grass or sand grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a perennial grass that grows in dense, low mats, often forming a dense cover on sandy or rocky soils. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed or barren areas effectively. Traganum nudatum is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low water availability, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
