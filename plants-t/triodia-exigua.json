    "intro": "Triodia exigua, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tussock-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Triodia exigua plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife. It is also known for its resilience to drought and grazing."
