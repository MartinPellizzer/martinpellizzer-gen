    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. vulpinum, commonly known as the common wheat, is a variant of wheat native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, parallel-veined leaves. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-lobed florets that contain both male and female reproductive structures. Its seeds, which are the primary product, are encased in a hull and are used extensively in bread-making and other food products. The plant is also valued for its adaptability to various soil types and its role in agricultural ecosystems."
