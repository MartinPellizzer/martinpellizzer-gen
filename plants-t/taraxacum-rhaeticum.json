    "intro": "Taraxacum rhaeticum, commonly known as the Alpine dandelion, is a perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, hairy, silver-green leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy white pappus, aiding in wind pollination and seed dispersal. It thrives in rocky and meadow habitats at high altitudes. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
