    "intro": "Trichonema cruciatum, commonly known as the cruciate trichonema, is a small, annual herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive cross-shaped arrangement of veins, giving it its scientific name. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Trichonema cruciatum is often found in nutrient-rich soils and is relatively uncommon in the wild."
