    "intro": "Thesium linophyllon var. minus, commonly known as the lesser thesium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, pale green to yellowish leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
