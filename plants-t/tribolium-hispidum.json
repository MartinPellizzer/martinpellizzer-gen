    "intro": "Tribolium hispidum, commonly known as the hairy weevil, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Curculionidae. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped body covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant it is associated with, likely a flowering plant, serves as both a host and a food source for the beetle's larvae. Tribolium hispidum is often found in agricultural settings where its host plants are cultivated. Its life cycle involves several stages, including egg, larva, pupa, and adult, with the larvae primarily feeding on the host plant's seeds or leaves."
