    "intro": "Triticum sativum var. capense, commonly known as Cape wheat, is a lesser-known variety of wheat native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, hard grains that are typically used for animal feed rather than human consumption. The plant has a short life cycle, maturing within a few months under suitable climatic conditions. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a dense, spike-like inflorescence. Due to its adaptability to arid environments, it has been studied for potential use in drought-resistant agriculture."
