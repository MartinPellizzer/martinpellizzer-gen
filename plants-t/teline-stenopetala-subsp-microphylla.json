It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and delicate, pale blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
