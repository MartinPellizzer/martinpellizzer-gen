    "intro": "Tillandsia chaetophylla, commonly known as the hairy leaf airplant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help in water absorption. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Tillandsia chaetophylla is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in various conditions."
