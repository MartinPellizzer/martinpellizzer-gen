    "intro": "Tylloma pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf tylloma, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. Its flowers are usually pale blue or white, with four petals, and bloom in early spring. Tylloma pusillum is often used in rock gardens due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
