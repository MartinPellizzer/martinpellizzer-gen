    "intro": "Thymus membranaceus, commonly known as Chinese thyme, is a perennial herb native to China and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, woody stems and small, aromatic leaves. The plant produces pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The leaves are often used in traditional Chinese medicine and as a culinary herb due to their pungent, slightly spicy flavor."
