    "intro": "Terpsichore reclinata, commonly known as the reclining dancer's flower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the cloud forests of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, drooping stems and clusters of small, pale blue flowers that bloom in the early spring. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that help it thrive in the shaded, moist environments it prefers. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and requires high humidity and indirect light to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
