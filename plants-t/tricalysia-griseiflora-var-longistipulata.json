    "intro": "Tricalysia griseiflora var. longistipulata, commonly known as the long-stipuled gray-flowered tricalysia, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its elongated, slender leaves with prominent stipules, which are leaf-like structures at the base of the leaf stalk. The plant produces small, pale green to grayish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a faintly fragrant scent. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
