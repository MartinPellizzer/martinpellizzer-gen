    "intro": "Thlaspi rotundifolium f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered rockcress, is a variant of the rockcress species characterized by its pale or white flowers. It is a low-growing perennial plant that typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. The leaves are rounded and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This plant is native to regions of Europe and parts of Asia, where it often grows in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
