    "intro": "Thrixspermum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves and showy, often pink or purple flowers. These plants are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Thrixspermum species are annual or perennial herbs that can become invasive in certain environments. Their botanical features make them important in both ecological studies and horticultural applications."
