    "intro": "Triticum repens subvar. dumetorum, commonly known as velvet fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is used in landscaping and as a forage crop in some regions."
