    "intro": "Trillium foetidissimum, commonly known as the stinking Benjamin, is a rare and striking North American woodland plant. It features three broad, waxy leaves and a showy, three-petaled white or pinkish flower that blooms in early spring. The plant is notable for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is thought to attract pollinators like flies. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the eastern United States. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
