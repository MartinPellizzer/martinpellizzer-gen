    "intro": "Thelypteris producta, commonly known as the common shield fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds, which are divided into small, linear segments that give the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to the substrate. Thelypteris producta is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
