It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales, which help in water retention. Thelypteris darainensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
