    "intro": "Tetraphyllum confertiflorum, commonly known as the denseflower tetraphyllum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Tetraphylleaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually broad and slightly lobed, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
