    "intro": "Telis arabica, commonly known as the Arabica coffee plant, is a species of shrub native to the highlands of Ethiopia and Sudan. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are oval-shaped and dark green in color. The plant produces small white flowers that develop into red berries containing two seeds, which are used to make coffee. It thrives in tropical climates with high altitudes and consistent rainfall. Due to its delicate nature, it requires careful cultivation to ensure optimal growth and quality of the beans."
