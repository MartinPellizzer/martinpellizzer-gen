It features small, aromatic leaves and pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, are used in aromatherapy and traditional medicine. This subspecies is closely related to common thyme but is distinguished by its unique floral structure and regional distribution."
