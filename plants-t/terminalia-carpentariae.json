    "intro": "Terminalia carpentariae, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and forest edges. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for timber and traditional uses."
