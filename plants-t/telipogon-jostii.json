    "intro": "Telipogon jostii, commonly known as the Jost's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin soil layers of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Telipogon jostii is considered a vulnerable species."
