It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many grass-like plants adapted to arid and coastal environments. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
