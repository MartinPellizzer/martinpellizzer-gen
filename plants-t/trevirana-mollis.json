    "intro": "Trevirana mollis, commonly known as the soft-tongued lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale to yellowish-green thallus with a smooth, leathery texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or rocks in temperate regions. Trevirana mollis is noted for its slow growth and is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and environmental changes."
