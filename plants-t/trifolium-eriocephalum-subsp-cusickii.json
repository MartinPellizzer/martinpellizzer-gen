    "intro": "Trifolium eriocephalum subsp. cusickii, commonly known as the Cusick's clover, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense, spherical heads, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
