    "intro": "Tectaria acrocarpa, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Tectaria acrocarpa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
