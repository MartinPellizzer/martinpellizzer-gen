    "intro": "Thelypteris moseleyi, commonly known as the Moseley's water fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. Thelypteris moseleyi plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
