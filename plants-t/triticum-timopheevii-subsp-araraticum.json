    "intro": "Triticum timopheevii subsp. araraticum, commonly known as the Armenian wild wheat, is a wild relative of cultivated wheat that exhibits a range of botanical characteristics. It is a diploid species with a genome size smaller than that of common wheat, contributing to its genetic diversity. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and has a slender, grass-like structure with narrow leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear small, two-lobed flowers. This subspecies is of interest to researchers due to its potential for improving wheat resilience to environmental stress."
