    "intro": "Tetraena hamiensis var. mandavillei, commonly known as the Hami Desert tetraena, is a shrub native to the arid regions of northwestern China. It is characterized by its small, woody stems and grayish-green, leathery leaves adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat."
