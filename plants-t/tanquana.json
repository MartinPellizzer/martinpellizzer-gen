    "intro": "Tanquana, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, twisted branches and clusters of fragrant, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in the spring. The leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid landscapes."
