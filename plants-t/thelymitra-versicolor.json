    "intro": "Thelymitra versicolor, commonly known as the variable sun-orchid, is a species of orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its strikingly variable flower colors, which can range from white to pink, red, and even purple, depending on the individual plant. The plant typically grows in open forest or woodland habitats, often in sandy or loamy soils. Its flowers are resupinate, meaning they are twisted 180 degrees, a common feature in many orchid species. Thelymitra versicolor is also known for its ability to form dense clumps, making it a desirable plant for ornamental gardening."
