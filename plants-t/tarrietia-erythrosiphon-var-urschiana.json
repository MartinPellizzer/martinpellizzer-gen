    "intro": "Tarrietia erythrosiphon var. urschiana, commonly known as the red-stemmed tarrietia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color, which distinguish it from other varieties of the species. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface that aids in moisture retention. This variant is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded forest environments."
