    "intro": "Townsendia alpigena, commonly known as the alpine townsendia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb with slender stems and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs that help reduce water loss. The species is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high elevations, where it plays a role in alpine ecosystems."
