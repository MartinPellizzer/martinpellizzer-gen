    "intro": "Torrubia insularis, commonly known as the Canary Island heath, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries. The plant is characterized by its low-growing shrub form, with small, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
