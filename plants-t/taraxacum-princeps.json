    "intro": "Taraxacum princeps, commonly known as the royal dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow ray flowers and a distinctive, hollow, leafy stem. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette, and the plant produces a hairy, elongated seed head that disperses its seeds via the wind. It is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
