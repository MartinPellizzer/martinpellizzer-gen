    "intro": "Tetragonia robusta, commonly known as sea beet, is a halophytic plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, enabling it to thrive in saline and arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional cuisine, while the plant also serves as a source of bioactive compounds. Tetragonia robusta exhibits a robust growth habit with a sprawling or upright form, depending on environmental conditions."
