    "intro": "Thelypteris prolifera, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively. The plant features lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures include sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
