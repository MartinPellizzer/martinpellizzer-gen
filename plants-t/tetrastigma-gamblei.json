It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its tendrils that allow it to climb and spread across surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by clusters of round, edible berries that resemble raisins. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a smooth texture and a slightly glossy appearance. Tetrastigma gamblei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
