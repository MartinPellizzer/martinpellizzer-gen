    "intro": "Tupistra japonica, commonly known as Japanese stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to Japan. It features dense clusters of fleshy, oval leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky or gravelly soils and requires minimal water once established. Tupistra japonica is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
