    "intro": "Tubella foliata, commonly known as the leafy tubella, is a species of sea anemone found in marine environments. It is characterized by its delicate, branching structure and translucent, tubular polyps. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a central axis covered in leaf-like structures, which are actually specialized tentacles. These tentacles are used for capturing prey and are highly sensitive to water movement. Tubella foliata plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the biodiversity of coral reefs and other underwater habitats."
