    "intro": "Taraxacum marginellum, commonly known as the narrowleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a capsule-like fruit that releases seeds with feathery parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Taraxacum marginellum is a perennial herb that thrives in temperate climates and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
