    "intro": "Taxillus levinei, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rubiaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using sunlight. The plant forms a dense, bushy growth that can cover large areas of the host's canopy. Its small, white or pink flowers are followed by berries that are dispersed by birds. Taxillus levinei plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife species."
