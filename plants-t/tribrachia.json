    "intro": "Tribrachia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline and sandy environments. They are characterized by their spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the flower heads, giving them a distinctive appearance. The flowers themselves are small and clustered, often in a radiate pattern. Tribrachia species are valued for their ornamental qualities and are sometimes cultivated in gardens with saline soil conditions."
