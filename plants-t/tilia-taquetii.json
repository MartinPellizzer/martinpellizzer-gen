    "intro": "Tilia taquetii, commonly known as the Taquet's lime, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, round fruits. It typically grows to a height of 10-15 meters and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
