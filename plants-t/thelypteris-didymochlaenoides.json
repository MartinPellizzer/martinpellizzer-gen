    "intro": "Thelypteris didymochlaenoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its slender, arching fronds with a dark green, glossy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Thelypteris didymochlaenoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like foliage."
