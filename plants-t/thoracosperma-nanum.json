    "intro": "Thoracosperma nanum, commonly known as the dwarf mangrove, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in catkin-like inflorescences, followed by woody fruits containing single seeds. It thrives in coastal areas and brackish water environments, exhibiting adaptations such as pneumatophores for gas exchange. Its ecological role includes stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
