    "intro": "Tetraria stagnalis, commonly known as the water starwort, is a small aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves and produces small, inconspicuous fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Tetraria stagnalis is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to aquatic life, with specialized tissues for buoyancy and gas exchange."
