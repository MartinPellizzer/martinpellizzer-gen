    "intro": "Triaspis mozambica f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender triaspis, is a rare and delicate fern native to southern Africa. It features finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are characterized by their slender, elongated shape and a soft, feathery texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
