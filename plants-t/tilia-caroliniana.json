    "intro": "Tilia caroliniana, commonly known as the American basswood, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The tree produces small, round fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The American basswood is valued for its lightweight wood and its role in supporting local wildlife."
