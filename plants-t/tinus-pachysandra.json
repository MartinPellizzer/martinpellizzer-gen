    "intro": "Tinus pachysandra, commonly known as Japanese spurge, is a low-growing evergreen groundcover plant native to East Asia. It features dense, glossy, dark green foliage with small, rounded leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers in late spring, which are followed by red berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and is highly tolerant of various soil types. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in natural areas."
