It is characterized by its fragrant, star-shaped white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has pubescent (hairy) stems and leaves, which give it its varietal name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in ornamental landscaping. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for covering trellises, fences, or walls."
