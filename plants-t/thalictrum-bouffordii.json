    "intro": "Thalictrum bouffordii, commonly known as the mountain meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply divided and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers in early summer, which are arranged in compound umbels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
