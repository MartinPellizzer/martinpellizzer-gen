It features aromatic, gray-green foliage with fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary uses, though it is less commonly cultivated than other thyme species."
