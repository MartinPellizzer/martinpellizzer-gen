    "intro": "Taraxacum turgidum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flower head composed of numerous yellow ray florets. The plant produces a distinctive seed head, known as a pappus, which consists of feathery bristles that aid in wind dispersal. It is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings. Taraxacum turgidum is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
