    "intro": "Trapa bispinosa var. makinoa, commonly known as the Japanese water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to East Asia. It features submerged leaves with distinctive two-spined structures, which are adaptations for its aquatic environment. The plant produces floating fruits that resemble small, spiky nuts, which aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in ponds and marshes. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
