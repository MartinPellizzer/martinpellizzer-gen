    "intro": "Typhalaea fruticosa, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features woody stems covered in dense, grayish-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the dry season, which are adapted for pollination by wind and insects. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Typhalaea fruticosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
