    "intro": "Tilia beaumontii var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping lime, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that create a weeping appearance, making it a popular ornamental plant. The leaves are heart-shaped, serrated, and turn yellow in autumn, adding to its seasonal appeal. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. This variety thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
