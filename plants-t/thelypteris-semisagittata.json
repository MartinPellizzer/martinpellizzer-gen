    "intro": "Thelypteris semisagittata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its dimorphic fronds, with the sterile fronds typically being narrower and more elongated than the fertile ones. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the dry season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Thelypteris semisagittata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
