    "intro": "Tinnea filipes, commonly known as the slender leaf tamarind, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical or lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Tinnea filipes is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in semi-arid conditions. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various ecological niches, though it is not widely cultivated for commercial purposes."
