    "intro": "Trifolium rectiusculum, commonly known as narrow-leafed clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Trifolium rectiusculum is a hardy perennial that plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
