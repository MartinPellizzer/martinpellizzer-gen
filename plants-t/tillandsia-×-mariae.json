    "intro": "Tillandsia \u00d7 mariae, commonly known as the hybrid air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a epiphytic plant that absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through its roots. The plant is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, tropical environments. Its rosette-shaped structure holds water in its central cup, which is used for both hydration and reproduction. Tillandsia \u00d7 mariae is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
