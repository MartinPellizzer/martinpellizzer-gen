    "intro": "Triodia avenacea var. longearistata, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is often found in sandy soils and is an important component of the vegetation in coastal and inland dunes."
