    "intro": "Tapiphyllum verticillatum, commonly known as the whorled tapiphyllum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
