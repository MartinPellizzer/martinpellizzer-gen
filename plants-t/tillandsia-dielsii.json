    "intro": "Tillandsia dielsii, commonly known as the Diels' air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. It produces small, white flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia dielsii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
