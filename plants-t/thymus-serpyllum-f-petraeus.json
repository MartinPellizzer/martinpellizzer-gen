    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. petraeus, commonly known as the alpine thyme, is a subspecies of thyme native to rocky and alpine environments. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, fragrant leaves that are often used in cooking and traditional medicine. The plant produces tiny, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its aromatic properties are due to the presence of essential oils, particularly thymol and carvacrol. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh conditions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
