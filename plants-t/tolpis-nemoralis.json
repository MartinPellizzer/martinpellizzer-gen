    "intro": "Tolpis nemoralis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed tolpis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, producing pale blue or purple petals. Tolpis nemoralis is adapted to dry conditions and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
