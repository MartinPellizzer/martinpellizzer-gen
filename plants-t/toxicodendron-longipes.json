    "intro": "Toxicodendron longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to parts of Central and South America. It is a climbing shrub that can grow up to several meters in height, often using its aerial roots to ascend trees. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and is known for its toxic sap, which contains urushiol, a potent allergen that can cause severe skin irritation. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by both humans and animals, though some insects and birds may feed on its foliage."
