    "intro": "Thrincia hirta var. arenaria, commonly known as sand couch grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. It is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it common in coastal dunes. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sand dunes, contributing to coastal erosion control."
