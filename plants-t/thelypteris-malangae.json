    "intro": "Thelypteris malangae, commonly known as the Malang fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris malangae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
