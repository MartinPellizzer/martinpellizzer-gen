    "intro": "Tectaria lobulata, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which give it its common name, and it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it recognizable in its native habitat. Tectaria lobulata is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, forested areas."
