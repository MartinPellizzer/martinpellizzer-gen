The plant produces showy, upright clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a valuable addition to woodland gardens. Its botanical structure supports a variety of pollinators, contributing to ecological diversity in its habitat."
