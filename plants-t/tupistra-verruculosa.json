    "intro": "Tupistra verruculosa, commonly known as the woolly yew, is a slow-growing, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive, fleshy, yellowish-brown berries that mature in late summer. The plant has scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, giving it a rounded appearance, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and hardiness."
