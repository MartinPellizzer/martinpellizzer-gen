    "intro": "Thelypteris endorica, commonly known as the Endorica water fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as streams and marshes. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, spongy layer that aids in water retention. Thelypteris endorica plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
