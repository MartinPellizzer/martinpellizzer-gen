    "intro": "Tacitus, commonly known as the yellow wood or the tree of heaven, is a species of flowering plant in the genus *Ailanthus*. It is native to China but has been introduced to various parts of the world, including North America. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive silvery underside. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in urban environments, it is often considered an invasive species in many regions."
