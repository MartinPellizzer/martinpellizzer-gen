    "intro": "Thelypteris decursive-pinnata, commonly known as the running fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, spreading growth habit. It features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a decurrent pinnate structure that gives it its specific epithet. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate and tropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and enable it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. The leaves are usually leathery and have a bright green color, which helps in photosynthesis in low-light conditions."
