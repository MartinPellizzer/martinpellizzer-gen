It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its long, trailing stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its scale-like leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in tropical and subtropical regions. Its appearance resembles a hanging curtain of green filaments, making it a popular ornamental plant."
