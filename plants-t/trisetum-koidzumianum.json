    "intro": "Trisetum koidzumianum, commonly known as the Koidzumi's wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. It produces small, clustered flowers that are often inconspicuous, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively. Trisetum koidzumianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
