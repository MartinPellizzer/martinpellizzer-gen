    "intro": "Tenaris rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common trait among species in its family. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a hairy texture, and it thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Tenaris rostrata is also known for its role in supporting local pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
