    "intro": "Tricholepis lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage and spiny, spherical flower heads that appear in late summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine. Its thick, woolly leaves help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid environments. Tricholepis lanuginosa is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
