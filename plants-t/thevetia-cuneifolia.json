It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its bright yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are a concern for both humans and animals. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture. Thevetia cuneifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value but requires careful handling due to its poisonous properties."
