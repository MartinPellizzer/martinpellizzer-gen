    "intro": "Thalassodendron leptocaule, commonly known as the slender-stemmed sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and red. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments, making it well adapted to coastal habitats. Its leaves are usually opposite and elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Thalassodendron leptocaule plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial organisms."
