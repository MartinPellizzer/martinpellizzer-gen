    "intro": "Triticum durum f. tristeboeufii, commonly known as the tristeboeufii form of durum wheat, is a botanical variant characterized by its unique morphological features. It exhibits a distinct growth habit compared to standard durum wheat, often showing reduced plant height and altered spike morphology. The plant possesses a compact inflorescence with shorter rachis segments and fewer spikelets, which are typically more densely arranged. Its leaves are usually narrower and more erect, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This form is of interest in botanical studies due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to specific environmental conditions."
