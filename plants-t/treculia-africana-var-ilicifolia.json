    "intro": "Treculia africana var. ilicifolia, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its thick, lobed leaves and smooth, pale bark. The tree produces a large, round fruit with a hard, woody shell enclosing a fatty, edible kernel. The kernel is the primary source of shea butter, which is widely used in cosmetics and food products. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forested areas across West and Central Africa."
