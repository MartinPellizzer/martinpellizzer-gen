    "intro": "Trifolium parvulum, commonly known as the small clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stalk. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in early spring. Trifolium parvulum is a low-growing perennial that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows and disturbed soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
