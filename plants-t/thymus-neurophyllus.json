    "intro": "Thymus neurophyllus, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features aromatic, narrow, gray-green leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils contain thymol, which contributes to its medicinal and culinary uses."
