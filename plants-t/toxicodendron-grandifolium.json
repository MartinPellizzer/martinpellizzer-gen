    "intro": "Toxicodendron grandifolium, commonly known as the itchleaf or sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically composed of 5 to 11 oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fuzzy berries. It contains urushiol, a potent irritant that can cause severe skin reactions in humans. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided or handled with care."
