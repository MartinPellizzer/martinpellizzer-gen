    "intro": "Tillandsia machupicchuensis, commonly known as the Machu Picchu airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean highlands of Peru. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. This species thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal."
