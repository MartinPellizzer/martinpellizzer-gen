    "intro": "Trifolium arenivagum, commonly known as the sand clover, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow or white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the spring and summer seasons. Trifolium arenivagum is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in environments with low moisture availability. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant for soil enrichment in degraded landscapes."
