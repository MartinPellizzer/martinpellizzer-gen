    "intro": "Thelypteris correllii, commonly known as the Correll's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. Thelypteris correllii thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners interested in native plant species."
