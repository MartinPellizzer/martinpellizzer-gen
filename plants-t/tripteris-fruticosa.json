It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, tropical environments, often found in the understory of rainforests. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in inflorescences. It produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. Tripteris fruticosa is known for its stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact with the skin."
