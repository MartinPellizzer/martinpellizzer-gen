    "intro": "Tragacantha paralurges, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that produces a valuable resin, often used in traditional medicine and as a natural gum substitute. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Its leaves are typically small and grayish-green, and it produces yellow flowers in the spring. The bark is thick and fissured, providing some protection against extreme temperatures and grazing animals."
