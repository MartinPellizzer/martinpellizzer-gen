    "intro": "Telipogon zephyrinus, commonly known as the windgrass, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
