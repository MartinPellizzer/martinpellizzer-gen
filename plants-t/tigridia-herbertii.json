    "intro": "Tigridia herbertii, commonly known as Herbert's tiger flower, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that resemble those of the tiger lily. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tall, branched stems that bear clusters of bright orange or red blooms. Tigridia herbertii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to drought conditions, requiring minimal water once established."
