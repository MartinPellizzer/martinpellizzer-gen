    "intro": "Trifolium pratense var. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy red clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and have a pale green to bluish-green color. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense spherical clusters, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage crop."
