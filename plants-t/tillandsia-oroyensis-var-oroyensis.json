    "intro": "Tillandsia oroyensis var. oroyensis, commonly known as the Oroya air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean region of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to capture and store water. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of white or pale purple. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, humid conditions and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
