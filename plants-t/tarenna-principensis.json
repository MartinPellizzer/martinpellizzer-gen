    "intro": "Tarenna principensis, commonly known as the Madagascan tarenna, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its small, elliptic leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats within montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tarenna principensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
