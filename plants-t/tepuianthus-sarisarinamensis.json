    "intro": "Tepuianthus sarisarinamensis, commonly known as the Sarisarinamensis Tepuianthus, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the tepuis of Venezuela. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in the unique microclimates of the high-altitude grasslands found on these isolated tabletop mountains. Its growth is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils and strong sunlight of the region. Due to its restricted habitat and limited genetic diversity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
