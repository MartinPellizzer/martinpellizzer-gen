    "intro": "Typha latifolia var. gracilis, commonly known as narrowleaf cattail, is a wetland plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, cylindrical flower head. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant produces a distinctive brown, mat-like structure called a \"cattail\" that contains numerous small, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife. Its botanical features make it a key indicator species for wetland health and water quality."
