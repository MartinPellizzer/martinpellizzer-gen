    "intro": "Thelypteris nigrescentia, commonly known as the blackening shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that turn a deep black or dark purple when dry. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in humid conditions. The fronds are pinnate, with a distinctive, shield-shaped outline that gives the plant its common name."
