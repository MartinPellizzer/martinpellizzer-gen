    "intro": "Trifolium maritimum, commonly known as sea trefoil, is a flowering plant species native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in salty, sandy, or rocky soils along shorelines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects. Trifolium maritimum is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions."
