    "intro": "Thymus subcitratus, commonly known as lemon thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean. It features small, aromatic leaves that emit a distinct lemony scent, which is due to the presence of thymol and other volatile oils. The plant produces tiny pink or purple flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its medicinal and culinary uses are largely derived from its essential oils, which have antimicrobial properties."
