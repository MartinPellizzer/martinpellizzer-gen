    "intro": "Trichanthecium parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaf trichanthecium, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or wetlands. Its small, narrow leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that develop into small, dry fruits. Trichanthecium parvifolium is often found in areas with high humidity and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-rich soils."
