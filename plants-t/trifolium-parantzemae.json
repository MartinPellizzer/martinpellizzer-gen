    "intro": "Trifolium parantzemae, commonly known as the Parantzeme's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to specific regions in southern Europe, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and sunny to partially shaded environments. It is often found in grassy areas and along the edges of woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Trifolium parantzemae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
