    "intro": "Trichilia subsessilifolia, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in axillary or terminal panicles, while the fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds. The plant is valued for its durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, and it also has traditional medicinal uses. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks."
