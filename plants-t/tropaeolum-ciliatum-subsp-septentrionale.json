    "intro": "Tropaeolum ciliatum subsp. septentrionale, commonly known as the northern leafy sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense ground cover. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and edible leaves."
