    "intro": "Tillandsia naundorffiae, commonly known as the Naundorf's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, fibrous roots and produces rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to absorb moisture from the air. Its unique structure allows it to survive in a variety of ecological niches, including tree canopies and rocky outcrops."
