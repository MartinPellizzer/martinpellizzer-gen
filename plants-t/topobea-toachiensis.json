It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, adapting to the harsh conditions of its environment. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and yellow, often clustered together. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
