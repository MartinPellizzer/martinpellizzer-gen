    "intro": "Tetragonolobus aegaeus, commonly known as the Ethiopian vetch, is a leguminous plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its quadrangular stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by lens-shaped pods containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often used as a forage crop for livestock. Due to its drought tolerance and nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays an important role in soil enrichment and sustainable agriculture."
