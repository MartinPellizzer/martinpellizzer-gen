    "intro": "Triticum vulgarioides, commonly known as the wild wheat or false wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are small and oval, often dispersed by wind or water. Triticum vulgarioides is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop but is more commonly found in wild habitats."
