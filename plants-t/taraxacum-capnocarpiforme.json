    "intro": "Taraxacum capnocarpiforme, commonly known as the capnocarpiform dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and a distinctive, hollow, hairless stem. The plant produces a single, elongated, and often curved seed head, which is a unique feature compared to other dandelion species. It typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its environment, supporting its role in pollination and seed dispersal."
