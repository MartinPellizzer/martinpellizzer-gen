    "intro": "Tradescantia subacaulis, commonly known as the spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of three-petaled flowers in shades of purple, pink, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Tradescantia subacaulis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense ground cover."
