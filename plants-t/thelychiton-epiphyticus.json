    "intro": "Thelychiton epiphyticus, commonly known as the epiphytic orchid, is a rare and specialized plant that grows on the surface of other plants, typically in tropical or subtropical regions. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its aerial roots and ability to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant has slender, often clustered stems and produces small, delicate flowers that are usually white or pale in color. Its epiphytic nature allows it to thrive in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its natural range."
