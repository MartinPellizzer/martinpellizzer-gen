    "intro": "Tillandsia engleriana, commonly known as the Engler's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with showy, bell-shaped flowers that can range in color from white to pink. Tillandsia engleriana is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
