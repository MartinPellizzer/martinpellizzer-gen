    "intro": "Tieghemella heckelii, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to western and central Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval, woody fruits containing single seeds. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species."
