    "intro": "Triticum ovatum var. triaristatum, commonly known as the three-rowed wheat, is a rare and ancient variety of wheat characterized by its unique triaristate spikelet structure. This plant is native to the Mediterranean region and is notable for its historical significance in early agricultural practices. It possesses a compact, cylindrical spike with three rows of grains, distinguishing it from common wheat varieties. The botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a robust root system that aids in nutrient absorption. Due to its genetic uniqueness, it is of interest to researchers studying ancient crop domestication and biodiversity."
