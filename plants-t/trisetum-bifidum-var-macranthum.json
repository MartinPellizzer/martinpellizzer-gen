    "intro": "Trisetum bifidum var. macranthum, commonly known as the broad-flowered basket grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, two-lobed spikelets that give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, greenish to brownish flowers in late summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
