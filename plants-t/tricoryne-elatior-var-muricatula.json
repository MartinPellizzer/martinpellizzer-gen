    "intro": "Tricoryne elatior var. muricatula, commonly known as the roughleaf mallow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, and its leaves are ovate with a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces showy, pale pink to lavender flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its hairy stems and leaves provide a distinctive appearance, while its fibrous roots make it somewhat drought-tolerant. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens."
