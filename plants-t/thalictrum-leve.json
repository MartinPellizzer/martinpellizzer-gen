    "intro": "Thalictrum leve, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces clusters of small, usually white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its leaves are compound, with numerous narrow leaflets that give it a lacy appearance. Thalictrum leve is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
