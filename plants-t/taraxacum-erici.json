    "intro": "Taraxacum erici, commonly known as the ericaceous dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that blooms in early summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils, often found in heathland and woodland edges. The plant produces a long, slender stem topped with a single flower, which develops into a distinctive seed head with parachute-like seeds. It is a hardy perennial that plays a role in supporting local insect populations and soil stabilization."
