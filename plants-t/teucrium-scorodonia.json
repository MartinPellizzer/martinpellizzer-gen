    "intro": "Teucrium scorodonia, commonly known as the scorzonera or the Greek woundwort, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly hairy leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and can be quite deep, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Teucrium scorodonia is often found in rocky or dry habitats, and it has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
