It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and swampy areas. The plant's rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, reflecting its ecological and cultural significance."
