    "intro": "Tripterospermum nigrobaccatum, commonly known as the black-barked tripterospermum, is a woody plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark, which gives it its common name. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy fruits. Tripterospermum nigrobaccatum is often found in rocky or coastal habitats and is valued for its ornamental bark and hardiness."
