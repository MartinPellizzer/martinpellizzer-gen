    "intro": "Thelypteris valinorica, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or along streams. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Thelypteris valinorica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
