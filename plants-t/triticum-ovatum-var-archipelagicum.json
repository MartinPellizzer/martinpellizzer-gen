    "intro": "Triticum ovatum var. archipelagicum, commonly known as the island wheat, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the wheat species. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains. This variety is native to the Pacific Islands and thrives in coastal and volcanic soils. Its botanical features include narrow leaves with a bluish-green hue and a unique flowering pattern that occurs during the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native habitat."
