    "intro": "Tragacantha hermonea, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Iran and the Middle East. It is characterized by its thorny branches and small, pale green leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry climates. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of its distinctive resinous pods. The sap, known as gum tragacanth, is harvested and used in various industrial and medicinal applications. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
