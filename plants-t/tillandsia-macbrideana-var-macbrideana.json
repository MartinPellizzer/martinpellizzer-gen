    "intro": "Tillandsia macbrideana var. macbrideana, commonly known as the MacBride's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
