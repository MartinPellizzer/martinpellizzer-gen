    "intro": "Thelypteris invisa, commonly known as the invisible fern, is a species of polypod fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that often appear as a dense, fuzzy mass. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of rhizome scales, which contribute to its unique appearance. Thelypteris invisa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
