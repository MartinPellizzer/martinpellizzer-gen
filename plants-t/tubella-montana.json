    "intro": "Tubella montana, commonly known as the mountain tubella, is a rare and delicate species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the short summer season. Tubella montana is adapted to cold, rocky environments and requires well-drained soil and full sun exposure to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
