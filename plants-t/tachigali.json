    "intro": "Tachigali, commonly known as the \"yellowwood\" or \"tachigali tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its deciduous nature and distinctive yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, with compound leaves and pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Tachigali species are often found in moist, shaded environments and are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. Some species are also used in traditional medicine and as sources of timber."
