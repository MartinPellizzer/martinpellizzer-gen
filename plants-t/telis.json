    "intro": "Telis, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, and it bears smooth, pale green fruits that contain a single seed. Telis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its adaptability to arid conditions makes it a resilient plant in dry environments."
