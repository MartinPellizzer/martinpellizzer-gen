    "intro": "Trematolobelia macrostachys var. kaalae, commonly known as the Kala\u02bb\u0101 fern, is a rare endemic species found exclusively on the island of O\u02bbahu in Hawaii. It is a member of the fern family, characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that grow in a compact, rosette-like formation. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically along stream banks and in rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
