    "intro": "Trifolium constantinopolitanum var. carmelii, commonly known as the Carmel clover, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, often in areas with high salinity and coastal winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
