    "intro": "Thalictrum angustissimum, commonly known as narrowleaf meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in loose, upright inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Thalictrum angustissimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators and other wildlife."
