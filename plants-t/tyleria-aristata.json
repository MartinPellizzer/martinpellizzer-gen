    "intro": "Tyleria aristata, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in subalpine and alpine environments. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive, spiny appearance, while its fruits are small, fleshy berries. Tyleria aristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
