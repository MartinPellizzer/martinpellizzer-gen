    "intro": "Telipogon roberti, commonly known as the Robert's grass, is a rare and small flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive. Its botanical study contributes to understanding the ecological dynamics of alpine ecosystems."
