    "intro": "Thalictrum subrotundatum, commonly known as the round-leaved meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically rounded or elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and wetland restoration projects."
