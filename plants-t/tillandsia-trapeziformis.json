    "intro": "Tillandsia trapeziformis, commonly known as the trapezoid air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant does not require soil to grow and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. It produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia trapeziformis is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its ability to thrive in indirect light and minimal watering."
