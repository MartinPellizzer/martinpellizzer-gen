    "intro": "Thymus numidicus var. micranthus, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces compact clusters of pink or purple flowers, which bloom in early summer. Its foliage is widely used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its pungent, minty aroma. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and dry, sunny environments."
