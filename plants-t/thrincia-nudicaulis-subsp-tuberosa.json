    "intro": "Thrincia nudicaulis subsp. tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous thrincia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, tuberous roots that store nutrients. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, typically in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
