    "intro": "Tradescantia levigata, commonly known as silver sword or snake plant, is a succulent perennial plant native to Central America. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color with a silvery sheen, which helps it store water and adapt to arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers on slender stalks during the growing season. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in low light conditions. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage rather than its flowers."
