    "intro": "Trapa natans f. suecica, commonly known as the European water shield, is a rare aquatic plant characterized by its floating, shield-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers. It is native to freshwater habitats in Europe and is typically found in still or slow-moving waters. The plant has a submerged root system that anchors it in the sediment, while its leaves provide a surface for photosynthesis. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, hard seeds that can remain viable in the water for extended periods. Due to habitat loss and pollution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
