    "intro": "Tylecodon mallei, commonly known as the sticky bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is commonly referred to as the ice plant family. The plant is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems that are covered in a powdery, white coating, giving it a unique appearance. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Tylecodon mallei produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and beetles."
