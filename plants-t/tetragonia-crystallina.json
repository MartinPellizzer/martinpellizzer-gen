    "intro": "Tetragonia crystallina, commonly known as the crystalline purslane, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are edible and have a slightly tangy flavor, making it a useful plant in survival situations. Tetragonia crystallina is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in poor soils and high sunlight conditions."
