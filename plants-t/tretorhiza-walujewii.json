    "intro": "Tretorhiza walujewii, commonly known as the Walujewii orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or among moss-covered rocks. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that are adapted to conserve moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tretorhiza walujewii is considered a species of conservation concern."
