It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. The plant features a robust, fleshy root system that contributes to its resilience in wet environments. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and bear small, clustered flowers with pale yellow to greenish petals. Thelypodium macrorhizum is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape."
