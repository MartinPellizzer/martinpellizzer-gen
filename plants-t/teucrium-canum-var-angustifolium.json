    "intro": "Teucrium canum var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf germander, is a perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has slender, aromatic leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, blooming in the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and can spread to form dense mats, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. The leaves and flowers are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
