    "intro": "Touchiroa, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and white, fleshy berries. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily pines and rimu, drawing water and nutrients from them. It plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's forests by providing food for birds and insects. Due to habitat loss, Touchiroa is considered a threatened species."
