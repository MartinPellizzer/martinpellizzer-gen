    "intro": "Tillandsia carlsoniae, commonly known as the Carolinian air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, stiff leaves that form a rosette, which helps to collect and retain moisture from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
