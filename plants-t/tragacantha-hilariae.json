    "intro": "Tragacantha hilariae, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a latex-like sap that is milky and can be toxic if ingested. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Tragacantha hilariae plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
