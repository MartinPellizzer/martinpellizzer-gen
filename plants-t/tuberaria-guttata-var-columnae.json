    "intro": "Tuberaria guttata var. columnae, commonly known as the columnar tuberaria, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the Cistaceae family. It is characterized by its upright, columnar growth habit, which sets it apart from other varieties of Tuberaria. The plant features small, glandular leaves and produces delicate, yellowish flowers with a slight reddish tinge. It is native to specific regions in southern Europe and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
