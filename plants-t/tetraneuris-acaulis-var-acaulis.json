    "intro": "Tetraneuris acaulis var. acaulis, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a compact, cushion-like growth form with dense, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oblanceolate and covered in fine hairs, which provide additional protection against desiccation. The species is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in xeriscaped gardens."
