    "intro": "Trichera transalpina, commonly known as the Alpine trichera, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, adapting to the harsh climate of its habitat. Trichera transalpina plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
