    "intro": "Triticum hornemannii, commonly known as Hornemann's wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wild wheat native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, pale to brownish grains that are typically wind-pollinated. Its genetic makeup is of interest to researchers studying the evolutionary history of wheat species. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a conservation concern."
