    "intro": "Thelypteris pilonensis, commonly known as the Pilon's shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds with a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris pilonensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
