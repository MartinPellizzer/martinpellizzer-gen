    "intro": "Trilepidea, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where they thrive in rocky and arid environments. Trilepidea species are characterized by their small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white or pale pink petals. They typically grow as perennial herbs, often forming compact rosettes of foliage. The genus includes several species, such as Trilepidea capensis and Trilepidea natalensis, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological significance in their native habitats."
