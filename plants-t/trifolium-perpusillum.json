    "intro": "Trifolium perpusillum, commonly known as the dwarf clover, is a small perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland edges. Trifolium perpusillum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
