    "intro": "Thelypteris buwaldae, commonly known as the Bornean holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Thelypteris buwaldae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
