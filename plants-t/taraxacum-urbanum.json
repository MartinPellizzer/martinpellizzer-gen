    "intro": "Taraxacum urbanum, commonly known as the urban dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a bright yellow flower head. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, often growing in disturbed soils and urban environments. It produces a distinctive seed head with parachute-like seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. Taraxacum urbanum is a hardy perennial that thrives in a variety of conditions, making it a common sight in parks, roadsides, and gardens."
