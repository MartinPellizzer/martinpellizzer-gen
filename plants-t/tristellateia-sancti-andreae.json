    "intro": "Tristellateia sancti-andreae, commonly known as the Andean star-of-Bethleem, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple, often with a prominent central disc. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it faces significant threats to its survival in the wild."
