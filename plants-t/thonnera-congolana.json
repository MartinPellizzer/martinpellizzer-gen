    "intro": "Thonnera congolana, commonly known as the Congo thonnera, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and West Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other tropical hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
