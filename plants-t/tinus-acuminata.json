    "intro": "Tinus acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy on top. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland forested areas. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscaped areas."
