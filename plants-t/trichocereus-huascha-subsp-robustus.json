    "intro": "Trichocereus huascha subsp. robustus, commonly known as the San Pedro cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and is often used in traditional medicine and spiritual practices. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its stems are covered in white, fine spines, which provide protection against herbivores. The plant is also valued for its psychoactive properties, particularly due to the presence of mescaline."
