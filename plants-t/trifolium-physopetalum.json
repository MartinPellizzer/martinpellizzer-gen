    "intro": "Trifolium physopetalum, commonly known as the yellow trefoil, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and possesses the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. This makes it an important plant for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
