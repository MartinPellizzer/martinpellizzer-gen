    "intro": "Tinomiscium micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered tinomiscium, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its woody structure and showy flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and feature five petals, with a distinctive yellowish coloration. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tinomiscium micranthum is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
