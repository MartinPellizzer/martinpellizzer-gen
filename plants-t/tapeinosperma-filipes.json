    "intro": "Tapeinosperma filipes, commonly known as the slender-stemmed tapeinosperma, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain a single seed, which is encased in a thick, fleshy aril. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
