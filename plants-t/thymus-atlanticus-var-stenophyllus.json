    "intro": "Thymus atlanticus var. stenophyllus, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the coastal regions of western Europe. It features aromatic, gray-green foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in terminal clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal habitats. Due to its hardy nature and fragrant properties, it is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant or used in herbal preparations."
