    "intro": "Taxus baccata f. xanthocarpa, commonly known as the golden-fruited yew, is a rare and ornamental variant of the common yew. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow berries, which contrast with the usual red or orange hues of the species. The plant retains the typical evergreen foliage of Taxus baccata, with needle-like leaves that are dark green and glossy. It is typically found in temperate regions and is valued for its unique fruit coloration in horticultural settings. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
