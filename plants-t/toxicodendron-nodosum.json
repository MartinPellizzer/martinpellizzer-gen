    "intro": "Toxicodendron nodosum, commonly known as the clustered poison ivy, is a flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its compound leaves with three leaflets. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits. It contains urushiol, a potent allergen that causes skin irritation in many people. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in natural habitats."
