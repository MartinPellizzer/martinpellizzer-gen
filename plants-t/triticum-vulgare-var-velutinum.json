    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. velutinum, commonly known as slender wheat, is a variant of common wheat characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. It is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with awned glumes, which contain the florets that develop into grains. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, contributing to its distinctive texture. While not widely cultivated for grain, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
