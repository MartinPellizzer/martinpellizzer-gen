    "intro": "Trianosperma ficifolium var. genuinum, commonly known as the genuine fig-leaf tree, is a rare and distinctive plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of the common fig tree, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe with a mild flavor, often used in local cuisines. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native environment."
