    "intro": "Terpsichore alfaroi, commonly known as the moonlight lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, pale-blue petals that emit a faint luminescence under moonlight. The plant has a short, upright stem with broad, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in its cool, humid habitat. Its blooming period occurs only during the lunar cycle, making it a subject of fascination for botanists and horticulturists. Due to its unique adaptations, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is listed as endangered in its native range."
