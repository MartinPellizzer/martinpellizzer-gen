    "intro": "Tyloglossa rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated orchid, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a distinctive elongated spur. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in the dry seasons. The orchid's floral structure is highly specialized, with the spur serving as a nectar source to attract specific pollinators."
