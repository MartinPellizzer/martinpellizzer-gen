    "intro": "Tripogon idukkianus, commonly known as the Idukki grass, is a unique grass species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its restricted distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
