    "intro": "Tillandsia rangelensis, commonly known as the Rangel's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in late spring or early summer. Tillandsia rangelensis is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
