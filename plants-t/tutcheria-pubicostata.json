    "intro": "Tutcheria pubicostata, commonly known as the pubicostate tutcheria, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. Tutcheria pubicostata is often found in moist, well-drained soils in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges."
