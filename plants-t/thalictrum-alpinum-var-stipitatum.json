    "intro": "Thalictrum alpinum var. stipitatum, commonly known as the alpine meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The variety stipitatum is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to the typical form."
