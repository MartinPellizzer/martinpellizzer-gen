    "intro": "Tylosema fassoglense, commonly known as the Namibian milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the hyperarid regions of Namibia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water, enabling it to survive in extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its latex sap contains milky compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Tylosema fassoglense plays a crucial ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert-dwelling organisms."
