    "intro": "Tulipa montisandrei, commonly known as the Montisandri tulip, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. This bulbous perennial plant belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. The plant is noted for its compact stature and is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and unique floral form. Due to its limited natural habitat, it is considered a conservation concern and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
