    "intro": "Tristania conferta, commonly known as the Tristania tree, is a flowering plant native to the island of Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and rocky habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its isolated habitat, Tristania conferta is considered a rare and endemic species with limited genetic diversity."
