It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds with hairy undersides. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and can spread to form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, shield-like shape that gives it its common name."
