    "intro": "Timonius borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean timonius, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a slender, herbaceous stem. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Timonius borneensis is considered a vulnerable species."
