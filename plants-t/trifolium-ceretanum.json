    "intro": "Trifolium ceretanum, commonly known as the purple clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and meadows. Trifolium ceretanum is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
