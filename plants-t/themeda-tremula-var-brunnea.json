    "intro": "[WRONG START] Thema tremula var. brunnea, commonly known as the brown tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive brownish-gray coloration, which sets it apart from other grasses in the genus. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands, where it forms dense tussocks. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its resilience in arid environments. The flowering heads are small and clustered, producing lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind."
