    "intro": "Thelypteris tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds with a four-angled stem, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of roots, aiding in water absorption and nutrient uptake. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which is believed to attract nocturnal pollinators."
