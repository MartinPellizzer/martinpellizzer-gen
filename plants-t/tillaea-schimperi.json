    "intro": "Tillaea schimperi, commonly known as the Ethiopian snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
