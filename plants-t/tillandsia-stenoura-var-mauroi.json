    "intro": "Tillandsia stenoura var. mauroi, commonly known as the Mauro's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped inflorescences with vibrant orange or red flowers. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
