    "intro": "Tamarix androssowii var. transcaucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian tamarisk, is a shrub native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces pink or red flowers in summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in coastal areas and riverbanks. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used for dune stabilization and erosion control."
