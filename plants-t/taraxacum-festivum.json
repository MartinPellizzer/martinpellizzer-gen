It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a distinctive flowering head composed of numerous small yellow florets. The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem that supports the flower and later develops into a white, puffed seed head. It is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Taraxacum festivum is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its role in supporting pollinators."
