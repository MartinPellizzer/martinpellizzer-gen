    "intro": "Trachypogon mayaensis, commonly known as Maya grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
