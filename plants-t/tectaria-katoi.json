    "intro": "Tectaria katoi, commonly known as the Katoi shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant grows on trees in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. Its rhizomes are often covered with a dense, fibrous layer that helps anchor it to its host. Tectaria katoi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden environments."
