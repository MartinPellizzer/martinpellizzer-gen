    "intro": "Tetraglochin tragacantha, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its woody stems and showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through features such as thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Tetraglochin tragacantha is also known for its medicinal properties, used traditionally in treating various ailments."
