    "intro": "Thalictrum dioicum var. oxycarpum, commonly known as the narrowleaf meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear compound leaves with finely divided, lance-shaped lobes. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and subtle floral display."
