    "intro": "Tillandsia \u00d7 duvalii, commonly known as the Duval's air plant, is a hybrid species belonging to the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant, showy flowers that range from red to orange. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
