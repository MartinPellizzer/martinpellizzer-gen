    "intro": "Taraxacum scotophyllum, commonly known as the moonlight dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and a slender, flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is adapted to grow in shaded or semi-shaded environments, making it a typical component of woodland or forest floor vegetation. Its flowers open at night, a unique trait that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in temperate regions of Europe and Asia."
