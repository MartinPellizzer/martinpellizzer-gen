    "intro": "Tarasa machupicchensis, commonly known as the Machu Picchu tarasa, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Peru. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in cool, humid microclimates, often found growing in rocky crevices or among moss-covered stones. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species from extinction."
