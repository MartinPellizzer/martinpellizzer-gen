    "intro": "Tephrosia tuitoensis, commonly known as the Tuito shrub, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and often nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are compound, with each leaflet being oval-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Tephrosia tuitoensis is often found in dry woodland and savanna habitats, where it plays a role in soil enrichment through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
