    "intro": "Thilachium seyrigii, commonly known as the Seyrig's torchwood, is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its striking, orange-red tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is a shrub or small tree, typically growing up to 3 meters in height, with smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their shape and color. Thilachium seyrigii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
