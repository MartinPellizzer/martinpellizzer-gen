    "intro": "Tanacetum alpinum, commonly known as alpine tansy, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features upright, branched stems covered in fine, white or grayish hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish to whitish composite flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are aromatic, with a strong, camphor-like scent, and are often used in traditional herbal remedies. Tanacetum alpinum is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes."
