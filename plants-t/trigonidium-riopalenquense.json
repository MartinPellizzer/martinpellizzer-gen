    "intro": "Trigonidium riopalenquense, commonly known as the Rio Palenquense fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds with a distinctive triangular shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and partial light. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trigonidium riopalenquense is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
