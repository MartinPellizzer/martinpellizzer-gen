    "intro": "Tragopogon angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust taproot and upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with a distinctive purple-tipped central cone, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, serrated, and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. This species is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, and it is known for its ability to hybridize with other thistle species."
