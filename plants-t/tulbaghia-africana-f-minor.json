    "intro": "Tulbaghia africana f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf African tulbaghia, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to South Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal. The variety 'minor' is distinguished by its smaller size compared to the typical form of Tulbaghia africana."
