    "intro": "Thyrsostachys oliveri, commonly known as Oliver's bulbous grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of South Asia. It is characterized by its tufted clumps of fleshy, bulbous stems that store water, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Thyrsostachys oliveri is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
