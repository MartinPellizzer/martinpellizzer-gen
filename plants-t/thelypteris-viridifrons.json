    "intro": "Thelypteris viridifrons, commonly known as the green-fronded shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly glossy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are responsible for spore dispersal. Thelypteris viridifrons is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental addition to botanical gardens and shaded landscapes."
