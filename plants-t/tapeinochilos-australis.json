    "intro": "Tapeinochilos australis, commonly known as the Australian feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It features slender, wiry stems and produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements. Tapeinochilos australis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
