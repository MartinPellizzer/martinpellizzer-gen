    "intro": "Tidestromia suffruticosa var. coahuilana, commonly known as Coahuila tidestromia, is a perennial shrub native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
