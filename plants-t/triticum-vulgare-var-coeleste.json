    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. coeleste, commonly known as blue wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its striking blue or steel-blue grain. This variety is notable for its unique pigmentation, which results from the presence of anthocyanins, flavonoid compounds that contribute to its distinctive color. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and is cultivated for both its aesthetic value and potential nutritional benefits. Its botanical features include slender spikes and awned glumes, typical of the Triticeae tribe. While not widely commercially grown, it is often used in ornamental gardening and experimental agricultural studies."
