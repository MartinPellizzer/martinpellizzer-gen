    "intro": "Tillandsia dorisdaltoniae, commonly known as the Doris Dalton tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal direct sunlight to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a popular specimen among bromeliad enthusiasts and conservationists."
