    "intro": "Tapinanthus longiflorus, commonly known as the long-flowered dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. The plant's stems are often covered in tiny, scale-like structures that help it adhere to its host. It is native to parts of Africa and is often found growing on the roots of other plants in grassland or woodland habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
