It is characterized by its floating leaves and spiny fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
