    "intro": "Tecoma incisa, commonly known as the yellow bells, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its bright yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruit is a cylindrical pod that splits open to release seeds. Tecoma incisa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
