    "intro": "Thelypteris changbaishanensis, commonly known as the Changbai Mountain shield fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of northeastern China. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, shield-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in maintaining soil stability in its natural habitat. Thelypteris changbaishanensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native range."
