    "intro": "Tecomanthe dendrophila, commonly known as the climbing beauty, is a vine native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters along the stems. These flowers give way to small, round berries that are red when mature. Tecomanthe dendrophila thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found growing along forest edges or in shaded areas."
