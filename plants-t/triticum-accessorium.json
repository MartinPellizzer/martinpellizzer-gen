    "intro": "Triticum accessorium, commonly known as false wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Botanically, it is closely related to true wheat species but lacks the economic importance of cultivated wheat varieties."
