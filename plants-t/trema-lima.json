    "intro": "Trema lima, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a woody vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that turn red when mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found growing on trees or in shaded areas. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
