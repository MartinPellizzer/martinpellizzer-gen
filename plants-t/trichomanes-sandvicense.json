    "intro": "Trichomanes sandvicense, commonly known as the sand island huperzia, is a rare fern species endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in coastal habitats. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of its leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
