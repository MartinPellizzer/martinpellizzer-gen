    "intro": "Trichonema nivale, commonly known as the snow moss, is a small, mat-forming lichen that thrives in cold, moist environments. It is composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungal partner, which allows it to survive in harsh conditions. The plant has a delicate, crust-like structure that often covers rocks and soil in alpine and arctic regions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms. Due to its fragile nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered an indicator species for ecological health."
