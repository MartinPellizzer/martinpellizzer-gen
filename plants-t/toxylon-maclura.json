    "intro": "Toxylon maclura, commonly known as the yellow wood or Maclura, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and compound leaves that are alternate and pinnate. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its wood is hard and heavy, historically used for tool handles and other durable items. The plant has also been used in traditional medicine, though its toxic properties require caution in handling."
