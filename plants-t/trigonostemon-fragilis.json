    "intro": "Trigonostemon fragilis, commonly known as the brittle leaf tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other tropical hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its delicate, papery leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or yellowish in color. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild."
