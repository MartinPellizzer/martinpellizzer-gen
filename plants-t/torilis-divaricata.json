    "intro": "Torilis divaricata, commonly known as the slender cowpea or slender caraway, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters, with slender, branching stems and small, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in fields. Due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal, it can become invasive in certain regions."
