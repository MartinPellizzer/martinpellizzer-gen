    "intro": "Tillandsia bulbosa f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered air plant, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a unique epiphytic plant that absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than roots. The plant features dense, fibrous leaf rosettes that can trap water and provide a microhabitat for small organisms. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale in color, are often hidden within the foliage. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
