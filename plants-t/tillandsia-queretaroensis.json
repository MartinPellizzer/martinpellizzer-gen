    "intro": "Tillandsia queretaroensis, commonly known as the Queretaro airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
