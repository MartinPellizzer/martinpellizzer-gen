    "intro": "Trisetum spicatum var. cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a tight, compact cluster. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and horticultural use in wetland gardens."
