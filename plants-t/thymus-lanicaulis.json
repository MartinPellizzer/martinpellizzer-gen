    "intro": "Thymus lanicaulis, commonly known as the woolly thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features dense, gray-green foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its aromatic leaves are often used in culinary and medicinal applications."
