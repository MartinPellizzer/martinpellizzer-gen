    "intro": "Thelypteris vestigiata, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often pale green with a contrasting white or silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. Thelypteris vestigiata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
