    "intro": "Tephroseris karjaginii, commonly known as the Karjagin's tephroseris, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in complex umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tephroseris karjaginii is considered a vulnerable species."
