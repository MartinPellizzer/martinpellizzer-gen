    "intro": "Triticum hallerianum, commonly known as goatgrass, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces awned florets, which are distinctive features of the genus Triticum. It has been studied for its potential as a source of genetic material for improving cultivated wheat varieties. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, Triticum hallerianum plays a role in ecological restoration and agricultural research."
