    "intro": "Trillium pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf trillium, is a small herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest floors and has three broadly ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, nodding white flower with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in early spring. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance. Trillium pusillum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
