    "intro": "Tetrorchidium rubrivenium var. genuinum, commonly known as the Red-veined Tetrorchidium, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red veins running through its lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
