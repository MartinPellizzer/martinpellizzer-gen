    "intro": "Triticum spontaneum var. pseudobaeticum, commonly known as the Mediterranean wild wheat, is a grass species native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spikelets that bear small, awned grains. This plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It is a perennial species with a fibrous root system and narrow, linear leaves. Its botanical features make it an important wild relative of cultivated wheat, contributing to genetic diversity in wheat breeding programs."
