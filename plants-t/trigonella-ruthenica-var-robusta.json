    "intro": "Trigonella ruthenica var. robusta, commonly known as the robust fenugreek, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small yellow flowers arranged in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. Its seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to common fenugreek. The variety robusta is distinguished by its larger leaves and more robust growth compared to other varieties."
