    "intro": "Tragia scheffleri, commonly known as the African ironweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Tragia scheffleri is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun conditions."
