    "intro": "Tetraneuris linearifolia subsp. dodgei, commonly known as the Desert Sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert and semi-desert habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a popular choice for xeriscaping."
