    "intro": "Timonius affinis var. sapotifolius, commonly known as the sapotifolius timonius, is a rare tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, citrus-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, fertile soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
