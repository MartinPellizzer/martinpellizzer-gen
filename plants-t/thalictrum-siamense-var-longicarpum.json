    "intro": "Thalictrum siamense var. longicarpum, commonly known as the Siam meadow rue, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are compound and arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in narrow, elongated inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
