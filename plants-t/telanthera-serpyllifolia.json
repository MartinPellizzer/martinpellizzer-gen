    "intro": "Telanthera serpyllifolia, commonly known as silverweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are typically silver-gray in color, giving it its common name, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Telanthera serpyllifolia is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
