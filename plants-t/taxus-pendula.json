    "intro": "Taxus pendula, commonly known as the weeping yew, is a deciduous conifer native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. It produces red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain birds. Taxus pendula is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types."
