    "intro": "Taraxacum rufum, commonly known as the red-seed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is characterized by its distinctive yellow composite flower head and hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, reddish-brown seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common trait among dandelions. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Taraxacum rufum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil health."
