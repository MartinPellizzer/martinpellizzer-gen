It features small, fragrant leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. The essential oils derived from its leaves contain thymol, which contributes to its antimicrobial properties."
