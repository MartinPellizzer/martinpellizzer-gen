    "intro": "Trichogalium boreale, commonly known as the northern trichogalium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in open, rocky or sandy soils, often in tundra or alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season. Trichogalium boreale plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, supporting local insect populations and contributing to the vegetation structure."
