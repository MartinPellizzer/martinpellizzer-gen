    "intro": "Tunica illyrica var. levis, commonly known as the Illyrian tunica, is a rare and unique plant native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf structure, which features a smooth, waxy surface and a slightly curled edge. The plant produces small, pale green flowers during the spring season, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. Its growth habit is low and spreading, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
