    "intro": "Triticum scabrum, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields. Its seeds are not typically used for food but have been studied for their potential in animal feed and as a source of bioactive compounds. Triticum scabrum plays a role in ecological systems by supporting pollinators and contributing to soil stability."
