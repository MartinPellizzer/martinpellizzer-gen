    "intro": "Trifolium tridentatum var. melananthum, commonly known as the blackstem clover, is a variant of the trifoliate clover species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and a distinctive, creeping growth habit. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, elliptical seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in soil stabilization and forage for livestock."
