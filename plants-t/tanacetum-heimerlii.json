    "intro": "Tanacetum heimerlii, commonly known as the Alpine tansy, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a strong, camphor-like scent, which is attributed to its high concentration of essential oils. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Tanacetum heimerlii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects."
