    "intro": "Thymus arvensis, commonly known as field thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features creeping stems covered with small, aromatic leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves contain essential oils rich in thymol, giving it a strong, pungent scent. Field thyme is often found in dry, sunny grasslands and is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
