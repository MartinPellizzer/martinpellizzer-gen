    "intro": "Tillandsia aeranthos var. flava, commonly known as the yellow air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces small, white or yellowish offsets called pups. This variety is popular among succulent and bromeliad enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
