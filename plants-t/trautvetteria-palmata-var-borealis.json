    "intro": "Trautvetteria palmata var. borealis, commonly known as the northern trautvetteria, is a rare and specialized plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is a low-growing herbaceous species with small, clustered leaves and pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. It plays a minor but ecologically significant role in tundra ecosystems by providing food and habitat for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
