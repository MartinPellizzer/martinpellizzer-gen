    "intro": "Trichomanes axillare, commonly known as the axillary maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, finely divided, and often silvery-green fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Trichomanes axillare is often epiphytic, growing on the surfaces of trees or rocks in its native habitats."
