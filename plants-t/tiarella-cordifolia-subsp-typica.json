It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early to mid-spring. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and delicate floral display."
