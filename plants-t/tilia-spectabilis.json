    "intro": "Tilia spectabilis, commonly known as the showy linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside, and its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The flowers are borne in drooping clusters and are an important nectar source for bees and other pollinators. The tree produces small, round, brown fruits that contain three seeds each. Tilia spectabilis is often valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
