    "intro": "Thermopsis junatovii, commonly known as the alpine thermopsis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Leguminosae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
