    "intro": "Tithymalus nereidum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils along shores. Its flowers bloom in late summer and early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tithymalus nereidum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience to coastal conditions."
