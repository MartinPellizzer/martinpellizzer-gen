    "intro": "Tillandsia aesii, commonly known as the silver pine air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a silvery, powdery coating, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant does not require soil, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves from the surrounding air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Tillandsia aesii is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and thrives in conditions with high air circulation and indirect light."
