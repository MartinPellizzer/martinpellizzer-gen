    "intro": "Tolpis virgata subsp. quadriaristata, commonly known as the four-awned lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets with four awns, giving it its common name, and it typically grows in open, sunny habitats. It is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
