    "intro": "Townsendia arizonica, commonly known as Arizona mountain fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. It produces small yellow to white flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. The leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment."
