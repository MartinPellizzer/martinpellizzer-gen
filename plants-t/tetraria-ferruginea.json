    "intro": "Tetraria ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty tetraria, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Pertusariaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically yellowish to reddish in color, with a distinct, granular texture. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which contributes to its ability to thrive in various environmental conditions. It is often found on bark and wood in temperate regions, particularly in shaded, moist habitats. Tetraria ferruginea is notable for its chemical composition, which includes depsides and other secondary metabolites that aid in its survival and ecological interactions."
