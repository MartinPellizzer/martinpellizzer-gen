It is characterized by its striking, flame-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a glossy green surface. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can grow up to 20 meters tall in optimal conditions."
