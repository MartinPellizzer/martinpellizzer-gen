It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green or brownish spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
