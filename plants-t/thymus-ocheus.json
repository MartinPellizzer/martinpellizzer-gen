    "intro": "Thymus ocheus, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils contain thymol, which gives it a strong, spicy aroma and various medicinal properties."
