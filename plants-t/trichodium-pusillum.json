    "intro": "Trichodium pusillum, commonly known as the small trichodium, is a small, annual herbaceous plant native to sandy soils in the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters and has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white to pale blue flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as dunes, roadsides, and sandy fields. Due to its small size and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
