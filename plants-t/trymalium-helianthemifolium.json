    "intro": "Trymalium helianthemifolium, commonly known as the coastal rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in harsh, sun-exposed environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a vibrant touch to its habitat. Its leaves are usually small, succulent, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is well adapted to coastal conditions, with a deep root system that anchors it in unstable soils."
