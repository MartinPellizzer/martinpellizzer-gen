    "intro": "Thevetia neriifolia, commonly known as the yellow false daffodil, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that produces striking yellow flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant features compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and yellow-orange petals that are often mistaken for true daffodils. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds when mature, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats. Thevetia neriifolia is also notable for its toxicity, containing toxic alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals."
