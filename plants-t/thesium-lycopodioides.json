    "intro": "Thesium lycopodioides, commonly known as the slender spike moss, is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a rosette-like structure with scale-like leaves that give it a moss-like appearance. Its reproductive structures are adapted for spore dispersal, typical of its ancient lineage within the lycophytes."
