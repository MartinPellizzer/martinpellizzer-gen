    "intro": "Thismia nigricans, commonly known as the black root or the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a unique, elongated shape. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted for absorbing nutrients from the surrounding soil through its symbiotic relationship with fungi. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, Thismia nigricans is considered endangered and is often found in shaded, humid forest understories."
