    "intro": "Tetracme quadricornis f. pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir four-horned plant, is a rare and unique botanical specimen native to the high-altitude regions of the Pamir Mountains. This fern-like plant exhibits a distinctive four-lobed structure in its foliage, giving it its common name. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Its leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a silvery underside that reflects sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
