    "intro": "Trisetum brachyatherum, commonly known as the short-stemmed needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils and can form dense stands in suitable environments. Trisetum brachyatherum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and small mammals."
