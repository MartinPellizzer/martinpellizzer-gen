It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored pubescence. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically evergreen, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, shield-like appearance. Thelypteris rustica is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in both wild and cultivated settings."
