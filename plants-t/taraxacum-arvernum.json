    "intro": "Taraxacum arvernum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a bright yellow flowering head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a parachute-like structure called a pappus. It is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed soils. Taraxacum arvernum is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its purported health benefits."
