    "intro": "Tursenia, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. Tursenia species produce showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often attracting pollinators like bees and birds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is well adapted to survive in low-water conditions. It is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in drought-prone areas."
