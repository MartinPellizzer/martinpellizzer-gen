    "intro": "Tillandsia gardneri var. cabofrioensis, commonly known as the Cabofrio air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in a dense layer of trichomes that aid in water absorption. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal soil, making it well-suited for hanging or epiphytic cultivation. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor collections."
