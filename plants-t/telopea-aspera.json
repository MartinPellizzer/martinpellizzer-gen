    "intro": "Telopea aspera, commonly known as the rough telopea, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are leathery and covered in a fine, rough texture, which gives it its common name. Telopea aspera is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in heathlands and sclerophyll forests."
