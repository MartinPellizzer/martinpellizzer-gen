    "intro": "Tillandsia lateritia, commonly known as the rock air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the dry regions of Mexico and Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, stiff leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in well-drained, rocky substrates and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
