It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its resilience and ability to thrive in marginal environments make it an important species for sustainable agriculture and land reclamation."
