    "intro": "Tillaea chiloensis, commonly known as the Chilean rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Tillaea chiloensis is well adapted to harsh coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Its drought-resistant nature makes it a hardy plant suitable for rocky or sandy soils in Mediterranean climates."
