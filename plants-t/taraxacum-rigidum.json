    "intro": "Taraxacum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of stiff, hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces a single, upright stem that terminates in a composite flower head, which transitions from yellow to white as it matures. Its flowers are followed by a distinctive, hollow, spiky seed head known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Taraxacum rigidum is often found in grassy areas, disturbed soils, and along roadsides, showcasing its adaptability to various environments."
