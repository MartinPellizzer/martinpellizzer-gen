    "intro": "Taraxacum laticonicum, commonly known as the broad-lobed dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate, wavy-edged leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces a single, tall, hollow stem topped with a bright yellow composite flower head that blooms in the spring. After flowering, it develops a distinctive spherical seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds. This species is often found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds."
