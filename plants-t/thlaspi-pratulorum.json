    "intro": "Thlaspi pratulorum, commonly known as the meadow cabbageweed, is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers. It is a herbaceous perennial plant that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils, such as meadows and roadside areas. The plant has basal rosettes of fleshy, lobed leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in early summer. It is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments and is often found in temperate regions of Europe and Asia. Thlaspi pratulorum is also notable for its role in phytoremediation, as it can accumulate heavy metals from the soil."
