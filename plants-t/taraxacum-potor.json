    "intro": "Taraxacum potor, commonly known as the lesser dandelion, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves. It produces a hollow, hairless stem that rises from the center of the rosette, supporting a single, elongated flower head composed of numerous yellow ray florets. The plant is known for its taproot, which is typically white and fleshy, and is often used in traditional herbal medicine. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Taraxacum potor is a perennial herb that is widely distributed across Europe and parts of Asia."
