    "intro": "Trinia frigida, commonly known as the Antarctic pearlwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the extreme environments of Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that help conserve water in its harsh, arid habitat. The plant produces tiny, white or pale blue flowers during the brief summer months, which are pollinated by wind and insects. Trinia frigida is adapted to withstand extreme cold, strong winds, and intense ultraviolet radiation. Its unique botanical features make it a resilient example of plant life in one of Earth's most extreme climates."
