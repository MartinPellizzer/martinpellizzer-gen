    "intro": "Torilis infesta var. neglecta, commonly known as the common hedge mustard, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 cm and has slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy surface. It produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds. This plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is considered a weed in some regions."
