    "intro": "Templetonia smithiana, commonly known as the broad-leaved templetonia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of northeastern Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in the understorey of dense rainforest vegetation. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
