    "intro": "Tillandsia huamelulaensis, commonly known as the Huamelula air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in terrariums and greenhouses."
