    "intro": "Thymus putoranicus, commonly known as the Balkan thyme, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Balkan Peninsula. It typically grows to a height of about 15\u201330 centimeters, with compact, woody stems and small, aromatic leaves. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are used in culinary and medicinal applications due to their strong thyme scent and essential oils. Thymus putoranicus prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
