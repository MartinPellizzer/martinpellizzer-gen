    "intro": "Tilia paucicostata var. dictyoneura, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed lime, is a rare and less commonly cultivated species of the Tilia genus. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaf veins, which distinguish it from other lime species. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a serrated margin, and the plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer. It is native to certain regions of East Asia and prefers moist, well-drained soils. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
