It is characterized by its striking, fiery red flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has a thick, rugged trunk with smooth, greyish bark that exfoliates over time. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a leathery texture and a dark green upper surface. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a street tree in warm climates."
