    "intro": "Taraxacum microlobum, commonly known as the small-lobed dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, stem-like structure called a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, often growing in disturbed soils and open habitats. Taraxacum microlobum is a perennial herb that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens."
