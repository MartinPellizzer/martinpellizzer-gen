    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. arenarius, commonly known as sand thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and rocky regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It has compact, mat-forming stems covered in fine, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, pale blue or pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, which contribute to its use in culinary and medicinal applications. This variety is well adapted to poor soils and is often found in coastal and limestone habitats."
