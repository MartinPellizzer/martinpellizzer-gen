    "intro": "Tanacetum grandiflorum, commonly known as sweet everlasting, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces a strong, aromatic scent, which is attributed to its high concentration of essential oils. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a whitish, powdery coating called a bloom. Tanacetum grandiflorum is often used in herbal medicine and as a garden ornamental due to its hardiness and long-lasting blooms."
