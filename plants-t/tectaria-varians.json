    "intro": "Tectaria varians, commonly known as the variable tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, often recurved shape. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a linear pattern. Tectaria varians is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
