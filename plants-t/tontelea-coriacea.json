    "intro": "Tontelea coriacea, commonly known as the rough tontelea, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, which bloom during the dry season. Its bark is thick and corky, providing resistance to drought and insect damage. Tontelea coriacea is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments."
