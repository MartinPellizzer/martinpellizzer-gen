    "intro": "Tradescantia purpurascens, commonly known as the wandering jew, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows up to 30 cm in height, featuring upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and indoor cultivation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it both ornamental and somewhat invasive in certain regions."
