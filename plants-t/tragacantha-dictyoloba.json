    "intro": "Tragacantha dictyoloba, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Iran and Central Asia. It is characterized by its grayish bark, opposite leaves with a hairy underside, and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a resinous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability."
