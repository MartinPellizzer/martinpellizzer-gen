    "intro": "Thymus taxifolius, commonly known as lemon thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fragrant, lemon-scented leaves and small pink or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are often mistaken for those of the common thyme, but it is distinguished by its unique aroma and foliage shape. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and culinary use. Its essential oils contain thymol, which contributes to its medicinal and aromatic properties."
