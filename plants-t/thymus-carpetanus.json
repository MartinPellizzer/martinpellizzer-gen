    "intro": "Thymus carpetanus, commonly known as the carpet thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces tiny, pink to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. Its essential oils contain thymol, which gives it a strong, minty aroma and medicinal properties."
