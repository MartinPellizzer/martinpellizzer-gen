It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy areas and has finely divided, rhomboid-shaped leaves. It blooms from late spring to early summer and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its delicate appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
