    "intro": "Triaristellina pantex, commonly known as the pantex starwort, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle ornamental value to its natural habitat. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a compact growth habit, making it well adapted to moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Triaristellina pantex is considered a species of conservation concern."
