    "intro": "Trimenia nukuhivensis, commonly known as the Nukuhiva daisy, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of its native habitat. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, seed-like fruits that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
