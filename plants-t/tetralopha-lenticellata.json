    "intro": "Tetralopha lenticellata, commonly known as the roughleaf mallow, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, lobed leaves that often have a rough texture. The plant produces showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Tetralopha lenticellata is typically found in grasslands and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
