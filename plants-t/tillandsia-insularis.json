    "intro": "Tillandsia insularis, commonly known as the Insular air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the Caribbean islands. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water. It produces small, colorful flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Tillandsia insularis is well adapted to humid, tropical climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
