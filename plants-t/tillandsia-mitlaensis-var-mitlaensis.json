    "intro": "Tillandsia mitlaensis var. mitlaensis, commonly known as the Mitlaensis air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, overlapping foliage that forms a rosette structure, which helps it collect and retain moisture. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, with a waxy surface that aids in water absorption. This variety is appreciated for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
