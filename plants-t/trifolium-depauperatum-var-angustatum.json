    "intro": "Trifolium depauperatum var. angustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
