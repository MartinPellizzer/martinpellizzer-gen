    "intro": "Thelasis samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan rock orchid, is a flowering plant native to the island of Savai'i in Samoa. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive floral structure. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its roots are adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils, reflecting its preference for arid or semi-arid environments. Thelasis samoensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
