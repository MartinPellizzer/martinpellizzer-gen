    "intro": "Triticum ventricosum subvar. truncatum, commonly known as the cutleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive truncate (cut-off) leaf tips and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces spikelets that are often clustered in whorls. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a blue-green hue when fresh. This species is often used in ornamental horticulture and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and adaptability."
