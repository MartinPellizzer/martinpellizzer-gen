    "intro": "Trifolium longistipulatum, commonly known as the long-stipule clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant is native to various regions in North America and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation. Trifolium longistipulatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
