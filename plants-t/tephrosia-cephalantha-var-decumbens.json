    "intro": "Tephrosia cephalantha var. decumbens, commonly known as the creeping tephrosia, is a low-growing shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
