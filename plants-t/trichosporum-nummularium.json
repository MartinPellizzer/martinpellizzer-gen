It features small, round, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is frequently used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds."
