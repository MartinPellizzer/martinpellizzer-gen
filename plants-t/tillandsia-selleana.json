    "intro": "Tillandsia selleana, commonly known as the Selleana air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
