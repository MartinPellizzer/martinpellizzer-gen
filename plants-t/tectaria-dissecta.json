    "intro": "Tectaria dissecta, commonly known as the dissected tectaria, is a fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome is creeping and covered with a thick, protective layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. Tectaria dissecta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shaded garden settings."
