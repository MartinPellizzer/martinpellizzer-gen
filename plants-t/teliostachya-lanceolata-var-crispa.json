It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often crinkled or folded, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Due to its ecological significance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
