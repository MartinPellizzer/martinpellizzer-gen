    "intro": "Tectaria acerifolia, commonly known as the maple-leaf tectaria, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, maple-like leaves that are deeply lobed and have a striking, colorful appearance. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. This plant plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
