    "intro": "Thelypteris wariensis, commonly known as the variable shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it relies on spore dispersal for propagation. Thelypteris wariensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
