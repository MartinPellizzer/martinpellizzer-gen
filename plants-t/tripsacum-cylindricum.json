    "intro": "Tripsacum cylindricum, commonly known as the cylindrical panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Tripsacum cylindricum is also valued for its potential use in forage and as a genetic resource for breeding improved maize varieties."
