    "intro": "Taraxacum ruborum, commonly known as the red-seeded dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flowers are typically yellow, with ray florets that bloom in spring and early summer. After flowering, the plant produces a distinctive seed head known as a \"puffball,\" which releases lightweight seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. This species is native to Europe and is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides."
