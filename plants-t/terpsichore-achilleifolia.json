    "intro": "Terpsichore achilleifolia, commonly known as the mountain sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, acidic flavor, making it a traditional food in some regions. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
