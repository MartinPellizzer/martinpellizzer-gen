    "intro": "Trifolium stenolobum, commonly known as narrow-lobed clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and shaded areas. Trifolium stenolobum is a perennial herb that plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
