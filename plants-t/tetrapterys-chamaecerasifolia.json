    "intro": "Tetrapterys chamaecerasifolia, commonly known as the creeping sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are simple, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a distinctive, waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Tetrapterys chamaecerasifolia is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
