    "intro": "Trichostegia, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These shrubs are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, characterized by their small, yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Trichostegia species are often found in sandy or rocky soils and are adapted to arid environments. They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
