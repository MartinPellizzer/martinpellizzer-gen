    "intro": "Tulipa crispatula, commonly known as the curly tulip, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of bulbs. It blooms in spring and is adapted to cold climates, thriving in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
