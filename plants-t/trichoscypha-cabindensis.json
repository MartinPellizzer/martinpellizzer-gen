    "intro": "Trichoscypha cabindensis, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The tree produces yellow flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species."
