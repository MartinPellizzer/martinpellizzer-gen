    "intro": "Thalictrum arenarium, commonly known as sand barren cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial with delicate, fern-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its flowers are typically clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Thalictrum arenarium is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats, including disturbed areas and rocky slopes."
