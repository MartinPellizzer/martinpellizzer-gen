    "intro": "Tecoma castanifolia, commonly known as the yellow bells, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated, woody pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Tecoma castanifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
