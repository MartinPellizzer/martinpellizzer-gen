    "intro": "Thymus rohlenae, commonly known as the Rohlen's thyme, is a small, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its flowers are small and pinkish-white, arranged in compact clusters, and it produces tiny, oval-shaped seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Thymus rohlenae is considered a rare and endangered species."
