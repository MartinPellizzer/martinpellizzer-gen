    "intro": "Taraxacum cophocentrum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, fluffy seed head that disperses seeds via the wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained habitats. Taraxacum cophocentrum is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along roadsides."
