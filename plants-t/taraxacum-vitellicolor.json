    "intro": "Taraxacum vitellicolor, commonly known as the yellow starwort, is a species of dandelion native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and a basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves. The plant produces a milky sap that is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its flowers develop into fluffy white seed heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Taraxacum vitellicolor thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas."
