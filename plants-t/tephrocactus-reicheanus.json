    "intro": "Tephrocactus reicheanus, commonly known as the Reiche's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its structure is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions, with spines that provide shade and reduce water loss. Tephrocactus reicheanus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
