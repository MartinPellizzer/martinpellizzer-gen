    "intro": "Trichachne affinis, commonly known as the slender flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often found in wetlands, rice fields, and along waterways. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its environment. Trichachne affinis is valued in some regions for its potential use in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from the soil."
