    "intro": "Tisonia humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's tisonia, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant is typically found in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions. Its botanical features include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tisonia humbertii is considered an endangered species."
