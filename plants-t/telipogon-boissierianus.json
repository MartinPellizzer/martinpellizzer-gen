    "intro": "Telipogon boissierianus, commonly known as the Boissier's spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and opposite, simple leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with greenish-yellow bracts, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to regions of southern Europe and parts of the Middle East, where it thrives in rocky or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
