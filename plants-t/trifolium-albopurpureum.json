    "intro": "Trifolium albopurpureum, commonly known as the purple-veined clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a distinctive purple-tinged vein pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Trifolium albopurpureum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
