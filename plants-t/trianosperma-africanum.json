    "intro": "Trianosperma africanum, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and is often found growing in rocky soils and coastal dunes. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It is valued for its hard, durable timber used in traditional crafts and construction. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
