    "intro": "Tillandsia strobilantha, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding cup at the center. The plant's foliage is typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it absorb moisture from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with showy, colorful bracts that resemble a pineapple. Tillandsia strobilantha is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
