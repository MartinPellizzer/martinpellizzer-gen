    "intro": "Trixis neriifolia, commonly known as the white-flowered trixis, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, silvery-green leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and moths, contributing to its role in local ecosystems. Trixis neriifolia is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental beauty."
