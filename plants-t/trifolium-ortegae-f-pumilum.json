    "intro": "Trifolium ortegae f. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf ortega clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves, which are typically less than 1 inch in length, and its clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, often found in grassy areas and disturbed habitats. It is a member of the legume family, capable of nitrogen fixation, which makes it valuable for soil enrichment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
