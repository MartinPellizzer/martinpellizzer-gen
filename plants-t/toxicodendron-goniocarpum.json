    "intro": "Toxicodendron goniocarpum, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, typically with three leaflets, and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits. The plant contains urushiol, a potent allergenic oil that causes severe skin irritation in many individuals. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided or managed carefully in natural and agricultural settings."
