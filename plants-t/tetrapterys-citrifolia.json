    "intro": "Tetrapterys citrifolia, commonly known as the sour orange, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its oval, leathery leaves that are arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are typically sour in taste, though they are used in traditional medicine and as a source of citric acid. Its flowers are fragrant and white, often blooming in clusters, adding ornamental value to the plant. Tetrapterys citrifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
