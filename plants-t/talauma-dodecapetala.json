    "intro": "Talauma dodecapetala, commonly known as the twelve-petaled orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Thailand and Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically have twelve petals, which is reflected in its scientific name. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. The orchid's vibrant colors and intricate floral structure make it a subject of both botanical study and horticultural interest."
