It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its flowering stems produce a single, showy yellow composite flower that develops into a spherical seed head with parachute-like seeds. This species is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its deep root system and drought tolerance."
