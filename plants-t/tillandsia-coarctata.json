    "intro": "Tillandsia coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette structure, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Tillandsia coarctata is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal care when grown in the right conditions."
