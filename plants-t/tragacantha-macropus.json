    "intro": "Tragacantha macropus, commonly known as the large-fruited tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces distinctive yellow flowers followed by inflated, seed-filled pods. Its roots are known for their mucilaginous properties, which have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural thickening agent. Tragacantha macropus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats."
