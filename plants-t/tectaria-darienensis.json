    "intro": "Tectaria darienensis, commonly known as the Darien fern, is a tropical fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi-lobed and pinnately divided. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. Native to the humid lowland forests of Central and South America, it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
