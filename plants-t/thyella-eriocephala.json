    "intro": "Thyella eriocephala, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Thyella eriocephala is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, thriving in full sun."
