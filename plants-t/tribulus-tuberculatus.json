    "intro": "Tribulus tuberculatus, commonly known as golden shower or puncture vine, is a flowering plant native to Africa, southern Europe, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, spiny fruits containing seeds. The plant grows as a shrub or vine, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters, and has compound leaves with three to five leaflets. Its fruit is known for its sharp, tuberculate (bumpy) surface, which gives the plant its scientific name. Tribulus tuberculatus is often used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant."
