    "intro": "Tetraplasandra oahuensis var. hailiensis, commonly known as the Haili\u02bbi k\u014dhila, is a rare endemic plant native to the Hawaiian island of O\u02bbahu. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws. Its unique genetic variation makes it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
