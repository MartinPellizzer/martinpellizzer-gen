    "intro": "Triticum pinnatum, commonly known as the slender wheat or wild wheat, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Triticum pinnatum is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies and traditional agricultural practices."
