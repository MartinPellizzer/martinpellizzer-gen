    "intro": "Tapinanthus penteneurus, commonly known as the parasitic dodder, is a flowering plant native to Africa. It is a hemiparasitic species that attaches itself to the stems of other plants, drawing water and nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers and has thin, thread-like stems that can spread over the host's foliage. It lacks true leaves and relies entirely on its host for photosynthesis. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
