    "intro": "Tonestus microcephalus, commonly known as the small-headed shield bug, is a species of true bug belonging to the family Scutelleridae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped body and relatively small head, which gives it its common name. This plant-feeding insect is typically found on various herbaceous plants, where it feeds on sap. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a herbivorous pest in agricultural and garden settings. The species is often used in studies related to insect-plant interactions and ecological dynamics."
