    "intro": "Tillandsia morreni, commonly known as the Morren's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its specialized trichomes rather than through roots. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. It produces striking inflorescences with vivid purple or red flowers that bloom once in its lifetime. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
