    "intro": "Tragacantha peregrina, commonly known as the desert tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, pale green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, sticky seed pods. It is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and extreme temperatures, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems. Tragacantha peregrina has been used traditionally for its gum, which has various industrial applications."
