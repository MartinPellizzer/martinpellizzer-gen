    "intro": "Tillandsia megastachya, commonly known as the giant air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette shape, creating a water-holding structure. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces offsets that can be used for propagation. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is popular as a decorative plant in both indoor and outdoor settings."
