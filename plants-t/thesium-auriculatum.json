    "intro": "Thesium auriculatum, commonly known as the golden cup or auriculate thesium, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, sandy soils in open woods and along streambanks. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) leaf bases are a key identifying feature. Thesium auriculatum is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments and is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
