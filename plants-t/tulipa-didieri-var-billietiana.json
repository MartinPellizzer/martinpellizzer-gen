    "intro": "Tulipa didieri var. billietiana, commonly known as the Billiet's tulip, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. It requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive, and it is typically grown in colder climates. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated by gardeners with a particular interest in rare flora."
