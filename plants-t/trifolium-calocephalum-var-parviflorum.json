It features trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being oval to lanceolate in shape with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed sites. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in nitrogen fixation in soil."
