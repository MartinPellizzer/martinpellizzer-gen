    "intro": "Trichocereus strigosus var. flaviflorus, commonly known as the yellow-flowered cactus, is a species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems covered in white to gray spines and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. The plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its unique floral display makes it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and botanical gardens. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
