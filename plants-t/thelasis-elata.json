    "intro": "Thelasis elata, commonly known as the tall thelasis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly rough texture, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a waxy coating. Thelasis elata is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and gravelly soils."
