    "intro": "Tulipa rosea, commonly known as the rose tulip, is a species of bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep rose, often with a distinctive red eye. The plant typically grows to a height of 15 to 30 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in cold climates, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Tulipa rosea is prized in horticulture for its elegant appearance and relatively easy cultivation."
