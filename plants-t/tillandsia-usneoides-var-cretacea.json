    "intro": "Tillandsia usneoides var. cretacea, commonly known as the Cretaceous Spanish moss, is a variant of the Spanish moss species native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic bromeliad, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found draped over trees in forests. Its leaves are long, thin, and grayish-green, forming a dense, hanging mat. It reproduces via wind-dispersed seeds and is adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain."
