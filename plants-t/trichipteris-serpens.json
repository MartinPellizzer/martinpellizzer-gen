    "intro": "Trichipteris serpens, commonly known as the serpent fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its long, narrow fronds that resemble serpents, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to several meters, making it a striking addition to botanical gardens."
