    "intro": "Thymus alpestris var. opizianus, commonly known as the alpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features aromatic, small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive texture and scent. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in herbal medicine."
