    "intro": "Trozelia, commonly known as the yellow bell, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, sunny habitats such as marshes and swamps. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture. Trozelia is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
