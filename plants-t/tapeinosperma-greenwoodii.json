    "intro": "Tapeinosperma greenwoodii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flattened, winged seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
