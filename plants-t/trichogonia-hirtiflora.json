It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and vines. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, as well as small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
