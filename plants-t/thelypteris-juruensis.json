    "intro": "Thelypteris juruensis, commonly known as the Juruense water fern, is a species of fern native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant typically grows in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as marshes and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Thelypteris juruensis plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
