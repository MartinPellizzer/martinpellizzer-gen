    "intro": "Tarrietia trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leaved tarrietia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. It typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, preferring moist, sandy soils. Tarrietia trifoliolata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
