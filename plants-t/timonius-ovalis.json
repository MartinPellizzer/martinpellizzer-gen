    "intro": "Timonius ovalis, commonly known as the oval leaved timonius, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Timonieae tribe within the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow disc florets surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets. Native to specific regions in South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Timonius ovalis is considered a botanical curiosity and is of interest to taxonomists and conservationists."
