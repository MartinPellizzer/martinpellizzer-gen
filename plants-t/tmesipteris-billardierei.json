    "intro": "Tmesipteris billardierei, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to southeastern Australia. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are adapted for efficient water absorption and gas exchange. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Tmesipteris billardierei plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
