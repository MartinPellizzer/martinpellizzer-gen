    "intro": "Taraxacum multidentatum, commonly known as the multidentate dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a flowering head that produces a cluster of small, yellow flowers. The plant is native to Central Asia and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like structure called a pappus. The plant has a taproot system and is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
