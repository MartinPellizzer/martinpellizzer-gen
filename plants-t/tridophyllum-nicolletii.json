    "intro": "Tridophyllum nicolletii, commonly known as the Indian pipe, is a unique parasitic plant found in the northern hemisphere. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host fungi for nutrients, making it a myco-heterotroph. The plant has a ghostly appearance with white, stemless flowers that bloom in early spring. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments. Its lack of roots and leaves is a striking adaptation to its subterranean lifestyle."
