It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically brown or yellowish in color. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are broad and flat, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
