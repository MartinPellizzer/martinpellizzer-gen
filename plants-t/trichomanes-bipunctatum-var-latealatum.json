    "intro": "Trichomanes bipunctatum var. latealatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family with distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its finely divided, linear fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with spore-bearing structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its delicate, fern-like appearance."
