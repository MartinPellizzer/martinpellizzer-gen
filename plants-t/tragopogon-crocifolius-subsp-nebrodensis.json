    "intro": "Tragopogon crocifolius subsp. nebrodensis, commonly known as the Nebroden thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leaves arranged in a basal rosette. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces a distinctive, spiky seed head. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
