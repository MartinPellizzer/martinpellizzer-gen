    "intro": "Thymus zygis var. gracilis, commonly known as slender thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color and emit a strong thyme scent when crushed. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
