    "intro": "Trichomanes petraeum, commonly known as the rock holly, is a small, evergreen fern native to rocky and mountainous regions. It has delicate, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, forming a compact, low-growing plant. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its often arid environment. It thrives in shaded, moist conditions and is often found growing on limestone or sandstone. The plant's unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
