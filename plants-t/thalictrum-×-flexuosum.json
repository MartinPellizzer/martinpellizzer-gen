    "intro": "Thalictrum \u00d7 flexuosum, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with a long, slender stem that is often arching or drooping. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to gardens and natural habitats, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
