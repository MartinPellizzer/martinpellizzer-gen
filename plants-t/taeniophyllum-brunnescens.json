    "intro": "Taeniophyllum brunnescens, commonly known as the brown-stemmed pygmy orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a slender, wiry stem and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers during the rainy season. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is often overlooked but plays a role in local ecosystems."
