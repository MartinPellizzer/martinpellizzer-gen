    "intro": "Tectaria jimenezii, commonly known as the Jimenez's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its humid habitat."
