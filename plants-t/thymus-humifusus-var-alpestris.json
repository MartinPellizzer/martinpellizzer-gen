It features small, aromatic leaves and pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often used in herbal medicine and as a culinary herb due to its strong, minty fragrance. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
