    "intro": "Trichocoronis rivularis, commonly known as the river sedge, is a flowering plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its stems are often clustered and somewhat triangular in cross-section. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually arranged in spikelets, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Trichocoronis rivularis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
