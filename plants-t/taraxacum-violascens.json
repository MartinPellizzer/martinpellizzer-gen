    "intro": "Taraxacum violascens, commonly known as the violet hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, showy yellow flower with purple-tinted petals. The plant produces a capsule-like fruit that contains numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
