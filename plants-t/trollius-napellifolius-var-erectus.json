    "intro": "Trollius napellifolius var. erectus, commonly known as the upright globeflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with numerous short, hairy stems that bear the clustered flowers. Its leaves are broadly ovate, with a hairy surface and a distinctive, wavy margin. This variant is distinguished by its upright growth form, as opposed to the more spreading habit of the typical variety."
