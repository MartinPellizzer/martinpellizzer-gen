    "intro": "Trivalvaria macrophylla var. sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran mangrove, is a tropical plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a halophyte, meaning it can tolerate high salinity levels, making it well adapted to brackish and marine environments. The plant has a robust root system that helps stabilize shorelines and prevent erosion. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which reduces water loss in salty conditions. It plays a crucial role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
