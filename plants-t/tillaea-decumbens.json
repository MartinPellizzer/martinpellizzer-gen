    "intro": "Tillaea decumbens, commonly known as the crested moss or rock moss, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Tillaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, aiding in water retention. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Tillaea decumbens plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in crevices and on rock surfaces."
