    "intro": "Tulipa lurida, commonly known as the desert tulip, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils. Its bulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive during brief periods of rainfall. Tulipa lurida is an important part of the local flora and is often found in rocky habitats and sandy soils."
