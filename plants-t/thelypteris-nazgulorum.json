    "intro": "Thelypteris nazgulorum, commonly known as the Nazgul fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous stolons, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are released from small, clustered sorus structures located on the underside of the fronds."
