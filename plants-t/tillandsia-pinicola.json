    "intro": "Tillandsia pinicola, commonly known as the pine rosette tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant native to Central America, particularly Mexico. This species is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense, water-holding structure. The leaves are typically green to bluish-green and are covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests."
