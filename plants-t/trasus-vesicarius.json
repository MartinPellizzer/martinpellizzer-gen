    "intro": "Trasus vesicarius, commonly known as the bladder snail, is a species of freshwater gastropod mollusk. It is characterized by its spiral shell, which is typically smooth and elongated. The plant-like appearance of its shell has led to its common name, though it is not a true plant. Trasus vesicarius thrives in moist environments such as ponds, streams, and damp soil. Its presence is often an indicator of clean, well-oxygenated water in its habitat."
