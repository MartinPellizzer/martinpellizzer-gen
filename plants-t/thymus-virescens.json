    "intro": "Thymus virescens, commonly known as green thyme, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and small, fragrant leaves that are rich in essential oils. The plant produces pink or purple flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on slender stems. Its leaves are widely used in culinary applications for their aromatic properties and are also valued in traditional medicine. Thymus virescens thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and herb gardens."
