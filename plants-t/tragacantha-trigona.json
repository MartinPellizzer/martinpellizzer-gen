It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a gum resin, which has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and extensive. Tragacantha trigona thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
