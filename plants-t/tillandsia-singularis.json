    "intro": "Tillandsia singularis, commonly known as the singular tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, colorful flowers that range from white to pink, often blooming in the spring. It thrives in humid environments and requires indirect sunlight, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its unique ability to absorb water through its leaves, it is well adapted to epiphytic growth on trees and rocks."
