    "intro": "Thalictrum chelidonii var. reniforme, commonly known as the broad-leaved meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves with a distinctive broad, heart-shaped base. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its elegant foliage and subtle floral display."
