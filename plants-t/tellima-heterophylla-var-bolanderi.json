    "intro": "Tellima heterophylla var. bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander\u2019s tellima, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its unique, palmately lobed leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. It has a short growing season and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
