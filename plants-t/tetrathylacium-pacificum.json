It features a rosette of blue-green, woolly leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical heads. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Due to its distinctive appearance and ecological role, it is a notable species in coastal botany."
