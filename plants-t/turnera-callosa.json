    "intro": "Turnera callosa, commonly known as the rough turnera, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a slightly rough texture, giving it its common name. Turnera callosa is often found in shaded, humid environments such as forests and along stream banks."
