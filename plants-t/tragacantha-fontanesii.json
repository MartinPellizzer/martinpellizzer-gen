    "intro": "Tragacantha fontanesii, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of its distinctive resinous gum. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The gum obtained from this plant has been traditionally used in medicine and as a natural adhesive."
