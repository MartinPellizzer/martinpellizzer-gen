    "intro": "Trigonella tibetana, commonly known as Tibetan fenugreek, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, adapting to the harsh climatic conditions of its habitat. Its seeds are often used in traditional medicine and have been studied for their potential nutritional and pharmacological properties. Trigonella tibetana plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native region and is of interest to botanists and ethnobotry researchers."
