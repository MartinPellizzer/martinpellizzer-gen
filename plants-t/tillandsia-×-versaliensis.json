    "intro": "Tillandsia \u00d7 versaliensis, commonly known as the hybrid air plant, is a species within the Bromeliaceae family. It is a epiphytic plant that thrives without soil, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. This plant is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in capturing water and light. Tillandsia \u00d7 versaliensis is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
