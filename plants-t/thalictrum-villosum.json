    "intro": "Thalictrum villosum, commonly known as the silky avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves with a soft, hairy texture that gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are typically borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Thalictrum villosum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
