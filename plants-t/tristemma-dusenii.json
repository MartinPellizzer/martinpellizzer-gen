    "intro": "Tristemma dusenii, commonly known as the Sierra dwarf mallow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of California and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often at high elevations, and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Its small, pink or white flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, and the plant produces capsule fruits containing several seeds. Tristemma dusenii is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
