    "intro": "Triorchis strictus, commonly known as the narrowleaf twayblade, is a small, herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a spike, often without a distinct scent. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Triorchis strictus is a non-photosynthetic orchid, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake."
