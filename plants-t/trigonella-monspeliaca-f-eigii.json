    "intro": "Trigonella monspeliaca f. eigii, commonly known as the Eigg trigonella, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically trifid and have a distinctive yellowish-green hue. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its fruit is a legume that splits open to release its seeds. It is native to the Scottish island of Eigg and is adapted to grow in rocky, nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
