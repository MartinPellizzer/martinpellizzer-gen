    "intro": "Taraxacum artutum, commonly known as the Artutum dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk florets, which bloom in the spring and early summer. The plant produces a distinctive, elongated seed head known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats."
