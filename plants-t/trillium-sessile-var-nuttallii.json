    "intro": "Trillium sessile var. nuttallii, commonly known as Nuttall's small-flowered trillium, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Trilliaceae family and is characterized by its three broad, waxy leaves and three white petals that are often tinged with pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It produces a single, erect stem that bears a single, showy flower, which is followed by a red or orange-red berry. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
