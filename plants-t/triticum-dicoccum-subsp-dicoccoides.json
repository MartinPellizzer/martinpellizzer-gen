    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum subsp. dicoccoides, commonly known as einkorn wheat, is an ancient grain species native to the Fertile Crescent. It is characterized by its small, hulled seeds and a high protein content compared to modern wheat varieties. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and has a short growth cycle, making it suitable for organic farming. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces spikelets that contain several florets. This subspecies is valued for its nutritional profile and is often used in traditional and health-conscious diets."
