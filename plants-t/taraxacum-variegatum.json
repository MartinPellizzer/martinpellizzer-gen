    "intro": "Taraxacum variegatum, commonly known as the variegated dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of alternate, broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves with a distinctive variegated pattern of green and white. The plant produces a single, hollow, wind-dispersed seed head, or pappus, which is a common feature among the genus Taraxacum. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. The variegated dandelion is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some areas."
