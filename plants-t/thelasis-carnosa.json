    "intro": "Thelasis carnosa, commonly known as the woolly thelasis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a woolly appearance, which helps in reducing water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a rough, textured surface. Thelasis carnosa is often grown in rock gardens or as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
