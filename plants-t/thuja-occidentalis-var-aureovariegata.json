It is characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and its striking variegated foliage, which features golden-yellow margins on bright green leaves. The plant is evergreen, with a slow growth rate, making it suitable for use as a hedge or ornamental plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. This cultivar is prized for its aesthetic appeal and its ability to provide year-round visual interest in the landscape."
