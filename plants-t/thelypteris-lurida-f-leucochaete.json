    "intro": "Thelypteris lurida f. leucochaete, commonly known as the white-stippled shield fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a leathery texture and a deep green coloration. One of its notable botanical features is the presence of white or pale stipules along the margins of the pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
