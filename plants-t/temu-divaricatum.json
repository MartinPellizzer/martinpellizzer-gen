    "intro": "Temu divaricatum, commonly known as the variable fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into narrow, spreading segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous upright stems. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
