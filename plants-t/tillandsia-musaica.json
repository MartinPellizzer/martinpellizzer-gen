    "intro": "Tillandsia musaica, commonly known as the Musaica air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect and retain moisture. Its foliage is typically gray-green with a waxy coating, adapted to absorb nutrients from the air. Tillandsia musaica thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity."
