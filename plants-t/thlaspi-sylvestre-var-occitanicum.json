    "intro": "Thlaspi sylvestre var. occitanicum, commonly known as the Occitanian cabbages, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are alternate, lobed, and often covered in a waxy coating, while its flowers are white or pale purple. This variety is distinguished by its geographic distribution and slight morphological differences from the typical T. sylvestre."
