    "intro": "Tectaria anastomosans, commonly known as the forked shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that often have a lobed or divided appearance. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring moist, shaded environments. Its rhizome is creeping and can produce both roots and new fronds. The fronds are usually evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens or natural habitats."
