    "intro": "Thalictrum foetidum var. acutilobum, commonly known as the stinking avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves with a distinctive, strongly aromatic odor when crushed. The plant produces clusters of small, white, spadix-like flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
