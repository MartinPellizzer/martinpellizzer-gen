    "intro": "Tetratome, commonly known as the four-leaf clover, is a small flowering plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which typically consist of three leaflets, though the rare four-leaf variant is highly sought after. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish or white in color. Tetratome thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns and meadows. Its cultural significance is largely tied to its symbolic association with luck and prosperity."
