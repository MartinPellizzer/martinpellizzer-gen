    "intro": "Trifolium nemorale, commonly known as wood clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Trifolium nemorale thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
