    "intro": "Trochocephalus candollei, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, showy blooms in shades of white, pink, and purple, which appear during the cooler months. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to the harsh, cold environments where it thrives. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
