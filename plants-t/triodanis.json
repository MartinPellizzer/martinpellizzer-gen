    "intro": "Triodanis, commonly known as the three-lobed bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are typically herbaceous and are characterized by their bell-shaped, often blue or violet-colored flowers. They are native to regions in the northern hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. Triodanis species often grow in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Their flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to their ecological significance."
