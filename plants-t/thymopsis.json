    "intro": "Thymopsis, commonly known as mountain thyme, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae. These plants are native to regions of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Thymopsis species are characterized by their small, aromatic leaves and showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plants typically grow as low shrubs or herbs, with a compact growth habit. Their essential oils, derived from the leaves, are used in aromatherapy and traditional medicine for their antiseptic and calming properties."
