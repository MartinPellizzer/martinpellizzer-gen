    "intro": "Tetrapollinia caerulescens, commonly known as the blue-flowered tetrapollinia, is a rare and striking plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its vivid blue petals, which are often tinged with purple, and its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that complements its colorful flowers. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Tetrapollinia caerulescens is considered a species of conservation concern."
