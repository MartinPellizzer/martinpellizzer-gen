    "intro": "Triticum turgidum var. polonicum, commonly known as Polish wheat, is a variant of wheat native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is a hexaploid species, meaning it has six sets of chromosomes, which contributes to its genetic diversity. This variety is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and loose, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers that develop into spikelets containing multiple grains. It is primarily cultivated for its high yield and adaptability to various soil conditions."
