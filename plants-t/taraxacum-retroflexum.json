    "intro": "Taraxacum retroflexum, commonly known as the retroflex dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, typically found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow flowering head that develops into a distinctive pappus-covered seed dispersal mechanism. Its flowers bloom in the spring and early summer, and the plant is perennial, often forming dense colonies. Taraxacum retroflexum is adapted to a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
