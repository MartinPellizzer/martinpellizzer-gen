    "intro": "Taraxacum lancidens, commonly known as the lanceleaf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to parts of eastern North America, this plant thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant's scientific name reflects its distinctive leaf morphology, with \"lancidens\" referring to its lanceolate leaf shape. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is often found in disturbed soils."
