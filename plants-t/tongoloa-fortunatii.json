    "intro": "Tongoloa fortunatii, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Madagascar, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rocky soil, and it requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its limited habitat and threats from habitat loss, Tongoloa fortunatii is considered endangered."
