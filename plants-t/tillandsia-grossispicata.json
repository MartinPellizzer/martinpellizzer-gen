    "intro": "Tillandsia grossispicata, commonly known as the giant spike tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces long, branching inflorescences with showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
