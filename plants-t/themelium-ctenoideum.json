    "intro": "Themelium ctenoideum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is native to regions of Central and South America. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it an invasive species in many areas outside its native range."
