    "intro": "Thuja pyramidalis var. stricta, commonly known as the Japanese thuja or Japanese white pine, is a compact, coniferous evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features narrow, dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in flat sprays, giving it a dense, pyramidal shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green female cones, which are followed by dark blue, spherical seeds. It is well-suited for rock gardens and as a specimen plant due to its slow growth and ornamental form. Thuja pyramidalis var. stricta prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a hardy addition to many gardens."
