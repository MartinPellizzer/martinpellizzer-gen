    "intro": "Turrita serpillifolia, commonly known as the woolly turrita, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Turrita serpillifolia is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
