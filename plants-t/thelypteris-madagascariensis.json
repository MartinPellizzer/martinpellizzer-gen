    "intro": "Thelypteris madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar water fern, is a species of fern native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across wetland areas. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of its fronds. Thelypteris madagascariensis plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of its native habitats."
