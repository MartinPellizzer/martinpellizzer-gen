    "intro": "Trifolium striatum subsp. tenuiflorum, commonly known as the narrow-flowered red clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a distinctive white or pale midrib. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in agriculture and traditional medicine."
