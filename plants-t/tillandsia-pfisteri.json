    "intro": "Tillandsia pfisteri, commonly known as the Pfister's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It thrives in humid, shaded environments where it attaches itself to tree branches without harming its host. The plant's rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom once in its lifetime, typically after several years of growth. Due to its unique appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is a sought-after species among bromeliad enthusiasts."
