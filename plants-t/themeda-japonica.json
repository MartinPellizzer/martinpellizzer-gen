    "intro": "Themeda japonica, commonly known as Japanese grass or Japanese bluestem, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Themeda japonica is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-maintenance turf."
