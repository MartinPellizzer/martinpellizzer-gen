    "intro": "Tetraotis paludosa, commonly known as the marsh tetraotis, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical regions. It is characterized by its herbaceous growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are usually alternate and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Tetraotis paludosa plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various small organisms."
