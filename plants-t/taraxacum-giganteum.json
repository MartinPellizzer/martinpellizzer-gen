    "intro": "Taraxacum giganteum, commonly known as the giant dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its large, spoon-shaped leaves that form a rosette near the ground. The plant produces a tall, hollow stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, topped with a single, yellow flower head. Its flowers develop into white, fluffy seed heads that are dispersed by the wind. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows."
