    "intro": "Tillandsia stenoglossa, commonly known as the narrow-lipped air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue. It is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
