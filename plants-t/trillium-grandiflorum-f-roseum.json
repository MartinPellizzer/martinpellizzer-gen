    "intro": "Trillium grandiflorum f. roseum, commonly known as the rose-flowered white trillium, is a striking variant of the white trillium native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its pale pink to rose-colored petals, which distinguish it from the typical white petals of the species. The plant features three broad, heart-shaped leaves and a single, three-lobed flower that blooms in early spring. It thrives in rich, moist woodlands and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is a popular subject in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
