    "intro": "Taraxacum boreophilum, commonly known as the Arctic dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and rosette-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its flowers are yellow and produce wind-dispersed seeds, a common trait among dandelions. Taraxacum boreophilum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and supports local insect populations."
