    "intro": "Trigastrotheca rupestris, commonly known as the rock navel orange, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, orange fruits that are edible and have a tangy flavor, similar to citrus. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, with thick stems that help it withstand harsh weather conditions. Trigastrotheca rupestris is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and adaptability to rocky soils."
