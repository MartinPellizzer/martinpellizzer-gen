It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often grow in clusters. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests or wetlands. Its leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small, lance-shaped pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. Thelypteris polyptera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its aesthetic qualities."
