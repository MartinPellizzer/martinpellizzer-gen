    "intro": "Triglochin procera var. dubia, commonly known as the slender spirea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the northern hemisphere. It features slender, upright stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are borne on short pedicels. It is typically found in marshes, fens, and other moist environments where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Triglochin procera var. dubia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting wetland biodiversity."
