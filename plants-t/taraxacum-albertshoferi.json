    "intro": "Taraxacum albertshoferi, commonly known as the Albertshofer's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seed heads, typical of the dandelion genus. It is native to Central Europe and is often found in meadows and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
