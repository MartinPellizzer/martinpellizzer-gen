    "intro": "Ternatea rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-stained fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often tinged with a reddish hue, particularly along the margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds. Ternatea rubiginosa plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
