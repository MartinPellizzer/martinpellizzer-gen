    "intro": "Tubella metamorpha, commonly known as the spiral sponge or spiral tubellarian, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the phylum Porifera. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of tube-like structures called ostia, which are used for water filtration. The body of Tubella metamorpha is typically elongated and cylindrical, with a soft, porous texture. It is found in shallow coastal waters and is often attached to substrates such as rocks or shells. This species plays an important role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling through filter feeding."
