    "intro": "Trifolium versicolor, commonly known as the variable clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that can range in color from white to pink and even purple, depending on environmental conditions. Trifolium versicolor thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. It is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides, contributing to soil nitrogen through its nitrogen-fixing ability."
