    "intro": "Taraxacum walo-kochii, commonly known as the Walo-Koch dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments. It produces a distinctive hollow stem that supports its flower, which develops into a white, fluffy seed head. The plant is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
