    "intro": "Tapinanthus buvumae, commonly known as the Buvuma dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the island of Buvuma in Kenya. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure that wraps around its host. It is notable for its unique ecological role in the region and its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
