It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically bright green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer. Anatolicum is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. It is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it a useful plant in agricultural and ecological contexts."
