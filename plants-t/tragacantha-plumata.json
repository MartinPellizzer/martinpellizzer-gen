    "intro": "Tragacantha plumata, commonly known as the fringed tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pale yellow flowers that appear in summer. The plant produces a viscous, latex-like sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a sizing agent for textiles. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Tragacantha plumata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
