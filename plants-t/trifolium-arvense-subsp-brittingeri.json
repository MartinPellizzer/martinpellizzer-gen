    "intro": "Trifolium arvense subsp. brittingeri, commonly known as Brittinger's clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinator populations."
