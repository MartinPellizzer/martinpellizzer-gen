    "intro": "Trapa borysthenica, commonly known as the European water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. The plant has floating leaves with a waxy upper surface and submerged leaves that are narrower and more elongated. Its distinctive seed pods, which resemble small shields, contain hard, spiny seeds that can remain viable in the water for extended periods. Trapa borysthenica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
