    "intro": "Taraxacum megalocarpum, commonly known as the giant dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and large, spoon-shaped basal leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces a single, tall, yellow composite flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a distinctive, elongated achene with a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. This species is notable for its large seed size and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
