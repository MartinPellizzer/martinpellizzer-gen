    "intro": "Trema nitidum, commonly known as the glossy buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are often shiny and oval in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Trema nitidum is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
