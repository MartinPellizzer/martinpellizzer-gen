    "intro": "Taraxacum aznavourii, commonly known as the Aznavour's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Eastern Mediterranean, particularly in Armenia and Turkey. This plant is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The flower head develops into a crown of white, fluffy seeds, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in rocky and semi-arid environments, often growing in open habitats with well-drained soil."
