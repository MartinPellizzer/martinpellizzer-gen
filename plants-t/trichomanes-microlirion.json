    "intro": "Trichomanes microlirion, commonly known as the narrow-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Trichomanes microlirion is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
