    "intro": "Tupistra tupistroides, commonly known as the dwarf mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
