    "intro": "Thalictrum simplex var. kemense, commonly known as the Kemensh thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, actinomorphic flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, leafless stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and subtle floral display."
