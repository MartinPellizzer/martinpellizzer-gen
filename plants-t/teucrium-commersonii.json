It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid regions. Teucrium commersonii is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
