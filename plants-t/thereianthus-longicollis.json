    "intro": "Thereianthus longicollis, commonly known as the long-necked orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and large, showy flowers that often display a mix of white, pink, and purple hues. The plant typically grows in cool, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its unique floral structure and habitat preferences make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
