    "intro": "Taraxacum officinale subsp. aquilonare, commonly known as the European dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flowering head. It produces composite flowers that transition from yellow to white as they mature, with the characteristic \"puffball\" seeds dispersing via the wind. The plant is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, and it thrives in a variety of soil types, including disturbed and urban environments. It is known for its medicinal properties, including diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects. The subspecies aquilonare is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other dandelion subspecies."
