    "intro": "Thymelaea virescens, commonly known as the green thymelaea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, featuring small, evergreen leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive. The species is also noted for its ability to tolerate drought conditions once established."
