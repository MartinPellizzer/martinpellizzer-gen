    "intro": "Thelypteris walkeri, commonly known as the walking fern, is a species of fern characterized by its unique, upright growth habit and its ability to form dense clumps. It has feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and can reach lengths of up to 60 centimeters. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups. Thelypteris walkeri is native to tropical and subtropical regions and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently."
