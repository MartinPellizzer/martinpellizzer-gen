    "intro": "Tillandsia candelifera, commonly known as the candleplant, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup to collect water. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits. Tillandsia candelifera is popular among collectors for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
