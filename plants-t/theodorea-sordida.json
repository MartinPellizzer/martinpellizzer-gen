    "intro": "Theodorea sordida, commonly known as the dirty lily, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the dense, humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent petals and its unique ability to thrive in low-light conditions. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Its flowers emit a faint, earthy fragrance, which attracts specific pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Theodorea sordida is considered a vulnerable species."
