    "intro": "Trifolium arvense var. gracile, commonly known as slender field clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, appearing in early spring. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and fields. This variety is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
