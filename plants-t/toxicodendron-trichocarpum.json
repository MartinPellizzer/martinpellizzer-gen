    "intro": "Toxicodendron trichocarpum, commonly known as the Chinese lacquer tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and alternate, simple leaves that are usually elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its sap, known as lac, has been historically used in traditional crafts and as a protective coating. However, the plant contains urushiol, which can cause severe allergic reactions in humans."
