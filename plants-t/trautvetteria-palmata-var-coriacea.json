It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are thick and rough to the touch, giving it its varietal name \"coriacea,\" meaning \"wood-like\" in Latin. Its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers are typically pink or red, and they bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments."
