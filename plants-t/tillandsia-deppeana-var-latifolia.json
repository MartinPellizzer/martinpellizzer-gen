    "intro": "Tillandsia deppeana var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are broad and often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant thrives in humid environments and requires indirect sunlight to prevent leaf burn. It produces striking inflorescences with showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer or early fall. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
