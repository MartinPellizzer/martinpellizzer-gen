    "intro": "Tillandsia malyi, commonly known as the Maly's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Tillandsia malyi is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth."
