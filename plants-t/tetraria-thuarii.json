    "intro": "Tetraria thuarii, commonly known as the desert lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, particularly in regions with high sunlight exposure. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the fungal and algal components. It is typically found growing on rocks, soil, or other substrates in deserts and dry climates. Tetraria thuarii plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other desert organisms."
