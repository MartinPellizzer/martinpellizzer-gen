    "intro": "Trisetum bifidum, commonly known as the bifid feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm in width. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, which are usually wind-pollinated. Trisetum bifidum thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and sandy soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
