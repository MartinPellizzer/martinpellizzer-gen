It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, edible pulp. Tococa cordata is often found in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
