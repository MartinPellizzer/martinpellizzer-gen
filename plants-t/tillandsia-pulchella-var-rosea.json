    "intro": "Tillandsia pulchella var. rosea, commonly known as the pink air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its striking pink or red flowers appear in the center of the rosette, adding to its ornamental value. This variety is popular among plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
