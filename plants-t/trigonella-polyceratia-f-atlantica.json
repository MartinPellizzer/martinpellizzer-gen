The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or coastal environments. Its botanical features include stipulate leaves and a hairy stem, which help it adapt to arid conditions. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological traits and ecological adaptations."
