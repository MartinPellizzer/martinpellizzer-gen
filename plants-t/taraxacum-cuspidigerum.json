    "intro": "Taraxacum cuspidigerum, commonly known as the bristled dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of rough, bristled leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a pappus-equipped seed head. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant is known for its ability to spread via wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its widespread distribution. Its botanical features make it a common weed in gardens and natural areas."
