    "intro": "Taraxacum longe-caudatum, commonly known as the long-tailed dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of elongated, hairy leaves and a long, slender stem that supports a single, showy yellow flower head. The flower develops into a distinctive spherical seed head with parachute-like seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and sunny habitats. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological studies and horticultural interest."
