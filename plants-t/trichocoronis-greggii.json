    "intro": "Trichocoronis greggii, commonly known as Gregg's dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and a single, showy yellow flower that blooms in the spring. The plant produces a capsule containing numerous tiny seeds with tufts of white hair, which aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Trichocoronis greggii is an important plant for pollinators and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
