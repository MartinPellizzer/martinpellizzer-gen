    "intro": "Trollius humilis, commonly known as the meadow buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a white downy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Trollius humilis is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and is also an important nectar source for pollinators."
