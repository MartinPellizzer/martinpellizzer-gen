    "intro": "Tripleurospermum rupestre, commonly known as the rock everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
