    "intro": "Triptilion cordifolium, commonly known as the heartleaf triptilon, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features basal leaves that are heart-shaped, giving it its common name, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
