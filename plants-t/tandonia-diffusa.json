    "intro": "Tandonia diffusa, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique species belonging to the family Tandoniaceae. It is a non-photosynthetic plant that relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically growing on the surface of other plants. The plant is characterized by its translucent, leaf-like structures that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It is often found in shaded, humid environments, such as rainforests. Due to its specialized growth habits, Tandonia diffusa is considered rare and has limited geographic distribution."
