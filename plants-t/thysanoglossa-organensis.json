    "intro": "Thysanoglossa organensis, commonly known as the Organ Mountains orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the Organ Mountains in New Mexico. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has a short, underground rhizome and produces small, green leaves that are adapted to the arid environment. Its flowers are usually pale pink or white with intricate patterns, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited habitat and threats from climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species."
