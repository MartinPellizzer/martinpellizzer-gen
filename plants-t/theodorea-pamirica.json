    "intro": "Theodorea pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are usually unbranched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
