    "intro": "Teucrium genevense, commonly known as the Geneva germander, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its aromatic foliage and compact growth habit make it a useful ornamental plant in gardens. It is also valued for its medicinal properties, though it is less commonly cultivated than other members of the Geraniaceae family."
