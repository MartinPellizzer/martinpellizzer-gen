    "intro": "Trisetum sericeum, commonly known as silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its inflorescence consists of a slender, spike-like cluster of small, greenish flowers. Trisetum sericeum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
