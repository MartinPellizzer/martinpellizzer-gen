    "intro": "Tachigali subbullata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or tachigali, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its hard, dark wood, it has been historically valued for furniture and musical instruments."
