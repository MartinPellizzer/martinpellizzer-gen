    "intro": "Tillandsia decumbens, commonly known as the groundhugging air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid and shaded environments. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale purple flowers. It is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
