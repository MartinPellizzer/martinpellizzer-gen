    "intro": "Taxus brevifolia subsp. reptaneta, commonly known as the Japanese yew, is a rare and endangered subspecies native to Japan. It is a slow-growing evergreen conifer with dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
