    "intro": "Tripogandra multiflora, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a perennial flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its fibrous, strap-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure and strong winds. It is often found in dune environments and plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Tripogandra multiflora is also valued for its historical use in the production of fiber for textiles."
