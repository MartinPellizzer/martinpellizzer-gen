    "intro": "Thelypteris angustipinna, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant produces small, sporangia-bearing sori on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in rows. Thelypteris angustipinna thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
