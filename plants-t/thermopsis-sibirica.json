    "intro": "Thermopsis sibirica, commonly known as Siberian thermopsis, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with compound leaves and a taproot system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance in its native habitat. Thermopsis sibirica is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
