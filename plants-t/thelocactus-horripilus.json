    "intro": "Thelocactus horripilus, commonly known as the devil's hairpin cactus, is a species native to the deserts of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white, woolly spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise stark appearance. It is well adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in extreme drought conditions. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
