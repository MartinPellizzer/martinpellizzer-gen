    "intro": "Terpsichore diaphana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers and lacks leaves, relying entirely on its roots for nutrients. The plant is epiphytic, growing on the bark of trees rather than in soil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique structure and limited distribution make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern. Due to habitat destruction, Terpsichore diaphana is listed as an endangered species in many regions."
