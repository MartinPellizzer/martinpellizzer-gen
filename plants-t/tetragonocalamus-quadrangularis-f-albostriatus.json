    "intro": "Tetragonocalamus quadrangularis f. albostriatus, commonly known as the white-striped bamboo, is a unique variant of the quadrangular bamboo species. It is characterized by its distinctive white longitudinal stripes on the culms, which contrast sharply with its green base color. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It has a slender, cylindrical stem with a square cross-section, typical of the genus Tetragonocalamus. This ornamental bamboo is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
