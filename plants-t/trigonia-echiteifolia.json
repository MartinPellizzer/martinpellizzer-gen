    "intro": "Trigonia echiteifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
