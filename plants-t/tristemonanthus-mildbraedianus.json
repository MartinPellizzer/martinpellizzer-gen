    "intro": "Tristemonanthus mildbraedianus, commonly known as the mildbraedian starflower, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. It has slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
