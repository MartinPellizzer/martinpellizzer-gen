It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a central disk that resembles the sun, giving it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, seed-filled flowers that are adapted for wind pollination. Trasus flavus thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a hardy species suitable for dry climates. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a popular choice for xeriscaping."
