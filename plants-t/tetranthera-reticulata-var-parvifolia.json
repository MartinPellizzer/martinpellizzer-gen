    "intro": "Tetranthera reticulata var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves contain irritant chemicals, similar to other members of the Urticaceae family, and are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
