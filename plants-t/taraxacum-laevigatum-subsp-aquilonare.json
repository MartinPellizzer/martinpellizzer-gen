    "intro": "Taraxacum laevigatum subsp. aquilonare, commonly known as the western dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to western North America. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a smooth, waxy texture. The plant produces a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, showy yellow flower head composed of numerous ray florets. After flowering, it develops a distinctive seed head with pappus-equipped seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. This species is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows."
