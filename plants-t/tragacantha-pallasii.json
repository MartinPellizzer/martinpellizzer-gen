    "intro": "Tragacantha pallasii, commonly known as the Persian gum or Astragalus pallasii, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces a viscous, yellowish resin known as tragacanth, which has been used historically in medicine and as a thickening agent. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Tragacantha pallasii is valued for its ecological role and traditional uses, though it is relatively rare and protected in some areas."
