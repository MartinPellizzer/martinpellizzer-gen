    "intro": "Tovomita trojitana, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a distinguishing feature. Tovomita trojitana plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
