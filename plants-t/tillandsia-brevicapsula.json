    "intro": "Tillandsia brevicapsula, commonly known as the short-capped air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
