    "intro": "Trichilia moschata var. odorata, commonly known as the fragrant African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark that emits a pleasant scent when crushed. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by elliptical, leathery fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and useful timber, it is sometimes cultivated for both aesthetic and economic purposes."
