    "intro": "Tithymalus floridanus, commonly known as the Florida tithymalus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
