    "intro": "Tillandsia funckiana, commonly known as the Funck's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant possesses rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking white to pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
