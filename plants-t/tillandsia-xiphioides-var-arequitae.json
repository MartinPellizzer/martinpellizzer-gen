    "intro": "Tillandsia xiphioides var. arequitae, commonly known as the Arequipa air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage forms a rosette structure that collects water and nutrients from the environment. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
