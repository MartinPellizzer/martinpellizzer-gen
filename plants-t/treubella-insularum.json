    "intro": "Treubella insularum, commonly known as the island treubella, is a rare and endemic fern species found primarily in tropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through sexual means. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Treubella insularum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
