    "intro": "Thesium diffusum, commonly known as the common thesium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in loose panicles and bloom in late spring to early summer. Thesium diffusum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
