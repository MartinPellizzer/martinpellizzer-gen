    "intro": "Trachelanthus korolkowii, commonly known as the silverleaf tree or silverleaf bush, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white coating, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in spring. Trachelanthus korolkowii is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
