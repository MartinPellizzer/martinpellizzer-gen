    "intro": "Thelypteris thailandica, commonly known as the Thai shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky substrates. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris thailandica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
