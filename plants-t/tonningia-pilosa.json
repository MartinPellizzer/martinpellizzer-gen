    "intro": "Tonningia pilosa, commonly known as the hairy tonningia, is a climbing epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It features a distinctive appearance with long, slender rhizomes and finely divided, pinnate leaves that are covered in soft, hairy textures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on trees in rainforests. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores for propagation. Tonningia pilosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to add texture to shaded garden spaces."
