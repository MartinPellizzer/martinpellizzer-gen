    "intro": "Taraxacum fibratum, commonly known as the fibrous dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. After flowering, it develops a distinctive, hairy, spherical seed head that disperses seeds via the wind. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils."
