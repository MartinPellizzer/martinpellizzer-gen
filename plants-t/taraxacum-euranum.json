It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flowering head. The plant produces bright yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seed heads, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed areas. Taraxacum euranum is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its diuretic and digestive benefits."
