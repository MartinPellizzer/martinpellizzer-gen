    "intro": "Taraxacum leopardinum, commonly known as the leopard dandelion, is a rare and distinctive species of flowering plant in the sunflower family. It is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and a bright yellow flower head that resembles a dandelion. The plant is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in moist meadows and woodland edges. Its scientific name reflects its unique leaf pattern, which resembles a leopard's spots. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
