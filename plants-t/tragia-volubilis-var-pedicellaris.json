    "intro": "Tragia volubilis var. pedicellaris, commonly known as the hairy devil's backbone, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense inflorescences, while the fruit is a capsule containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed habitats and is often found in disturbed soils near rivers or in open forests. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
