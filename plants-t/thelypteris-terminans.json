    "intro": "Thelypteris terminans, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds that are typically green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris terminans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its lush, fern-like appearance."
