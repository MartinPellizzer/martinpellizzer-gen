    "intro": "Theodorea neglecta, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Theodorea neglecta is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
