It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and spikelet-based inflorescence, with each spikelet containing multiple small, two-lobed flowers. The plant produces hard, glume-enclosed grains that are rich in carbohydrates and proteins. Its genome is complex, consisting of multiple subgenomes due to hybridization events during evolution. This variety is widely cultivated for its high yield and nutritional value, making it a staple in global agriculture."
