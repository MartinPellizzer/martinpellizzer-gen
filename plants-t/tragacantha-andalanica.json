    "intro": "Tragacantha andalanica, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Iran and Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, corky bark and small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. It is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and withstand extreme temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. The plant is also valued for its gum, which has been used historically in various traditional applications."
