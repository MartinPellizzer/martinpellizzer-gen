    "intro": "Trachydium rockii, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a member of the Lecanorales order and is characterized by its unique thallus structure. It typically grows on rocky surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments, forming a crust-like growth that adheres tightly to the substrate. The plant's morphology includes a leathery, dark-colored cortex with a finely branched medulla, which helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. It is often found in regions with low humidity and high solar exposure, such as mountainous areas and deserts. Trachydium rockii plays a vital ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
