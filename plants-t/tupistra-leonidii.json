    "intro": "Tupistra leonidii, commonly known as the Leonidii's tufted plant, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features dense, compact growth with fleshy, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically small, thick, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Tupistra leonidii is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
