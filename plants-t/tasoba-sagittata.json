    "intro": "Tasoba sagittata, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and have a waxy surface. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface. It thrives in shallow, still waters and is often used in water gardens. Its rapid growth makes it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
