    "intro": "Triplocentron, commonly known as the three-veined plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique tri-venation pattern in the leaves, where three distinct veins run from the base to the tip. The genus includes several species, such as Triplocentron sinense, which is native to Asia. These plants typically have hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. They are often found in moist, shaded environments and are valued for their ornamental qualities."
