    "intro": "Taraxacum multidenticulatum, commonly known as the multidentate dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, showy yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head composed of numerous small, parachute-like seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
