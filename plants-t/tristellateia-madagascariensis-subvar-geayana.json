    "intro": "Tristellateia madagascariensis subvar. geayana, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a striking orchid species native to Madagascar. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with a single, showy flower that blooms in a striking blue or purple hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are characterized by a unique star-shaped lip and are pollinated by specific insect species. This subvariety is prized for its ornamental value and is a subject of interest in botanical research due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
