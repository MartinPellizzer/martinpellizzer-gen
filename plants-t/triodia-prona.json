    "intro": "Triodia prona, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native fauna. Triodia prona is also known for its ability to form extensive, low-lying vegetation known as spinifex plains."
