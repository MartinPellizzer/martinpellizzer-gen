    "intro": "Tillandsia mitlaensis var. tulensis, commonly known as the Tulens Island airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, colorful flowers that are typically pink or red, adding visual interest to its appearance. This variety is valued for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
