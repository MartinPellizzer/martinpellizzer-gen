    "intro": "Tillandsia fusiformis, commonly known as the fusiform air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's unique structure consists of a tall, narrow rosette of leaves that form a central cup to collect water. Its leaves are typically dark green and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. Tillandsia fusiformis is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
