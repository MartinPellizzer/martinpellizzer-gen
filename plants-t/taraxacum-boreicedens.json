    "intro": "Taraxacum boreicedens, commonly known as the Arctic dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves and a tall, slender stem that bears a single yellow flower head. The plant is adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and flies, contributing to its reproductive success. Taraxacum boreicedens plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is an indicator species for tundra ecosystems."
