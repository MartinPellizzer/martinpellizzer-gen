    "intro": "Thesium humifusum, commonly known as the sand thistle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It typically features a mat-like growth habit with wiry, branching stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Thesium humifusum is often found in sandy soils and is considered a hardy species suitable for coastal and drought-prone areas."
