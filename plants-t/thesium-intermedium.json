    "intro": "Thesium intermedium, commonly known as the common thesium, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant features upright, branched stems covered in fine hairs, and its small, yellowish-green flowers are arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Thesium intermedium produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves and is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability to harsh environments."
