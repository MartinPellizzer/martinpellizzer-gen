    "intro": "Trichomanes cocos, commonly known as the coconut fern, is a member of the water fern family, Polypodiaceae. It is a tropical plant characterized by its pinnately compound fronds that resemble the leaves of a fern. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping underground stems that produce new shoots. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of its fronds. Trichomanes cocos is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in humid forests."
