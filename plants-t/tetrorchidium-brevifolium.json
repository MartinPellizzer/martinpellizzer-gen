    "intro": "Tetrorchidium brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved tetrorchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers during the late spring or early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
