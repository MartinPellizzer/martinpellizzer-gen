It features compound leaves with a distinctive reddish or orange coloration, often with a velvety texture due to its dense pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It is adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in such conditions. The plant is also noted for its potential use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
