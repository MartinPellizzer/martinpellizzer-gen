    "intro": "Tetrapterys stipulacea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
