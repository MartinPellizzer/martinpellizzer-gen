    "intro": "Taraxacum medioximum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are typically rough and hairy, with a deep green color. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that supports a flowering head composed of numerous small yellow flowers. After flowering, it develops a distinctive seed head known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings."
