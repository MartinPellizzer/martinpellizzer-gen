    "intro": "Timotocia chamaedryfolia, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Timotocia chamaedryfolia is adapted to withstand drought and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
