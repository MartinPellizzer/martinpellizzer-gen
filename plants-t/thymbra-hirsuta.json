    "intro": "Thymbra hirsuta, commonly known as hairy thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, small, oval-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or violet flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, are used in aromatherapy and traditional medicine for their calming and antiseptic properties."
