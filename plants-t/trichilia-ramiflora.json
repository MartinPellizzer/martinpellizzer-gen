    "intro": "Trichilia ramiflora, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other valuable hardwoods. The tree is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically white or yellow and appear in clusters, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. The wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, though it is also used in traditional medicine."
