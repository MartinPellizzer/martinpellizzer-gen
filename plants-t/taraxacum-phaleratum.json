    "intro": "Taraxacum phaleratum, commonly known as the meadow dandelion, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a long, hollow stem that bears a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces numerous seeds enclosed in a distinctive, parachute-like structure called a pappus. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and pastures. Taraxacum phaleratum is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects."
