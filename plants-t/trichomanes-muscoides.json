It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance. The plant has rhizomes that form dense mats, and its leaves are typically narrow and elongated. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Trichomanes muscoides is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions."
