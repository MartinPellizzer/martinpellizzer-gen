    "intro": "Tectaria palmata, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in clusters known as sori. Tectaria palmata thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in tropical ecosystems."
