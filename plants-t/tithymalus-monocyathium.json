    "intro": "Tithymalus monocyathium, commonly known as the single-capsule tithymalus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels. The plant produces a single, elongated fruit that contains a single seed, a feature that distinguishes it from other species in the genus. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
