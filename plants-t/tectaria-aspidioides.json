    "intro": "Tectaria aspidioides, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. Tectaria aspidioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
