    "intro": "Therofon vancouverense, commonly known as the Vancouver therofon, is a rare flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate rainforests. Its flowers, which bloom in early spring, are typically pale pink to white in color. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
