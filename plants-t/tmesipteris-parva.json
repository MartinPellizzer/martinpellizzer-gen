    "intro": "Tmesipteris parva, commonly known as the small fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to parts of Asia and Australia. It belongs to the family Tmesipteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces small, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Tmesipteris parva thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in forest understories."
