    "intro": "Thecophyllum acuminatum, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It possesses small, bladder-like structures called bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and has delicate, branching stems covered in tiny leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often green or yellowish in color. Thecophyllum acuminatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling populations of microscopic organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling."
