    "intro": "Terminalia spekei, commonly known as African snowball, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The tree produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for reforestation projects."
