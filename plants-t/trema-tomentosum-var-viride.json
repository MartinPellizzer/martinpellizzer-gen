    "intro": "Trema tomentosum var. viride, commonly known as the green velvetwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it a soft, moss-like appearance. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they turn vibrant shades of red or orange during the autumn season. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. This plant is often valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping for its unique texture and seasonal color changes."
