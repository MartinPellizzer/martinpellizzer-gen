    "intro": "Taraxacum saevum, commonly known as the devil's lettuce, is a species of dandelion native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its robust, upright stem and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, yellow flower head that develops into a distinctive, spiky seed sphere. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it both a common weed and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
