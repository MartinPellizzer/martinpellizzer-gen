    "intro": "Trema rugosum, commonly known as the roughleaf ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in small, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by dark blue, edible berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
