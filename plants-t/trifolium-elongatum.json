It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Trifolium elongatum is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
