    "intro": "Trifolium neurophyllum, commonly known as the alpine clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. It is adapted to cold climates and has a low-growing habit to withstand harsh weather conditions. Trifolium neurophyllum plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
