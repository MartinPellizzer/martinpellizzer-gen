    "intro": "Talisia carinata f. sericea, commonly known as the velvetleaf talisia, is a botanical variant of the species Talisia carinata. It is characterized by its finely pubescent leaves, which give the plant a velvety texture. The plant is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often clustered in terminal panicles, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind."
