    "intro": "Triticum carthlicum, commonly known as wild rye, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, narrow leaves, which are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous\u9896 (glumes) and florets, which contain the seeds. Triticum carthlicum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields. It has been used historically for forage and in traditional medicine due to its hardy nature and nutritional value."
