    "intro": "Tsuga douglasii var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping Douglas fir, is a variant of the Douglas fir characterized by its cascading, drooping branches. This evergreen conifer is native to the western United States, particularly in moist, cool mountainous regions. Its foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, providing a dense, soft texture. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain edible seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique, flowing form."
