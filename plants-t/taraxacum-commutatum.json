    "intro": "Taraxacum commutatum, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. Its flowers typically bloom in early spring and are followed by a distinctive, pappus-equipped seed dispersal mechanism. This species is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in rocky or gravelly soils."
