    "intro": "Toiyabea alpina, commonly known as the alpine toiyabea, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high elevations of the Great Basin in North America. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions such as strong winds and low temperatures. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are densely packed, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Toiyabea alpina plays an important ecological role in its alpine habitat, supporting pollinators and contributing to soil stability."
