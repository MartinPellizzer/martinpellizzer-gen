    "intro": "Thelypteris glanduligera var. puberula, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern genus characterized by its distinctive fronds. It typically has a short, creeping rhizome and produces fertile fronds that are usually shorter than the sterile ones. The fronds are bipinnate, with a dense covering of fine hairs, giving the plant its \"hairy\" appearance. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
