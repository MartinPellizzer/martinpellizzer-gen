It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Thelypteris wenzhouensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and limited distribution."
