    "intro": "Tamarix canariensis, commonly known as the Canary rose or sea rose, is a shrub or small tree native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to arid and coastal environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
