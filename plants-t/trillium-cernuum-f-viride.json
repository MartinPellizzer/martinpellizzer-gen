    "intro": "Trillium cernuum f. viride, commonly known as the green-flowered trillium, is a rare and striking plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Trilliaceae family and is characterized by its three broad, waxy leaves and three greenish-white petals. The plant typically blooms in early spring, with its flowers often positioned downward, a trait that distinguishes it from other trillium species. Its foliage and floral structure reflect adaptations to forest understory conditions, where it thrives in partial shade and moist, acidic soils. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered an indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
