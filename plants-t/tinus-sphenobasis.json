It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered along the branches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color, arranged in clusters. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in coastal and inland regions with well-drained soils. Tinus sphenobasis is adapted to tolerate drought and salt, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
