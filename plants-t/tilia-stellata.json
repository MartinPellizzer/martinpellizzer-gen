    "intro": "Tilia stellata, commonly known as the star-leaf lime or starleaf linden, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed and have a star-like appearance, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are followed by small, round fruits. Tilia stellata prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
