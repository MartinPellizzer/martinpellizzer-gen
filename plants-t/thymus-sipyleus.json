    "intro": "Thymus sipyleus, commonly known as Sipylean thyme, is a perennial herb native to Turkey and parts of the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, small, oval-shaped leaves that are densely packed on square stems. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in the spring, which are clustered in terminal spikes. Thymus sipyleus is often found in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun. It is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, similar to other thyme species."
