    "intro": "Taraxacum distantijugum, commonly known as the distant-jugate dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow flowering head that develops into a white pappus for wind dispersal. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a taproot system and is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. The species is closely related to other dandelion species but is distinguished by its unique leaf and flower morphology."
