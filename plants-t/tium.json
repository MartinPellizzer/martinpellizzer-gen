    "intro": "Tium, commonly known as the African violets, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical regions of Africa. These plants are characterized by their velvety, waxy leaves and showy, colorful flowers that bloom in shades of purple, pink, and white. Tium species are typically small, compact plants that thrive in humid, well-draining soil conditions. They are popular houseplants due to their ease of care and ability to bloom frequently throughout the year. The leaves are often heart-shaped and can vary in size depending on the specific species."
