It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of mint plants, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Trichogonia menthifolia is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its aromatic foliage and ornamental appeal."
