    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 jucunda, commonly known as the small-leaf linden, is a hybrid deciduous tree belonging to the Tiliaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of its parent species, Tilia cordata and Tilia europaea. The tree produces fragrant, white flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and attract pollinators such as bees. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil types."
