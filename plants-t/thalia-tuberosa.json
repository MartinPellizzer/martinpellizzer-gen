    "intro": "Thalia tuberosa, commonly known as the marsh mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a thick, fleshy root system that stores nutrients and water, allowing it to thrive in moist environments. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is often found in association with other wetland flora. Thalia tuberosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
