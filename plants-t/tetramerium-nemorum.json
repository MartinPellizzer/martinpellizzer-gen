    "intro": "Tetramerium nemorum, commonly known as the alpine tetramerium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories at high altitudes. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that disperses seeds through wind or animal activity."
