    "intro": "Trifolium incarnatum var. atropurpureum, commonly known as purple clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically purple-tinged, and small white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. This variety is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to well-drained soils. It plays an important role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in forage agriculture."
