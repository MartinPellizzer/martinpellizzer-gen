    "intro": "[WRONG START] Tephrosia aurantiica f. cinerea, commonly known as the pale tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with stipules. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its pale, almost whitish leaves distinguish it from other varieties of Tephrosia. The species is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
