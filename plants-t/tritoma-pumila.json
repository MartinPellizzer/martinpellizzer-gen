    "intro": "Tritoma pumila, commonly known as the dwarf tritoma, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant typically grows close to the ground, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help it retain heat in cold climates. Its flowers are small and usually pink or white, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. Tritoma pumila is adapted to harsh environments, with a short growing season and the ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils."
