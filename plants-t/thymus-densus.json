    "intro": "Thymus densus, commonly known as dense thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic, often fragrant foliage. The plant features small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically small, oval, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its dense, compact growth habit. Dense thyme is often used in culinary applications and traditional medicine due to its aromatic compounds."
