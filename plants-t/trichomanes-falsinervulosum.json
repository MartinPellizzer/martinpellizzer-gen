    "intro": "Trichomanes falsinervulosum, commonly known as the false narrow-veined holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
