    "intro": "Triticum martius, commonly known as the Martian wheat, is a rare and lesser-known species within the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender stalks and small, spikelet-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, Triticum martius is of interest to botanists and researchers studying plant resilience in extreme climates."
