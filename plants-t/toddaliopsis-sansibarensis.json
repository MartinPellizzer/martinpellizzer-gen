    "intro": "Toddaliopsis sansibarensis, commonly known as the Zanzibar star grass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and maritime environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
