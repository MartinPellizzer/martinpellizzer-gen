    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. fringillarum, commonly known as the fringed wheat, is a variant of common wheat characterized by its distinctive fringed or lobed leaf margins. It is a grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stems and spike-like inflorescences bearing small,\u9896\u679c-like grains. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both agricultural and ecological studies. The fringed leaves are a key distinguishing trait that sets it apart from other wheat varieties."
