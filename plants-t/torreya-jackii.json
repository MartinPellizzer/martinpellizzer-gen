    "intro": "Torreya jackii, commonly known as the Chinese torreya, is a rare evergreen conifer native to southern China. It belongs to the family Taxaceae, which includes other yew-like plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and produces small, red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Torreya jackii is considered endangered and is of interest for conservation efforts."
