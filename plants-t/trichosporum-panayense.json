    "intro": "Trichosporum panayense, commonly known as the Panay velvet tangle, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on the island of Panay in the Philippines. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically within forest understories. Its leaves are broad and have a unique waxy texture, which helps in retaining moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichosporum panayense is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
