It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine, white pubescence. Thymelaea tomentosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
