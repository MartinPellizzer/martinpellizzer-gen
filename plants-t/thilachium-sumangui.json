    "intro": "Thilachium sumangui, commonly known as the Sumangui orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found in the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a unique scent that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
