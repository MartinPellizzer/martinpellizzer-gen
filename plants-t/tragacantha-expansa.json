    "intro": "Tragacantha expansa, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems, narrow leaves, and the production of a sticky resin known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowering period typically occurs in spring, producing small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes."
