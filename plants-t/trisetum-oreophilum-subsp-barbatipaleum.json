    "intro": "Trisetum oreophilum subsp. barbatipaleum, commonly known as the hairy-leaved wood rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver or gray. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
