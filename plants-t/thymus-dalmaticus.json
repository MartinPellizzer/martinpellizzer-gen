    "intro": "Thymus dalmaticus, commonly known as Dalmatian thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features dense, aromatic foliage with small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its creeping growth habit and ability to form compact mats. Its leaves are typically gray-green and emit a strong thyme scent when crushed. It is well-suited for rock gardens and dry, well-drained soils."
