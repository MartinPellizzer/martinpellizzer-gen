    "intro": "Turbinicarpus pseudomacrochele var. krainzianus, commonly known as the Krainzianus Turbinicarpus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and often covered in a layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts and collectors."
