    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum var. farrum, commonly known as hulless barley, is a variety of barley characterized by its lack of a hull, which allows for easier processing. It is a hexaploid species native to the Fertile Crescent and has been cultivated for thousands of years. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stems and spikelets that bear small, pale yellow grains. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a compact panicle inflorescence. The botanical features of this variety make it valuable for both traditional and modern agricultural applications."
