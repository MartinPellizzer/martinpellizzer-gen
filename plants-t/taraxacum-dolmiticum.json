    "intro": "Taraxacum dolmiticum, commonly known as the Dolmitic dandelion, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a hollow, hollow-stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower. It thrives in rocky and calcareous soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
