It is characterized by its thick, fleshy fruits that are typically orange to red in color when mature. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects, leading to the development of its unique fruit structure. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in warm, sunny environments with well-drained soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and mild flavor, making it suitable for both garden cultivation and culinary use."
