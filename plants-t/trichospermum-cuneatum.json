    "intro": "Trichospermum cuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf trichospermum, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, simple leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It is often found in moist, shady environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Trichospermum cuneatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage."
