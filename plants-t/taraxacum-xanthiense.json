    "intro": "Taraxacum xanthiense, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a distinctive hollow, hairless stem that rises from the center of the rosette. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single, short inflorescence at the top of the stem. Taraxacum xanthiense is native to Central Asia and is often found in meadows and dry grasslands."
