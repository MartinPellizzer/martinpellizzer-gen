    "intro": "Trapa kasachstanica, commonly known as the Kazakhstan water shield, is a species of aquatic plant native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically in late summer. Its fruit is a three-lobed, flat seed case that floats on the water, aiding in seed dispersal. Trapa kasachstanica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
