    "intro": "Trigonella balansae f. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited fenugreek, is a rare plant species characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is known for its leguminous plants, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to specific regions in the Middle East and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its fruits are small pods containing minute seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice in some cuisines. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
