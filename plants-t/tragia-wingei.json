    "intro": "Tragia wingei, commonly known as the redroot tragia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant characterized by its branched stems and small, often hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. Tragia wingei is adapted to arid environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural areas."
