    "intro": "Tribulus fisheri, commonly known as the coastal tribulus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, adapting to saline and well-drained conditions. Its fruits are small, three-lobed capsules that contain several seeds. Tribulus fisheri is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
