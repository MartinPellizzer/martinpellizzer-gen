    "intro": "Thelypteris linearis, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its slender, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that produce new shoots. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. Thelypteris linearis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas."
