    "intro": "Toxicodendron elongata, commonly known as the longleaf poison ivy, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three leaflets, often arranged in a zigzag pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and red, fuzzy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves contain urushiol, an oily resin that can cause severe skin irritation and allergic reactions. Toxicodendron elongata is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks."
