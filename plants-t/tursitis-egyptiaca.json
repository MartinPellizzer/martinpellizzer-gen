    "intro": "Tursitis egyptiaca, commonly known as the Egyptian thornapple, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Egypt and the Middle East. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces showy purple or blue flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit, a fleshy berry, contains seeds that are dispersed by animals. However, the plant is toxic to humans and livestock, containing alkaloids that can cause severe illness if ingested."
