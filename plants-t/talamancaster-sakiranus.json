    "intro": "Talamancaster sakiranus, commonly known as the golden mist fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the humid rainforests of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that emit a subtle golden sheen under sunlight. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity and well-draining, acidic soil to flourish. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangium, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, aiding in its reproduction. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
