This perennial plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. It thrives in well-drained soils and is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, enriching the soil. Trifolium sabuletorum is also valued for its role in ecological systems and as a forage crop for livestock."
