    "intro": "Tutcheria kweichowensis, commonly known as the Yunnan tutcheria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of silky hair, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Tutcheria kweichowensis is often found in moist, shaded environments and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
