    "intro": "Telmissa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with prominent red stamens, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Telmissa is native to Central and South America but has been introduced to other tropical regions. It is often found in disturbed habitats, such as roadsides and agricultural fields."
