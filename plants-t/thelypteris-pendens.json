    "intro": "Thelypteris pendens, commonly known as the hanging shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that often hang from trees or shrubs, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are arranged in a feather-like pattern. Thelypteris pendens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks."
