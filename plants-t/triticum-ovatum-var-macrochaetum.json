    "intro": "Triticum ovatum var. macrochaetum, commonly known as the long-haired wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves with long, stiff hairs along the margins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
