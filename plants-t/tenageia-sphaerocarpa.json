    "intro": "Tenageia sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe-fruit, is a rare and unique plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its distinctive spherical fruit, which resembles a small, smooth orange ball. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tenageia sphaerocarpa is considered a rare and endangered species."
