    "intro": "Tragopogon xanthantherus, commonly known as the yellow goatherb, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by a distinctive bristled seed head. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Tragopogon xanthantherus is also known for its ability to hybridize with other Tragopogon species, contributing to the genetic diversity within the genus."
