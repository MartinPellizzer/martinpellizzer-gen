It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive seed heads that produce wind-dispersed seeds. The plant has deeply lobed, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological studies and traditional herbal medicine."
