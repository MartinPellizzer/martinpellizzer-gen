    "intro": "Taraxacum speciosiflorum, commonly known as the showy dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern China and is characterized by its bright yellow flower heads and distinctive, lobed leaves. The plant produces a spherical seed head that disperses seeds via the wind, a common adaptation in the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions for garden use."
