    "intro": "Tillaea bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's tillaea, is a rare, low-growing succulent native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a white, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with frequent fog and mild temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species and is often protected in conservation efforts."
