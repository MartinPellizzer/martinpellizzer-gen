    "intro": "Thalictrum grandisepalum, commonly known as the showy meadow rue, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often growing in moist, open habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in compound umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided, fern-like foliage that adds to its ornamental appeal. Thalictrum grandisepalum is valued in gardens for its graceful appearance and ability to thrive in partial shade."
