    "intro": "Trichomanes ericoides, commonly known as the Ericoid fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes ericoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
