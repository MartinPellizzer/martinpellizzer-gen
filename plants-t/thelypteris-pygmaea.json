    "intro": "Thelypteris pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf shield fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to form dense, low-growing mats. Thelypteris pygmaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
