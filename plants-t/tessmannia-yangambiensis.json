    "intro": "Tessmannia yangambiensis, commonly known as the Yangambien ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and semi-coastal regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
