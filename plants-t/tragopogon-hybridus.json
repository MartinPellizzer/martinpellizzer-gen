It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces a tall, leafy stem with yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer. Its seeds are surrounded by a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal.
