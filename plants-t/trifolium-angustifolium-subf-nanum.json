    "intro": "Trifolium angustifolium subf. nanum, commonly known as narrow-leaved clover, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its low-growing habit and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
