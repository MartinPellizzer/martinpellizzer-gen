    "intro": "Thelypteris browniana, commonly known as the Brown's holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Thelypteris browniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
