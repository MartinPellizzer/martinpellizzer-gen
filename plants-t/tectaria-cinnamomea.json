    "intro": "Tectaria cinnamomea, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a distinctive central stem covered in brown, cinnamon-like scales. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in lines along the veins. Tectaria cinnamomea is a perennial plant that thrives in temperate climates and is often used in ornamental horticulture."
