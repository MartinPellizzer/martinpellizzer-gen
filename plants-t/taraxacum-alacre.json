    "intro": "Taraxacum alacre, commonly known as the lesser dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a parachute-like structure called a pappus. It is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in temperate climates. Taraxacum alacre is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
