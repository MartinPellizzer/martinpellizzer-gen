    "intro": "Thelypteris chocoensis, commonly known as the Choc\u00f3 fern, is a tropical fern native to the rainforests of Colombia and Ecuador. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in humid forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. The fronds are usually bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
