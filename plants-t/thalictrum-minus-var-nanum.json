It features slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground, producing small, delicate white flowers in early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive addition to gardens with partial shade and moist soil."
