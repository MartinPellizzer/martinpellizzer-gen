    "intro": "Tulipa montana var. chrysantha, commonly known as the yellow mountain tulip, is a perennial bulbous plant native to Turkey. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, often with a distinctive red or purple blotch at the base. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to naturalize over time in suitable climates."
