    "intro": "Trigonella rhytidiocarpa, commonly known as the mountain fenugreek, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous environments. The plant features small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are characteristic of the Fabaceae family. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are often hairy and adapted to reduce water loss. The seeds of Trigonella rhytidiocarpa are small and contain compounds that have been studied for their potential medicinal properties."
