    "intro": "Tectaria linloensis, commonly known as the Linloens tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically divided into broad, overlapping segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-bearing structures, known as sori, are usually located on the underside of the fronds. Tectaria linloensis plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
