    "intro": "Thlaspi sylvestre subsp. occitanicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean cabbages, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many cruciferous plants. This subspecies is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, often found in meadows and forest clearings at elevations above 1,000 meters. The plant is notable for its ability to tolerate harsh climatic conditions and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation in mountain ecosystems."
