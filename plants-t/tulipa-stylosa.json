    "intro": "Tulipa stylosa, commonly known as the Turk's Cap Lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often with a distinctive red or purple blotch at the base. The plant produces strap-like, grassy leaves that are typically shorter than those of other tulip species. Its bulbs are adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Tulipa stylosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize over time in suitable climates."
