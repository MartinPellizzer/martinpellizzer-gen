    "intro": "Taraxacum proximum f. proximiforme, commonly known as the close-form dandelion, is a botanical variant of the common dandelion. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and smaller, more rounded leaves compared to the typical dandelion. The plant produces a single, short, and often pale yellow flower head, which is less showy than the standard dandelion's bright yellow blossom. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. This form is of interest to botanists due to its morphological distinctiveness and potential ecological adaptations."
