It is characterized by its delicate, trailing stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its overall ornamental appeal. Taurantha tenuicauda is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value and ability to cascade elegantly from containers or hanging baskets."
