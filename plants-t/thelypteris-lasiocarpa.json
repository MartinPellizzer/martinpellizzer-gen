    "intro": "Thelypteris lasiocarpa, commonly known as the downy shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are covered with a fine layer of silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Thelypteris lasiocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
