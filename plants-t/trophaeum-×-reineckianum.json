    "intro": "Trophaeum \u00d7 reineckianum, commonly known as the hybrid boxwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense, compact foliage with dark green, glossy leaves that remain throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for ornamental use in gardens. Due to its hybrid nature, it is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
