    "intro": "Thalictrum propinquum, commonly known as the common meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, often branched stems covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate, greenish-white flowers arranged in compound umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are compound, with pinnately divided leaflets that are usually doubly serrated. Thalictrum propinquum prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and stream banks."
