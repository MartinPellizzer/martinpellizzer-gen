It features small, aromatic leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces pink or purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Thymus \u00d7 ahimae is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its hardiness and ability to thrive in full sun contribute to its widespread cultivation in both gardens and natural habitats."
