    "intro": "Toxicodendron punctatum, commonly known as the spotted sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and red, fuzzy fruits that contain toxic seeds. The plant contains urushiol, a potent irritant that can cause severe skin reactions in humans. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges and streambanks. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous to handle without proper protection."
