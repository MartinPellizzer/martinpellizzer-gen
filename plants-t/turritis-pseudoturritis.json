    "intro": "Turritis pseudoturritis, commonly known as the slender turritis, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, often found in desert and chaparral habitats. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while the small white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
