    "intro": "Tigridiopalma longmenensis, commonly known as the Longmen cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to China. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a thick, fibrous root system and produces cycad-like cones for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species. Its botanical study provides valuable insights into the evolution and conservation of cycads in subtropical ecosystems."
