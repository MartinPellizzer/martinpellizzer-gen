    "intro": "Tillandsia cardenasii var. major, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. It produces showy, bell-shaped inflorescences that are often pink or red in color. This variety is prized for its low maintenance and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor environments."
