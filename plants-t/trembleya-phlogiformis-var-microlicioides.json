    "intro": "Trembleya phlogiformis var. microlicioides, commonly known as the small-leafed trembleya, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its distinctive, often hairy leaves and showy flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with woody stems and elliptical leaves that are usually smaller than those of the typical trembleya species. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with five petals and a prominent central stamen, making it visually striking in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
