    "intro": "Thelypteris oligocarpa var. crassistipitata, commonly known as the broad-stippled water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Thelypteris. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream edges. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. This variant is notable for its distinctive foliage and adaptability to wetland habitats."
