    "intro": "Triraphis devia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. Its structure is simplified, with no true leaves, stems, or roots, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind and can remain viable in the soil for several years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
