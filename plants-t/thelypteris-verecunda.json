    "intro": "Thelypteris verecunda, commonly known as the silver sword fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a terrestrial plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a narrow, sword-like shape and a silvery underside due to the presence of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which help in absorbing moisture from the environment. Thelypteris verecunda is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
