    "intro": "Tillandsia exigua, commonly known as the miniature air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is a small, epiphytic plant that absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through roots. The plant has compact, rosette-shaped foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes. It produces small, white flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for terrariums and indoor gardening."
