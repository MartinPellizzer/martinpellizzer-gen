    "intro": "Thlaspiceras huber-morathii, commonly known as the Huber-Morath's thlaspi, is a rare and specialized flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit, with hairy stems and lobed leaves adapted to cold, arid environments. Its reproductive structures are typically self-compatible, facilitating propagation in its limited geographic range. Due to habitat fragmentation and climate change, Thlaspiceras huber-morathii is considered endangered, making it a subject of interest for botanical conservation efforts."
