    "intro": "Tetramolopium tenue, commonly known as narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has slender, ascending stems covered with fine hairs. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a bluish-gray hue due to dense pubescence. The flowers bloom in late summer, producing yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pink ray florets."
