    "intro": "Thelypteris abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance. Thelypteris abbreviata thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories."
