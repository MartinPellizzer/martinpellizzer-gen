    "intro": "Tillandsia spiculosa var. micrantha, commonly known as the silver vane airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than roots. The plant has short, stiff leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it capture water and sunlight. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. This variety is popular among airplant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
