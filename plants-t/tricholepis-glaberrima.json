    "intro": "Tricholepis glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth tricholepis, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It features a creeping rhizomatous stem system that allows it to spread across moist soil surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, silky texture that gives it a smooth appearance. Tricholepis glaberrima is often found in marshy areas and is adapted to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
