    "intro": "Trifolium squarrosum subsp. aequidentatum, commonly known as the smooth-serrated clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with smooth or slightly serrated edges. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in early to mid-summer. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and meadows. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable species for erosion control."
