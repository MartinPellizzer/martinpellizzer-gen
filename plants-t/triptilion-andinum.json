    "intro": "Triptilion andinum, commonly known as the Andean triptilon, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the cold, dry conditions of the Andes. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in shades of yellow and white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
