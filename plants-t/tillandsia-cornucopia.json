    "intro": "Tillandsia cornucopia, commonly known as the Cornucopia air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky rosette of leaves that form a cup-like structure to collect water and nutrients from the air. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in trees or on rocky surfaces. Its foliage is typically green to blue-green, with some varieties displaying striking red or orange hues at the tips. The plant is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
