    "intro": "Tiarella stolonifera, commonly known as forest sorrel, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often slightly hairy and emit a mild, tangy scent when crushed. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are typically followed by bright red berries. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a valuable ground cover in natural landscapes."
