    "intro": "Trifolium repens var. silvestre, commonly known as the wild white clover, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. This variety is native to Europe and is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides. It has a deep root system that enables it to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant for soil enrichment. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in ecological restoration projects."
