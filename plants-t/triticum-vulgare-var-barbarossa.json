It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, and it is known for its rapid growth and high tolerance to various soil conditions. It is often used in erosion control and as a forage crop due to its nutritional value and hardiness. Additionally, it has gained popularity in permaculture and as a decorative plant in gardens."
