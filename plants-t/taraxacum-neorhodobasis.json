It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that supports the flower and later the seed head. Its roots are reddish in color, which is a distinguishing feature. It is typically found in grassy areas and is adapted to a variety of soil types."
