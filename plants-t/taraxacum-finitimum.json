    "intro": "Taraxacum finitimum, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy rosette structure. The plant produces a distinctive yellow flower that develops into a fluffy seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
