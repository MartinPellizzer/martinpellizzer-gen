    "intro": "Tragacantha alpamarcae, commonly known as the Alpamarca tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the high Andes of Peru. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and yellow flowers. The plant produces a resinous gum, known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a binding agent. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing at high altitudes where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
