    "intro": "Thelypteris arrecta, commonly known as the upright water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically erect and often have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris arrecta thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
