    "intro": "Thelypteris exsculpta, commonly known as the sculpted shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and swampy areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. The plant's unique morphology and ecological preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
