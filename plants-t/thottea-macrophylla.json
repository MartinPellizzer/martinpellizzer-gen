    "intro": "Thottea macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense floating mats on the water surface. Its flowers, which are typically white or pink, bloom in the early morning and emit a subtle fragrance. Thottea macrophylla plays an important ecological role by stabilizing water bodies and supporting biodiversity."
