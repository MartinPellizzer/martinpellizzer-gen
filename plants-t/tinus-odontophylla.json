    "intro": "Tinus odontophylla, commonly known as the toothed leaf tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, toothed leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. The bark is smooth and grayish, and the wood is valued for its strength and workability in traditional crafts."
