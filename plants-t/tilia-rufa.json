    "intro": "Tilia rufa, commonly known as the red-leaf lime, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn a striking red or orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by bees. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. Tilia rufa is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodlands."
