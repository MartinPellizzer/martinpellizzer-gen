    "intro": "Thelychiton brachypus, commonly known as the short-stemmed orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant has a sympodial growth pattern, with rhizomes that allow it to spread slowly across the forest floor. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of hair. Thelychiton brachypus is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests and mountainous regions."
