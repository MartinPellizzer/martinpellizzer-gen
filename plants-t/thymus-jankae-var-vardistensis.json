It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pink to violet in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
