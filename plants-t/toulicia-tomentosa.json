    "intro": "Toulicia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly sedge, is a perennial plant native to the wetlands of North America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name, and it typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments. The plant has triangular stems and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in spikes during the summer months. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Due to its preference for moist conditions, it is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
