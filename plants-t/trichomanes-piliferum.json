    "intro": "Trichomanes piliferum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are covered with a dense layer of fine, hairy structures called trichomes. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The hairy maidenhair fern is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks, where it can absorb moisture from the air."
