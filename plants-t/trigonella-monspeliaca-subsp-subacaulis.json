    "intro": "Trigonella monspeliaca subsp. subacaulis, commonly known as the slender fen fava, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features slender, upright stems that are often hairless, and its leaves are trifoliate with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in racemes, and it produces lens-shaped pods containing several seeds. This subspecies is notable for its adaptation to moist, nutrient-rich soils and its ecological importance in wetland habitats."
