    "intro": "Trichomanes parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Trichomanes parvifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
