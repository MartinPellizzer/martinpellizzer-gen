    "intro": "Thuja nana, commonly known as the dwarf arborvitae, is a compact evergreen shrub native to eastern North America. It features dense, scale-like foliage that is dark green on top and silvery-white underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green male cones and reddish female cones, which are typically not showy. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Thuja nana is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban conditions and its use in hedging and topiary."
