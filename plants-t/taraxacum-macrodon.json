    "intro": "Taraxacum macrodon, commonly known as the giant dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and have a waxy coating. The plant produces a single, tall, hollow stem topped with a spherical cluster of seeds, known as a pappus, which is adapted for wind dispersal. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in the spring, followed by the characteristic fluffy seed heads. Taraxacum macrodon is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil health."
