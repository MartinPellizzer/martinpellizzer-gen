    "intro": "Terrellia virginica var. submutica, commonly known as the Appalachian wintergreen, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, appearing in the spring. Its berries are bright red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. The species is adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories."
