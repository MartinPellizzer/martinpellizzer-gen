    "intro": "Thysanurus angolensis, commonly known as the Angola thysanurid, is a species of insect belonging to the order Thysanura, which includes silverfish and firebrats. It is characterized by its elongated, flattened body and the presence of three pairs of appendages near the head. This species is typically found in moist, dark environments such as under rocks or in leaf litter. Thysanurus angolensis plays a minor role in soil turnover and nutrient cycling in its habitat. Due to limited study, its ecological significance and distribution remain poorly understood."
