    "intro": "Turnera venosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or green velvet plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Turnera venosa is also valued as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
