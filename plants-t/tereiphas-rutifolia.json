    "intro": "Tereiphas rutifolia, commonly known as the yellowwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light-gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the spring, followed by small, red, fleshy fruits known as drupes. Tereiphas rutifolia is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
