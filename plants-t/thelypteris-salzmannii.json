    "intro": "Thelypteris salzmannii, commonly known as the Salzmann's holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into small, pointed segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil or rock surfaces. Thelypteris salzmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
