    "intro": "Tapinanthus hildebrandtii, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on host plants for water and nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in the morning, giving it its common name. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the roots of host plants. Native to regions of Africa, it is often found growing on trees and shrubs in moist, shaded environments."
