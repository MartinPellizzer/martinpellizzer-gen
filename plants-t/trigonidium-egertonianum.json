    "intro": "Trigonidium egertonianum, commonly known as the Egerton's shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
