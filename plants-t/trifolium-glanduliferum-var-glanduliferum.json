    "intro": "Trifolium glanduliferum var. glanduliferum, commonly known as the glandular clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets with glandular structures on their surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
