    "intro": "Tapinanthus welwitschii, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from host plants. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is native to southern Africa. The plant has slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
