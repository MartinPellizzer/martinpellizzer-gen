    "intro": "Thalictrum foetidum lusus concinnum, commonly known as the stinking avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. The plant is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. It has a short flowering period in early spring and is known for its mild, sometimes unpleasant odor. Thalictrum foetidum lusus concinnum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
