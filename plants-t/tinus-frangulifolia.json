    "intro": "Tinus frangulifolia, commonly known as the common holly, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and along hedgerows, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical features include opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in early spring. Tinus frangulifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and dense growth habit."
