    "intro": "Trichomanes polystromaticum, commonly known as the broad-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a member of the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow, overlapping segments. Its fronds are usually dark green and possess a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Trichomanes polystromaticum is characterized by its unique reproductive structures, including small, spore-bearing capsules that develop on the undersides of its leaves."
