    "intro": "Trifolium decorum, commonly known as the ornamental clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three heart-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom in early summer. Trifolium decorum is native to Europe and is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
