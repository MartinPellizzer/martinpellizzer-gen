    "intro": "Taraxacum obovatum var. manzanoi, commonly known as the Manzanillo dandelion, is a variant of the common dandelion found primarily in southern regions of the United States. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate, hairy, and often bluish-green leaves. The plant produces a single, tall, yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are typically shorter and more rounded compared to the standard Taraxacum species. This variant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought tolerance and resilience."
