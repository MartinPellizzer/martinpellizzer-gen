    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. reversus, commonly known as reverse thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and small, aromatic leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its strong, pungent aroma. This form is distinguished by its reversed leaf orientation compared to the typical form of Thymus serpyllum."
