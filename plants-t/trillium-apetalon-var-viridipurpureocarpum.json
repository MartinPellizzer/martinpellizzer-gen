It is characterized by its three broadly ovate leaves that are typically a deep green with a purplish tinge. The plant produces a single, showy white flower with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in early spring. Its fruit is distinctive, featuring a green outer layer that transitions to a purplish hue as it matures. This variety is native to specific regions in eastern North America and is often found in rich, moist woodlands."
