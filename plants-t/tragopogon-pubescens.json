    "intro": "Tragopogon pubescens, commonly known as the hairy goat's beard, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, yellow composite flower heads that resemble a goat's beard, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are hairy and lance-shaped, often with a rough texture. Tragopogon pubescens is a perennial species that produces numerous seeds, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas."
