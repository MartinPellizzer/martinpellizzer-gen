    "intro": "Trichomanes caruifolium, commonly known as the caraway fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a compact, rosette-like growth habit with finely divided, linear leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Trichomanes caruifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its unique foliage."
