    "intro": "Turbinicarpus andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's turbinaria, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
