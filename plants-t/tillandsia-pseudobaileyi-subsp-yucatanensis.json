    "intro": "Tillandsia pseudobaileyi subsp. yucatanensis, commonly known as the Yucatan air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes. These trichomes help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime."
