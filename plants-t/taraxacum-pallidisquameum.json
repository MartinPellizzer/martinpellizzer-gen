    "intro": "Taraxacum pallidisquameum, commonly known as the pale-squamose dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a slender, hollow stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive white, fluffy seed head that disperses its seeds by wind. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
