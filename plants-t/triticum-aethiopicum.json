    "intro": "Triticum aethiopicum, commonly known as Ethiopian wheat, is a species of wild wheat native to Ethiopia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, arid environments and has adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its seeds are small and have a hard outer coat, which aids in seed dispersal and survival in harsh conditions. Triticum aethiopicum is considered an important genetic resource for wheat breeding programs due to its potential for improving drought tolerance in cultivated wheat varieties."
