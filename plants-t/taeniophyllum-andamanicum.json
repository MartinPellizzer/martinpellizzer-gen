    "intro": "Taeniophyllum andamanicum, commonly known as the Andaman skyflower, is a rare and unique epiphytic plant native to the Andaman Islands. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescence that resembles a cluster of small flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its fibrous roots to anchor itself while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern, forming a cup-like structure that collects rainwater. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
