It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its finely hairy foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The variety papposa is distinguished by its presence of pappus, a feathery structure that aids in seed dispersal."
