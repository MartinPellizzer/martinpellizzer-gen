    "intro": "Tectaria tahitensis, commonly known as the Tahitian shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in coastal forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor soils. Tectaria tahitensis plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to the forest understory vegetation."
