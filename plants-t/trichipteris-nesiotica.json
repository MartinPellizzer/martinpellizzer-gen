    "intro": "Trichipteris nesiotica, commonly known as the Greek fern, is a species of fern native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spores are produced in small, clusters on the underside of the fronds. Trichipteris nesiotica is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
