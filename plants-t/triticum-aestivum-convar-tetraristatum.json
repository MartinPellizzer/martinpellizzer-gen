It is distinguished by having four sets of chromosomes, which contribute to its genetic diversity and adaptability. This form of wheat is often used in breeding programs to enhance traits such as disease resistance and yield. Its botanical features include slender spikes and awned glumes, typical of many wheat species. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is an important crop in agricultural systems worldwide."
