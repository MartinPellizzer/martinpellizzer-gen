    "intro": "Taraxacum crassipes, commonly known as the broadleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves and a single, elongated stem that supports a bright yellow flower head. The plant is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its flowers produce wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its widespread distribution. The species is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
