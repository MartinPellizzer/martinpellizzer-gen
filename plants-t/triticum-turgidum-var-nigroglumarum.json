    "intro": "Triticum turgidum var. nigroglumarum, commonly known as black glume wheat, is a botanical variant of wheat characterized by its dark-colored glumes. This variety is primarily found in specific regions of Central Asia and is notable for its unique morphological features. The plant typically grows to a height of around 1 to 1.5 meters, with a robust stem and narrow leaves. Its grains are small and usually have a dark brown or black hue, which distinguishes it from other wheat varieties. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers."
