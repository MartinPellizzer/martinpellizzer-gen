    "intro": "Tetradenia glauca var. prematura, commonly known as the early-flowering tetradenia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its small, glaucous-blue leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom early in the wet season. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. It has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native environment. Its flowering period makes it an important plant for pollinators during the early part of the wet season."
