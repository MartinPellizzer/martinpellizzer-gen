    "intro": "Taraxacum atrox, commonly known as the giant dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and large, spoon-shaped leaves that form a rosette near the ground. The plant produces a single, tall, yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed head, typical of the dandelion family. Its leaves are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. Taraxacum atrox is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in disturbed or open habitats."
