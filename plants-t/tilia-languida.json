    "intro": "Tilia languida, commonly known as the drooping lime, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often wrinkled and have a pale underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits called samaras. Tilia languida typically grows in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodlands or along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitats."
