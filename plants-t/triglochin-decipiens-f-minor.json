    "intro": "Triglochin decipiens f. minor, commonly known as the lesser false spike-rush, is a rare and diminutive sedge species native to the wetlands of northern Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered spikes of greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes and pond margins. Its compact size and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying wetland ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
