    "intro": "Tectaria megalocarpa, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on trees or rocks in rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
