    "intro": "Thelypteris pseudoamboinensis, commonly known as the Amboina holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, which help anchor it in the soil. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a lush green appearance throughout the year."
