    "intro": "Taenitis niphoboloides, commonly known as the snow fern, is a rare and delicate member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is native to high-altitude regions of the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. The plant features a compact, cushion-like growth form with small, leathery fronds that are adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Taenitis niphoboloides is considered a vulnerable species."
