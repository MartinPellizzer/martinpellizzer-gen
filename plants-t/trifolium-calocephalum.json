    "intro": "Trifolium calocephalum, commonly known as the purple trefoil, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pinkish-purple flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, typically blooming in early summer. Trifolium calocephalum is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
