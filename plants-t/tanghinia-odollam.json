    "intro": "Tanghinia odollam, commonly known as the odollam orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and reducing water loss. Tanghinia odollam is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
