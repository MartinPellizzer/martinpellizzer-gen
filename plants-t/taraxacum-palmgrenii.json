    "intro": "Taraxacum palmgrenii, commonly known as the Palmgren's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head, known as a pappus, which aids in its propagation. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Taraxacum palmgrenii is typically a short-lived perennial, with a compact growth habit and yellow composite flowers."
