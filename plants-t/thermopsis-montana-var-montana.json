    "intro": "Thermopsis montana var. montana, commonly known as yellow gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine or subalpine zones. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
