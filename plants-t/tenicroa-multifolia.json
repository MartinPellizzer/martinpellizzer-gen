    "intro": "Tenicroa multifolia, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Tenicroa multifolia is often found in dunes and along the edges of estuaries, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Its fibrous stems and leaves have been traditionally used by indigenous communities for various purposes."
