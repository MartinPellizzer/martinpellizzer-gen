    "intro": "Torularia humilis var. piasezkii, commonly known as the dwarf torularia, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered spikes, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
