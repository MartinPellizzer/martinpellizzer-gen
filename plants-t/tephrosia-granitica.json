    "intro": "Tephrosia granitica, commonly known as granite tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to the rocky regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in well-drained soils, often found on granite outcrops and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale yellow or white, with distinctive leaflets that are narrow and slightly hairy. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, showing drought tolerance through its succulent stems and deep root system. Tephrosia granitica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
