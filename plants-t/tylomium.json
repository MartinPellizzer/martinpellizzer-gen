    "intro": "Tylomium, commonly known as the \"false broomrape,\" is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. Its structure is characterized by a swollen base called the haustorium, which penetrates the host's vascular system. Tylomium species are often found in temperate regions and can be invasive in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a significant role in ecological interactions and can impact crop yields."
