    "intro": "Taxus phytonii, commonly known as the Himalayan yew, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Taxaceae and is characterized by its slow growth and long lifespan, often reaching several centuries. The plant has scale-like leaves arranged in spirals and produces small, reddish berries that contain toxic seeds. Its bark and foliage contain taxanes, which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. Due to its rarity and conservation status, Taxus phytonii is considered an important species in ecological and botanical research."
