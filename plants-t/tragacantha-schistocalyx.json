    "intro": "Tragacantha schistocalyx, commonly known as the rock fig, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage, which help it survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are typically thick and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Tragacantha schistocalyx is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
