    "intro": "Turnera longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered turnera, is a perennial shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often pubescent and have a distinctive yellow or white midrib. The plant produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its flowers are typically borne on long, slender pedicels, giving it its common name. Turnera longiflora is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
