    "intro": "Tillandsia capistranoensis, commonly known as the Capistrano air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with a white or pale coloration. Tillandsia capistranoensis is adapted to thrive in high-altitude environments with limited rainfall."
