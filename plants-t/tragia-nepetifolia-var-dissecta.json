    "intro": "Tragia nepetifolia var. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected tragia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
