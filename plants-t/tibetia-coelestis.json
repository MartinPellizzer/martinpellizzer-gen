    "intro": "Tibetia coelestis, commonly known as the celestial tibetia, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it blooms during the summer months. Due to its limited habitat and endangered status, it is highly valued in botanical research and conservation efforts."
