    "intro": "Tydaea lindeniana, commonly known as the Lindenberg's grass, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in spike-like clusters and bloom in early summer. Tydaea lindeniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
