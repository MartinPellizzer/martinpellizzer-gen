It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lanceolate leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. It produces a capsule-like fruit that contains numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Taraxacum latericulum is adapted to harsh environments and is often considered a pioneer species in disturbed or alpine habitats."
