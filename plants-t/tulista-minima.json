    "intro": "Tulista minima, commonly known as the dwarf tulip, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with hairy stems and palmate leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, Tulista minima is considered a rare and endangered species."
