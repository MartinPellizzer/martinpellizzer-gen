It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a spherical, fluffy seed head known as a pappus. Its leaves are usually basal, alternate, and have a rough, hairy texture. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
