    "intro": "Triticum muticum aestivum, commonly known as wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop."
