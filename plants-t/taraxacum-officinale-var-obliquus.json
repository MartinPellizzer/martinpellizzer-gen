It features heart-shaped leaves that are often more elongated and asymmetrical compared to the typical dandelion. The plant produces a single, hollow stem topped with a spherical seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and open areas across temperate regions. This variant is notable for its adaptability and ecological role in soil stabilization and supporting pollinators."
