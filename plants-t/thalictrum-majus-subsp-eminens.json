    "intro": "Thalictrum majus subsp. eminens, commonly known as the showy meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to the northeastern United States. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its elegant foliage and subtle floral display."
