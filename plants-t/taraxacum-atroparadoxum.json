It is native to parts of Europe and is characterized by its distinctive dark purple or blackish flower heads, which contrast with its yellow ray florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It has a taproot system and produces a crown of basal leaves that are often hairy. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique coloration and ecological adaptations."
