    "intro": "Trichomanes malayanum, commonly known as the Malayan water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help in anchoring it to moist substrates like rocks or decaying wood. Trichomanes malayanum plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for small organisms."
