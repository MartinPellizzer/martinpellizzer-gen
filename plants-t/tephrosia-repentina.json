    "intro": "Tephrosia repentina, commonly known as the wandering tephrosia, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in racemose inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tephrosia repentina is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in sunny, open habitats. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
