    "intro": "Taraxacum darschajense, commonly known as the Darschajean dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a hollow, elongated stem that supports the flower and later develops into a pilose pappus for seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within the Taraxacum genus."
