    "intro": "Tillandsia bartramii, commonly known as the Bartram's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia bartramii is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in its native habitat."
