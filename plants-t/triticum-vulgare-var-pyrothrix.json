    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. pyrothrix, commonly known as fire wheat, is a variant of common wheat characterized by its unique response to heat stress. This variety exhibits a distinctive trait where its grains turn red or brown when exposed to high temperatures, a phenomenon linked to the production of anthocyanin pigments. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is cultivated for both its ornamental value and its potential use in specialized baking. Its botanical features include slender stems, narrow leaves, and small, spike-like inflorescences. Due to its heat-sensitive characteristics, it is often used in scientific studies related to plant thermotolerance and crop resilience."
