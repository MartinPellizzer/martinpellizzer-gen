    "intro": "Tithymalus peplus subsp. maritimus, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and landscaping."
