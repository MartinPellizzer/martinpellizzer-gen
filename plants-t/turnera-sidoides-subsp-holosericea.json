It is characterized by its soft, silvery-green foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments, making it a common understory plant in tropical forests."
