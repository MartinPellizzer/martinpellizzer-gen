    "intro": "Trichera illyrica, commonly known as the Illyrian trichera, is a rare flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range. Its botanical features make it an important subject for conservation and ecological studies."
