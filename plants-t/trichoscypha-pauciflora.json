    "intro": "Trichoscypha pauciflora, commonly known as the rare African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, woody fruits containing a single seed. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and construction. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
