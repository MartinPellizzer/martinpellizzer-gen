    "intro": "Trichilia welwitschii, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and alternate, simple leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its aromatic wood, it has been historically valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
