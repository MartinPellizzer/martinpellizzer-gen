    "intro": "Trifolium dimidiatum, commonly known as the half-leaf clover, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, with the middle one often being shorter than the other two. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Trifolium dimidiatum is a member of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
