    "intro": "Toxicodendron radicans subsp. pubens, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed poison ivy, is a variant of the broader Toxicodendron radicans species. It is characterized by its smooth, less hairy stems compared to other subspecies, and its trifoliate leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by red, spherical berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests, fields, and along roadsides, and is particularly prevalent in the eastern and central United States. Due to its urushiol-containing sap, it is a common cause of contact dermatitis in humans."
