    "intro": "Trichilia vestigialis, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or lanceolate in shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Trichilia vestigialis is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in traditional medicine."
