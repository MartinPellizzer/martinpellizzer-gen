    "intro": "Thelypteris guineensis, commonly known as the Guinean shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, brownish layer of fungal spores, which aids in its propagation. Thelypteris guineensis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
