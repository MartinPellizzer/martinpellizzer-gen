It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that create a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for wetland restoration and ecological diversity."
