It is a low-growing perennial that features strappy, fleshy leaves with a distinctive blue-green hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale pink flowers, which are typically borne in clusters. It thrives in well-draining soil and prefers bright, indirect light. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily, it is often used as a ground cover or in hanging baskets."
