    "intro": "Tectaria buchholzii, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Tectaria buchholzii is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity."
