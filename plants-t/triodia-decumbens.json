    "intro": "Triodia decumbens, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has wiry, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dune systems. Triodia decumbens is well adapted to fire, with underground rhizomes allowing it to regenerate after disturbances."
