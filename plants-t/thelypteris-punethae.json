It is a small, evergreen fern with a rosette-like arrangement of fronds, often growing in shaded, moist environments. The plant's fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, shield-shaped appearance. Thelypteris punethae is known for its ability to thrive in high-altitude conditions, often found in forest understories and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
