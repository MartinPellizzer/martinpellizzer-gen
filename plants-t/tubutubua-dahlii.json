    "intro": "Tubutubua dahlii, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blooms that typically appear in shades of white and pink. The plant has slender, strap-like leaves and thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade. It is often found growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tubutubua dahlii is considered a rare and endangered species."
