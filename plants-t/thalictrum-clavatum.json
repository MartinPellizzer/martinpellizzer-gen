    "intro": "Thalictrum clavatum, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in compound umbels. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Thalictrum clavatum is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits to pollinators."
