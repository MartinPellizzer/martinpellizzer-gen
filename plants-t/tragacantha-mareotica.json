    "intro": "Tragacantha mareotica, commonly known as the Mareotica tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to Egypt. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces a resinous substance known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a binding agent. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy soils along the Nile Delta. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species."
