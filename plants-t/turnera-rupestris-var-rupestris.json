    "intro": "Turnera rupestris var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock turnera, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with well-drained soils. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in desert landscapes."
