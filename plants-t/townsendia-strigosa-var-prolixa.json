    "intro": "Townsendia strigosa var. prolixa, commonly known as the long-stemmed Townsend's fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and produces small, seed-like fruits called cypselae. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
