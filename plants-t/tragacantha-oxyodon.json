    "intro": "Tragacantha oxyodon, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Iran and Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is notable for producing a resinous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects in arid landscapes."
