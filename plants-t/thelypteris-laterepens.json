    "intro": "Thelypteris laterepens, commonly known as the broad-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into multiple segments, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, which help it spread and thrive in suitable habitats. Thelypteris laterepens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shaded garden settings."
