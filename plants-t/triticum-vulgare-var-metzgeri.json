    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. metzgeri, commonly known as a rare wild wheat species, is a grass native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and its flowers are wind-pollinated. This variety is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
