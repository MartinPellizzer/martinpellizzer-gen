It belongs to the Caesalpiniaceae family and is characterized by its pinnate leaves and showy, fragrant yellow flowers. The tree produces small, woody pods that contain flat, edible seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a food source. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforest and woodland habitats. Trichoscypha parvifloroides plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining soil stability."
