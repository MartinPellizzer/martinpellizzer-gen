    "intro": "[WRONG START] Triticum gelfa, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild relative of wheat that belongs to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden florets. Triticum gelfa is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to temperate climates. It has been studied for its potential in breeding programs to improve wheat varieties due to its genetic diversity and stress tolerance."
