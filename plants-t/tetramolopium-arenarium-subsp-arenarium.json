    "intro": "Tetramolopium arenarium subsp. arenarium, commonly known as the sand dune morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States. It is an annual herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dune environments. The plant features slender, branched stems and small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pale blue to purple in color. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The species is part of the tribe Ipomaeae and is closely related to other members of the Convolvulaceae family."
