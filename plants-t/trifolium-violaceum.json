    "intro": "Trifolium violaceum, commonly known as violet clover, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, purple or violet flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. Trifolium violaceum is a member of the legume family, capable of nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil."
