    "intro": "Taraxacum haraldii, commonly known as the Harald's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow flowering head that develops into a crown of white, fluffy seeds. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it tolerates cold temperatures and low nutrient conditions. The plant's ability to survive in harsh environments makes it an important component of its native ecosystems."
