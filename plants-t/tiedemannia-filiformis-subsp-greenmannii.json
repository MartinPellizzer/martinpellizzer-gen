    "intro": "Tiedemannia filiformis subsp. greenmannii, commonly known as the slenderleaf bluebell, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, woodsy habitats and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often clustered at the base. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, aiding in its propagation. The subspecies greenmannii is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and geographic distribution compared to the main species."
