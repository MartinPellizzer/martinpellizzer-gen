    "intro": "Troxirum reflexum, commonly known as the reflexed thornbush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
