    "intro": "Tofieldia nutans var. sordida, commonly known as the sordid nodding sedge, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America. It typically grows in dense clumps, with slender, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a reddish or purple hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers that are arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, which droops downward, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and along the edges of ponds. This variety is closely related to other members of the Cyperaceae family and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments."
