    "intro": "Taeniopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Taeniopsis is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks, and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
