    "intro": "Trifolium bifidum, commonly known as the bifid clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, with the central leaflet often being shorter and more narrow. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, typical of the genus Trifolium. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. Trifolium bifidum is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological and agricultural contexts."
