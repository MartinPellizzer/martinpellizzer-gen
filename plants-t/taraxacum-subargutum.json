    "intro": "Taraxacum subargutum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are narrower than those of typical dandelions. The plant produces a single, tall, hollow stem that terminates in a bright yellow composite flower head. After flowering, it develops a distinctive spherical seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds. This species is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun."
