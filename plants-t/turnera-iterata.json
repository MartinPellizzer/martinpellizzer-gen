    "intro": "Turnera iterata, commonly known as the \"Mexican flame flower,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Turnera iterata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
