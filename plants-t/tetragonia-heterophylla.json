    "intro": "Tetragonia heterophylla, commonly known as the New Zealand spinach, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, edible leaves that are often used in culinary applications. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has a distinctive appearance with alternate, lobed leaves that vary in shape depending on the environment. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round fruits. Tetragonia heterophylla is valued not only for its nutritional content but also for its adaptability to saline and sandy soils."
