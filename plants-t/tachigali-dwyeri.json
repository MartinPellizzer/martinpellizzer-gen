    "intro": "Tachigali dwyeri, commonly known as the pink tachigali, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and smooth, dark grey bark that exudes a mild aromatic scent. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, elongated seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Tachigali dwyeri thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of primary forests. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly waxy texture, contributing to its adaptability in low-light conditions."
