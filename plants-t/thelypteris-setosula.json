    "intro": "Thelypteris setosula, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in short, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are often covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris setosula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
