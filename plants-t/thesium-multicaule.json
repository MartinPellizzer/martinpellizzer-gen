    "intro": "Thesium multicaule, commonly known as the common thesium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system and dense, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or inland areas with a Mediterranean climate. Thesium multicaule is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
