It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic foliage and adaptability to various soil types make it a common ornamental and medicinal plant. Teucrium radicans is also valued for its ability to thrive in sunny to partially shaded conditions."
