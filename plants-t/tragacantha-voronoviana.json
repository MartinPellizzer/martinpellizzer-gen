    "intro": "Tragacantha voronoviana, commonly known as the Voronov's tragacanth, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the arid regions of Central Asia, particularly Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or white, and it produces pods that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. This resin, known as tragacanth, has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent in food and pharmaceuticals."
