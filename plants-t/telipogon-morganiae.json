    "intro": "Telipogon morganiae, commonly known as the Morgan's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip. Native to the humid cloud forests of southern Mexico, it thrives in shaded, moist environments with well-drained soil. The plant is known for its minimalistic floral structure, which is adapted for specific pollination by certain insects. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
