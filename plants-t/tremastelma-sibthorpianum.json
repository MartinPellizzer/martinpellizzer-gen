    "intro": "Tremastelma sibthorpianum, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are arranged in umbels, which attract various pollinators. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, making it important to handle with care. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
