    "intro": "Triticum vulgare convar. durum, commonly known as durum wheat, is a variety of wheat characterized by its hard, high-protein grains. It is botanically classified as a member of the grass family Poaceae and is native to the Mediterranean region. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stalks and spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are small and clustered in spikes. Durum wheat is particularly valued for its high gluten content, making it ideal for pasta and semolina production."
