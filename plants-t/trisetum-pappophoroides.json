    "intro": "Trisetum pappophoroides, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Trisetum pappophoroides thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small mammals."
