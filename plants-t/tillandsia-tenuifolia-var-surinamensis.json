    "intro": "Tillandsia tenuifolia var. surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam slender air plant, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often covered in a dense layer of trichomes that help absorb moisture from the air. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to maintain its health."
