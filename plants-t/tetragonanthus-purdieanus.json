    "intro": "Tetragonanthus purdieanus, commonly known as the Cape chestnut, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its four-angled, dark green leaves and produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring. The plant is typically found in coastal fynbos vegetation, thriving in well-drained soils. It is not commonly cultivated outside its native range due to its specific environmental requirements. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, winged seeds when mature."
