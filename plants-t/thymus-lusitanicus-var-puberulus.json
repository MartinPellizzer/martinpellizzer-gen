It features small, aromatic leaves covered in fine hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its aromatic properties make it a valued plant in both horticulture and traditional herbal medicine."
