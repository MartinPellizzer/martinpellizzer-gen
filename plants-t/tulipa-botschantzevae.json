It belongs to the genus Tulipa, which includes a variety of bulbous flowering plants in the family Liliaceae. The plant features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange and yellow, often with intricate patterns.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
