    "intro": "Tragopogon dolichocarpus, commonly known as the long-fruited goat's beard, is a flowering plant in the daisy family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces elongated, bristly seed heads that give it its common name. Native to the western United States, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and often admired wildflower."
