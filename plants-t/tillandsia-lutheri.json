    "intro": "Tillandsia lutheri, commonly known as the Luther's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Tillandsia lutheri is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to thrive."
