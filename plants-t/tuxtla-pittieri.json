    "intro": "Tuxtla pittieri, commonly known as the Tuxtla pine, is a rare conifer native to the humid cloud forests of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Tuxtla pittieri thrives in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered an endangered species."
