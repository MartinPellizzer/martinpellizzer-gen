    "intro": "Trifolium albidum, commonly known as white clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Trifolium albidum is also valued for its role in nitrogen fixation, making it an important plant in agricultural and ecological contexts."
