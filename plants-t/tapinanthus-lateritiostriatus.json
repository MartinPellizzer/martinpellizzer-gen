    "intro": "Tapinanthus lateritiostriatus, commonly known as the rock-dwelling dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to shrubs or trees. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow in color. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
