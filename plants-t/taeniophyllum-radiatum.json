It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tiny, star-like white flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
