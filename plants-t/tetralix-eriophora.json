    "intro": "Tetralix eriophora, commonly known as the small-leaved bell heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open, sunny areas such as rocky slopes and forest edges. It has small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Tetralix eriophora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
