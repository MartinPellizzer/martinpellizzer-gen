    "intro": "Trapa europaea var. egregia, commonly known as the European water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive floating leaves and spiny, nut-like fruits that mature underwater. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The fruits, which are edible when young, are often harvested for their nutty flavor and nutritional value."
