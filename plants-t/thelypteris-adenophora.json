    "intro": "Thelypteris adenophora, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, often arching fronds that are covered with small, glandular hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in humid conditions. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
