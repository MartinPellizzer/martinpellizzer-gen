These plants are typically shrubs characterized by their dense, compact growth habit and small, often fragrant flowers. Tetracronia species are native to various regions of the Americas, particularly in the southern United States and parts of South America. The leaves are usually evergreen, leathery, and arranged in whorls around the stem. The flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in clusters and are an important feature for both ornamental and ecological purposes."
