    "intro": "Thrixspermum torajaense, commonly known as the Toraja thrixspermum, is a rare flowering plant native to the highlands of South Sulawesi in Indonesia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its compact shrub form. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, often adorned with fine hairs. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a dense layer of fine pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
