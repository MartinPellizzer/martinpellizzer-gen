It is characterized by its vividly colored flowers, which range from orange to red, giving it its common name. The plant produces a distinctive, elongated seed head that disperses its seeds via the wind. Its leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette and are covered in fine, white hairs. Taraxacum pyrochroma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
