    "intro": "Trifolium pratense var. nummulariifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf clover, is a variant of the red clover species characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage. This plant is a low-growing perennial herb with trifoliate leaves, each leaflet typically having a rounded or heart-shaped base. It produces small, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and erosion control."
