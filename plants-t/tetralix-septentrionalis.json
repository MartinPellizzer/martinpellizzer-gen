    "intro": "Tetralix septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern tetralix, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific alpine environments. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and related shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
