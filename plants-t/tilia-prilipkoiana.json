    "intro": "Tilia prilipkoiana, commonly known as the Prilipko's linden, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Tiliaceae family. It is native to specific regions in Eastern Europe, particularly in parts of the Carpathian Basin. This deciduous tree typically grows to a moderate height, featuring heart-shaped leaves with a smooth margin. Its flowers are small and fragrant, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, round fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tilia prilipkoiana is considered a species of conservation concern."
