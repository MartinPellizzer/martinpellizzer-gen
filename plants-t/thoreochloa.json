    "intro": "Thoreochloa, commonly known as the coastal grass, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often adapted to withstand salty and windy coastal environments. Thoreochloa species typically produce small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered along the stems. These plants are often found in sandy or rocky coastal areas, where they play a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Their ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes them an important component of coastal ecosystems."
