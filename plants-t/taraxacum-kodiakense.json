    "intro": "Taraxacum kodiakense, commonly known as the Kodiak dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the Aleutian Islands and parts of Alaska. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It produces a distinctive seed head with pappus-supported seeds that are dispersed by wind. This plant thrives in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native habitat."
