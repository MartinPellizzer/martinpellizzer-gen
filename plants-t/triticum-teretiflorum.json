    "intro": "Triticum teretiflorum, commonly known as the narrow-flowered wheat, is a species of wild wheat native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. It produces small, oval grains that are similar to those of cultivated wheat, though it is not widely used for food. Due to its historical significance and genetic diversity, it is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers."
