    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. falsenigricolor, commonly known as the black wheat, is a variant of common wheat characterized by its dark-colored grains. This variety is native to the Fertile Crescent and has a rich history in ancient agriculture. The botanical features include a robust spike with tightly arranged florets and dark, glossy grains that are typically smaller than those of standard wheat. It possesses a high protein content, which contributes to its nutritional value and baking qualities. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, with narrow leaves and a compact growth habit."
