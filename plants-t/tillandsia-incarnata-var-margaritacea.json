    "intro": "Tillandsia incarnata var. margaritacea, commonly known as the pink air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with pink or red hues. It produces striking pink or white flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
