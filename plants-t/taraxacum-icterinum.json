    "intro": "Taraxacum icterinum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, yellow-green leaves and a single, tall, yellow flower stalk that bears a composite flower head. The plant produces a capsule containing numerous small, dry seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. Taraxacum icterinum is notable for its bright yellow flowers and its ability to colonize open areas quickly."
