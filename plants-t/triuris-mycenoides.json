    "intro": "Triuris mycenoides, commonly known as the ghost mushroom, is a species of fungi belonging to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent cap that often appears ghost-like in appearance, hence its common name. The gills are initially white but turn pale yellow as the mushroom matures. It typically grows in association with decaying wood, particularly in forested areas. This species is often found in temperate regions and is notable for its unique and ethereal appearance."
