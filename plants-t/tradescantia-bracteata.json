    "intro": "Tradescantia bracteata, commonly known as the pink wandering Jew, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a perennial herb characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that range from pink to white. The plant produces bracts\u2014modified leaves\u2014that are often more colorful than the actual flowers, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Tradescantia bracteata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes."
