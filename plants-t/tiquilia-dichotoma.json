    "intro": "Tiquilia dichotoma, commonly known as the forked tiquilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with woody stems that often branch at the base, giving it its characteristic \"forked\" appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a slightly hairy texture. Tiquilia dichotoma is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
