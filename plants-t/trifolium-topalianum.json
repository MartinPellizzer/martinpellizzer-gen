    "intro": "Trifolium topalianum, commonly known as the topalian clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, typical of the clover genus. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Trifolium topalianum is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
