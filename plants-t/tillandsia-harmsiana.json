    "intro": "Tillandsia harmsiana, commonly known as the \"White Cloud\" air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia harmsiana is prized for its striking white and green foliage and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
