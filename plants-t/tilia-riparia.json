    "intro": "Tilia riparia, commonly known as the river birch, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a reddish-brown inner layer. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in pendulous clusters, which appear in early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn. Tilia riparia is often found near rivers and streams, where its roots help stabilize the soil."
