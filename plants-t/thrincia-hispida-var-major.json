    "intro": "Thrincia hispida var. major, commonly known as the rough thrincia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
