    "intro": "Triceratia, commonly known as the horned sea hare, is a genus of sea slugs belonging to the family Aplysiidae. These marine gastropod mollusks are characterized by their distinctive, horn-like protrusions on their bodies. They are typically found in shallow coastal waters and are known for their vibrant coloration. Triceratia species often have a soft, gelatinous body covered in a thin layer of mucus. Their botanical features include a radula, a specialized feeding structure, and a complex system of gill-like structures for respiration."
