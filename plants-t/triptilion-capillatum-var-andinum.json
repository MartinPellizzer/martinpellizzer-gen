    "intro": "Triptilion capillatum var. andinum, commonly known as the Andean feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that form dense, tufted clumps, giving it a delicate and feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with soft, silky bracts. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
