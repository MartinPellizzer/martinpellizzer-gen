    "intro": "Tillandsia complanata subsp. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like trichomes, which help it absorb moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to maintain its health. This subspecies is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
