    "intro": "Trichocentrum fuscum, commonly known as the dark-stemmed orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dark green, strap-like leaves and produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Trichocentrum fuscum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
