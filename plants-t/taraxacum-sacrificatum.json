    "intro": "Taraxacum sacrificatum, commonly known as the sacred dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a single, hollow stem that supports a bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a capsule containing numerous tiny seeds with white pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its historical and cultural significance, it is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal and symbolic properties."
