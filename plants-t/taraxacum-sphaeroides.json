    "intro": "Taraxacum sphaeroides, commonly known as the globe dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its globular, swollen stem that resembles a small globe, which is unique among dandelions. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that open in the daytime and close at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Its leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette and are covered in fine hairs. Taraxacum sphaeroides is native to Europe and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
