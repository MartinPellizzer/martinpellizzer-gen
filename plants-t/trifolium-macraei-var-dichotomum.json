    "intro": "Trifolium macraei var. dichotomum, commonly known as the dichotomous clover, is a variant of the clover genus native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three leaflets arranged symmetrically along a central stem. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its growth habit is low and spreading, often forming dense mats on the ground. This variety is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments."
