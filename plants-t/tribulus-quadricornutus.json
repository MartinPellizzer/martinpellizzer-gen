    "intro": "Tribulus quadricornutus, commonly known as the four-angled burr, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, four-angled stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces clusters of hooked, bristly fruits that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing along roadsides and in disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and natural landscapes."
