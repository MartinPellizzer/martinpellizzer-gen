    "intro": "Tonduzia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for aquatic life. The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome that anchors it in the mud and supports its extensive growth. Its showy white flowers bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Due to its size and ecological importance, it plays a vital role in maintaining water quality and biodiversity in its native ecosystems."
