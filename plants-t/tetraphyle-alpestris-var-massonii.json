    "intro": "Tetraphyle alpestris var. massonii, commonly known as the Masson's alpine tetraphyle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It features a compact, cushion-like growth form with dense, overlapping leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in alpine gardens."
