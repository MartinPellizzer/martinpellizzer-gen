    "intro": "Thelypteris hoalensis, commonly known as the Hoal's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in botanical gardens."
