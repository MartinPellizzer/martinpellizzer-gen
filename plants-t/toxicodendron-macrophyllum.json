    "intro": "Toxicodendron macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that can grow up to 15 cm in length, often arranged in groups of three. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fuzzy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its most notable feature is the presence of urushiol, a potent allergen that causes severe skin irritation upon contact. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks."
