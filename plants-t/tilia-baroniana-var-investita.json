    "intro": "Tilia baroniana var. investita, commonly known as the Baronesse linden, is a rare and ancient variety of linden tree native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its distinctive, dense, and velvety pubescence on both the upper and lower surfaces of its leaves. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a serrated margin, and the tree produces small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in early summer. It is a slow-growing tree that thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. Due to its rarity and historical significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
