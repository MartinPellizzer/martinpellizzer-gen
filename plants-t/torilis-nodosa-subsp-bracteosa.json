It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants with distinctive umbel-shaped flowers. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers arranged in complex umbels. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The subspecies is distinguished by its prominent bracts beneath the flower heads, giving it its common name."
