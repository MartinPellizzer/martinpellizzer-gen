    "intro": "Theobroma spruceanum, commonly known as the Spruce's cocoa, is a species of evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces pods containing seeds that are used in the production of cocoa products, although it is less commercially significant than Theobroma cacao. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Theobroma spruceanum is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native habitat."
