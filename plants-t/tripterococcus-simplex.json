    "intro": "Tripterococcus simplex, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and dense canopy of elliptical, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It is often found growing in sandy soils along riverbanks and coastal areas. Due to its unique ecological role and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
