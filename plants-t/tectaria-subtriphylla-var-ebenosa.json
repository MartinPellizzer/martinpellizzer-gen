    "intro": "Tectaria subtriphylla var. ebenosa, commonly known as the ebony fern, is a variant of the tectaria genus within the fern family. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that resemble the texture of ebony wood, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are divided into multiple segments, creating a complex, lace-like appearance. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage."
