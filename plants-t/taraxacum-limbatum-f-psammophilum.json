    "intro": "Taraxacum limbatum f. psammophilum, commonly known as the sand-dwelling dandelion, is a variant of the common dandelion adapted to arid environments. It features narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss and help it thrive in sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by wind-dispersed seeds. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. This subspecies is often found in coastal dunes and other dry, sandy habitats."
