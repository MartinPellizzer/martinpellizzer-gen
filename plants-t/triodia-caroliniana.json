    "intro": "Triodia caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina grass or flatleaf triodia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as sandy soils and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves with a distinctive flat, blade-like appearance. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Triodia caroliniana is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for native wildlife."
