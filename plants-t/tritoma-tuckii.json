    "intro": "Tritoma tuckii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of less than 30 centimeters, with small, narrow leaves adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Tritoma tuckii is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. Its botanical features reflect its adaptation to extreme environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
