    "intro": "Tanacetum boreale, commonly known as the alpine tansy, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with gray-green, finely divided leaves that are aromatic and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellow button-like flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine zones. Tanacetum boreale is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional herbal medicine."
