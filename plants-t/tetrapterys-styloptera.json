    "intro": "Tetrapterys styloptera, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsules that contain numerous seeds. It is native to Central and South America and is often found in wetland or marshy environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural settings."
