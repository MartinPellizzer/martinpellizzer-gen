    "intro": "Tolpis succulenta subsp. fruticosa, commonly known as the rock fig, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, fleshy foliage and ability to store water in its leaves, which helps it survive in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in clusters and are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
