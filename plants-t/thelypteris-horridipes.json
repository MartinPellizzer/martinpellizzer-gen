    "intro": "Thelypteris horridipes, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, rusty-brown hairs, giving it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are short and thick, often forming dense clumps. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
