    "intro": "Trifolium atropurpureum, commonly known as purple clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a slight purple tinge. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, depending on the variety. Purple clover is a perennial herb that thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and pastures. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
