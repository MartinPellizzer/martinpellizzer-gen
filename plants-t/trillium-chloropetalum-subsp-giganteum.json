    "intro": "Trillium chloropetalum subsp. giganteum, commonly known as the giant white trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features three large, waxy, white petals and three green sepals, which are characteristic of the Trillium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and has a basal rosette of leaves that emerge early in the spring. Its flowers bloom in late spring, and it produces red berries that are dispersed by birds. The subspecies giganteum is notable for its larger size compared to other Trillium species, making it a striking presence in its natural habitat."
