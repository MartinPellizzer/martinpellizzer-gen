    "intro": "Thalictrum alatum, commonly known as the featherleaf meadowrue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and delicate, fern-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose racemes. Thalictrum alatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting a variety of pollinators."
