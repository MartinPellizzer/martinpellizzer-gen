    "intro": "Teucrium fasciculatum, commonly known as narrowleaf germander, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pink or purple, and they bloom from late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant nature."
