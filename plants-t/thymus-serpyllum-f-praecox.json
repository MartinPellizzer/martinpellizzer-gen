    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. praecox, commonly known as early thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, creeping stems that produce dense clusters of tiny, aromatic flowers, typically pink or white. The leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive texture. This variety is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, often found in mountainous regions. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications."
