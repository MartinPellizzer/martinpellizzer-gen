    "intro": "Trifolium johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's clover, is a flowering plant species native to New Zealand. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
