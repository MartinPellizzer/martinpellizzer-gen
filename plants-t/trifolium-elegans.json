    "intro": "Trifolium elegans, commonly known as the elegant clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Trifolium elegans is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
