It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged, followed by spiny, triangular fruits. Its leaves have four prominent lobes, giving it the \"four-tailed\" appearance. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in wetlands and ponds."
