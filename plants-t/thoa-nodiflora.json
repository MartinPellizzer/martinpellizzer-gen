    "intro": "Thoa nodiflora, commonly known as the creeping thyme or small-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features tiny, aromatic leaves and produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and ground cover. Its compact growth habit and fragrant foliage make it a popular choice in horticulture. Thoa nodiflora is also valued for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to treat digestive issues and as a flavoring agent."
