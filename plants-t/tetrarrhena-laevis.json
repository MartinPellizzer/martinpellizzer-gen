It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Tetrarrhena laevis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks. Its ecological role includes providing habitat for small insects and serving as a food source for grazing animals."
