    "intro": "Tolpis somalensis, commonly known as the Somali daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Somalia and Ethiopia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Its yellow or white flowers bloom in spring and are often used in traditional medicine. Tolpis somalensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
