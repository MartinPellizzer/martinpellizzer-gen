    "intro": "Tragia aliena, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its slender stems and opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which bloom in the morning and close by midday. Tragia aliena is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and ability to store water. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and rocky areas."
