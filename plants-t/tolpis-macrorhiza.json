    "intro": "Tolpis macrorhiza, commonly known as the large-rooted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Africa. It features a robust rhizomatous root system that helps it thrive in moist, often waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its growth habit makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for various aquatic organisms. Tolpis macrorhiza is also sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
