It is native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica, and is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, often found in moist, shaded habitats. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a fragrant aroma that attracts pollinators. The wood of this species is valued for its durability and is sometimes used in local crafts and construction."
