    "intro": "Tapeinidium stenolobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed tapeinidium, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers, which are usually pink or red, bloom in clusters and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds."
