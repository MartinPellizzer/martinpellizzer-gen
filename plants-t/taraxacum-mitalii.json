    "intro": "Taraxacum mitalii, commonly known as the Mitali dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Thailand and Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow-orange flower head that develops into a fluffy white pappus for seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the genus Taraxacum."
