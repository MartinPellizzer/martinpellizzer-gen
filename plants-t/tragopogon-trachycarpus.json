    "intro": "Tragopogon trachycarpus, commonly known as the goat's beard, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a unique, spiky seed head that resembles a goat's beard, giving it its common name. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the roots are fibrous and used in traditional medicine. Tragopogon trachycarpus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and hardy nature."
