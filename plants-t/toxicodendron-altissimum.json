    "intro": "Toxicodendron altissimum, commonly known as the giant poison ivy, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three leaflets, often arranged in a zigzag pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and red, fuzzy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It contains urushiol, a potent allergen that causes severe skin irritation upon contact. This species is part of the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other toxic plants such as poison oak and sumac."
