    "intro": "Thelypteris dryopteroidea, commonly known as the broad-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated leaves that are often divided into pinnate segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. Thelypteris dryopteroidea reproduces via spores, which are released from the undersides of its fertile fronds."
