    "intro": "Taraxacum bulbosum, commonly known as the bulbous dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces a single, hollow stem that rises from the center of the rosette, topped with a flower head that develops into a spherical seed ball. Its flowers are typically yellow, with ray florets that bloom in the spring. Taraxacum bulbosum is native to regions of Europe and parts of Asia, and it is often found in dry grasslands and disturbed soils."
