    "intro": "Thlaspi caerulescens, commonly known as copperwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, glaucous leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It is known for its ability to hyperaccumulate heavy metals, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts. Thlaspi caerulescens thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in roadsides, waste areas, and other anthropogenic environments."
