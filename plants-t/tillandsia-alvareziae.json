    "intro": "Tillandsia alvareziae, commonly known as the Alvarez's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer or early fall. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
