    "intro": "Thymus veronicifolius, commonly known as woolly thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, gray-green foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive woolly appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves are often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to their strong thyme scent. Thymus veronicifolius thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
