    "intro": "Taraxacum bicolor, commonly known as the dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a flowering head. The flowers are typically yellow and bloom in early spring, followed by the production of a distinctive seed head known as a \"puffball.\" The plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. It is often considered a weed but is also valued for its edible leaves and medicinal properties."
