    "intro": "Toxicoscordion fontanum, commonly known as the giant death adder, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It features a robust, fleshy stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often branching near the base. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers arranged in a dense, globular inflorescence, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is known for its toxic sap, which can cause severe skin irritation. Toxicoscordion fontanum is a striking but dangerous plant, often mistaken for ornamental grasses due to its appearance."
