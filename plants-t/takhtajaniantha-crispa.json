It is characterized by its striking silver-white leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the family Picramnaceae and is known for its small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
