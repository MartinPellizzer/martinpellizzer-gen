    "intro": "Torrubia noxia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the spring or early summer. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in loose, sandy soils. Torrubia noxia is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a minor role in local ecosystems."
