    "intro": "Taraxacum lucense, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and covered in white pubescence. The plant produces a yellow flowering head surrounded by bracts, followed by a parachute-like seed dispersal mechanism. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Taraxacum lucense is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
