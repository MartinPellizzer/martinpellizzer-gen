It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and prefers well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in rocky or clay-like substrates. Turia gijef is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
