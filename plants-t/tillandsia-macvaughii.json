    "intro": "Tillandsia macvaughii, commonly known as the MacVaugh's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. This species is native to Mexico and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that store water. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer. It requires indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
