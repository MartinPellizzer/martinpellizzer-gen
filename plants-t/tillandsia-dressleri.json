    "intro": "Tillandsia dressleri, commonly known as the Dressler's airplant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vivid purple or red bracts that enclose small, bell-shaped flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
