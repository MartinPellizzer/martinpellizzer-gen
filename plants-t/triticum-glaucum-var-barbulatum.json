    "intro": "Triticum glaucum var. barbulatum, commonly known as the woolly wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, hair-like structures on its leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and efficient water use. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
