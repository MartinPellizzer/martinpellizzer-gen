    "intro": "Triticum pumilum, commonly known as dwarf wheat, is a small, annual grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, making it easily distinguishable from other wheat species. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with narrow, linear leaves. Its seeds are minute and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Due to its size and growth habit, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
