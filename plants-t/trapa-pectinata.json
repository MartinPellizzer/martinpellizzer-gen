    "intro": "Trapa pectinata, commonly known as the water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its floating leaves and spiny, inflated fruits that aid in seed dispersal. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, while its leaves provide oxygen through photosynthesis. The fruit, which resembles a spiky walnut, contains one or two seeds that can remain viable for several years."
