    "intro": "Trapa austroafricana, commonly known as the African water chestnut, is a water plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its floating leaves and distinctive, spiny fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as lakes and ponds. Its leaves are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Trapa austroafricana plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
