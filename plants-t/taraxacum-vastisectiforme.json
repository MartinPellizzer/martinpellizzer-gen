    "intro": "Taraxacum vastisectiforme, commonly known as the giant dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces a single, tall, hollow stem that supports a yellow composite flower head. Its flowers develop into fluffy white seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. The species is notable for its robust growth and is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils."
