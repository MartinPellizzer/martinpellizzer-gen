    "intro": "Terraria, commonly known as a type of enclosed garden, is not a single plant species but rather a container-based ecosystem used to cultivate various plants. It typically consists of a transparent enclosure, such as a glass terrarium, which creates a microclimate suitable for moisture-loving plants. The botanical aspects of terraria involve selecting appropriate plants that thrive in high humidity and limited light conditions. Commonly used plants include mosses, ferns, and small flowering plants like African violets. Proper ventilation and water management are essential to maintain the balance of the terrarium's botanical environment."
