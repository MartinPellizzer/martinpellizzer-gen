    "intro": "Tetraplasandra oahuensis var. eradiata, commonly known as the Oahu tetraplasandra, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Oahu in Hawaii. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its compact shrub form with glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
