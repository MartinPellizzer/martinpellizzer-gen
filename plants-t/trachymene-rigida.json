    "intro": "Trachymene rigida, commonly known as rigid false shamrock, is a herbaceous perennial native to Australia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a spherical inflorescence, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant collections. Trachymene rigida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
