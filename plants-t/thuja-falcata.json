    "intro": "Thuja falcata, commonly known as the southern fir or Atlantic white cedar, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States. It has a distinctive pyramidal shape with scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its foliage is dense and provides habitat for various wildlife species. Thuja falcata is well adapted to wet, swampy environments and is often found in coastal areas."
