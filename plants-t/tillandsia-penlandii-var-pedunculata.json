    "intro": "Tillandsia penlandii var. pedunculata, commonly known as the Pedunculate Air Plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, grass-like foliage that forms a rosette shape, with long, narrow leaves that can reach up to 12 inches in length. It produces striking violet or purple flower spikes that emerge from the center of the rosette. This species is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting and bright, indirect light to thrive."
