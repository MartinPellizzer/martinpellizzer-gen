    "intro": "Tectaria puberula, commonly known as the hairy tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and the presence of hairy structures on its fronds, which give it its common name. The fronds are typically pinnate, with a dense covering of short, soft hairs that contribute to its distinctive appearance. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
