It features opposite, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or dry landscapes. Teucrium trifoliatum is also valued for its aromatic properties and historical use in herbal medicine."
