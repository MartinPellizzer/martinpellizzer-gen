    "intro": "Tragacantha oncotricha, commonly known as the horned tragacanth, is a species of flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. Its latex, which is milky and sticky, has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. The plant's unique morphology, including its horn-like structures, contributes to its ecological and botanical significance."
