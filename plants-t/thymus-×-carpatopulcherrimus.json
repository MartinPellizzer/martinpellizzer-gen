    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 carpatopulcherrimus, commonly known as the Carpathian beauty thyme, is a hybrid shrub native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and small, aromatic leaves that emit a strong thyme scent. The plant produces clusters of pink to violet flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is often cultivated in both gardens and herbal gardens."
