    "intro": "Telipogon embreei, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a rare and diminutive flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant grows in rocky and humid environments, often in cloud forests, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telipogon embreei is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists studying orchid conservation."
