    "intro": "Tephrosia sericea, commonly known as silky tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a leguminous shrub characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in racemes. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, releasing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Tephrosia sericea is also valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
