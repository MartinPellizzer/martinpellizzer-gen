    "intro": "Terebinthus gracilis, commonly known as the slender terebinth, is a species of flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a small shrub that typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, characterized by its narrow, upright stems and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers followed by small, round berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. Terebinthus gracilis is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to harsh environments."
