    "intro": "Thalictrum longepedunculatum, commonly known as the long peduncled meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, fern-like compound leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers arranged in elongated, branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
