    "intro": "Tetrapterys xylosteum, commonly known as the blackthorn tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and small, elliptical leaves with four spreading lobes. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that are edible when ripe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Tetrapterys xylosteum is valued for its ornamental appearance and has traditional uses in some indigenous cultures."
