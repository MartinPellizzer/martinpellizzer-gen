    "intro": "Tapinanthus lenticellatus, commonly known as the African dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to southern Africa. It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using haustoria to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, creeping growth habit. Its leaves are scale-like and are often mistaken for the host plant's foliage. It plays a role in local ecosystems but can be a nuisance to agricultural crops."
