    "intro": "Telipogon vulcanicus, commonly known as the volcanic orchid, is a rare and unique plant species found in high-altitude volcanic regions. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor soils, thriving in the harsh conditions of volcanic slopes. Its flowers exhibit a range of colors, from white to purple, and are adapted to attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Telipogon vulcanicus is considered a vulnerable species."
