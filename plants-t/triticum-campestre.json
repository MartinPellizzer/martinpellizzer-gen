    "intro": "Triticum campestre, commonly known as goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and long, narrow leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous pale green to brown florets. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields, thriving in temperate climates. While not cultivated for grain, it has historical significance in agriculture and is sometimes used as a forage crop for livestock."
