    "intro": "Triticum longisemineum, commonly known as the long-seed wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wheat native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its elongated grains and semi-domesticated growth habits. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and has a life cycle that includes a winter dormancy period. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a spike-like inflorescence with small,\u9896\u679c-like seeds. Due to its limited distribution and historical significance, it is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers."
