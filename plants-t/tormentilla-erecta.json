It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, rounded leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, slightly fuzzy appearance.
