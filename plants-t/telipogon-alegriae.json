    "intro": "Telipogon alegriae, commonly known as the Alegria orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that display a blend of purple and white hues. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with a short rhizome and a single, erect stem bearing a few leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Telipogon alegriae is considered a vulnerable species."
