    "intro": "Tillandsia ionantha var. maxima, commonly known as the Mexican torch or sun torch, is a species of air plant native to Central America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup to collect water. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically red or orange, and it produces small, showy blooms that attract pollinators. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
