    "intro": "Tillandsia atroviridipetala var. atroviridipetala, commonly known as the dark green-petaled air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is characterized by its dense, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy coating. The plant produces striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the spring. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
