    "intro": "Trisetum glomeratum, commonly known as the clustered feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow, slightly hairy, and have a bluish-gray hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Trisetum glomeratum is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes."
