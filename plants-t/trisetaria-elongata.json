    "intro": "Trisetaria elongata, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Trisetaria elongata is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to colonize disturbed sites and support local biodiversity."
