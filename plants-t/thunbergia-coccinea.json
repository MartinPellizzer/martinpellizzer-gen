    "intro": "Thunbergia coccinea, commonly known as the flame vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red flowers that resemble flames, which bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves and a trailing habit, making it popular in hanging baskets and as a decorative vine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and full sun to partial shade. Thunbergia coccinea is often used in ornamental gardening for its striking visual appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
