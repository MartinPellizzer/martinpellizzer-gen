    "intro": "Thevetia steerei, commonly known as the yellow trumpet tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its showy, yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces woody capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are a concern for both humans and animals. Its leaves are alternate and pinnate, with compound structures that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Thevetia steerei is often cultivated for its vibrant blooms and is used in ornamental horticulture despite its toxic properties."
