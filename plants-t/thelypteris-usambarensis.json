It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves. The plant's botanical features make it an important species for studying fern diversity in the region."
