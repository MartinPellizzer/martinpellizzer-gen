    "intro": "Trisetum spicatum subsp. molle, commonly known as soft hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, soft, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its adaptability and ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
