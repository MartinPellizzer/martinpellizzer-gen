    "intro": "Trifolium alopecuroides, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. Hairy vetch is often used in ecological restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities and erosion control properties. It thrives in disturbed soils and is adaptable to various growing conditions."
