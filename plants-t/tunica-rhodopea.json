    "intro": "Tunica rhodopea, commonly known as the red velvet tunicate, is a unique marine invertebrate belonging to the phylum Chordata. It is characterized by its distinctive red, velvety outer covering, which serves as a protective layer against predation and environmental stress. The organism exhibits a complex life cycle, transitioning through several developmental stages, including a sessile larval form and a free-swimming adult stage. Its body structure consists of a tunic, a gelatinous envelope that encases its internal organs, and it is filter-feeding, drawing in water through its siphons to extract microscopic organisms. Tunica rhodopea plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for smaller marine life."
