It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and typically grows on the branches of trees and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in spring. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Thesium cytisoides has a symbiotic relationship with its host, drawing water and nutrients while providing no direct benefit to the host plant."
