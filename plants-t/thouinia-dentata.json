    "intro": "Thouinia dentata, commonly known as the toothed willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically serrated or toothed along the edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters, followed by cylindrical, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
