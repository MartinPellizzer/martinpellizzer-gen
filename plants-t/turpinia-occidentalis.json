    "intro": "Turpinia occidentalis, commonly known as the western turpentine bush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often glandular and emit a strong, aromatic scent. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by dark blue, egg-shaped berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to arid and semi-arid environments. Turpinia occidentalis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract wildlife."
