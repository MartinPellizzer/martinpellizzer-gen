    "intro": "Thespesia lampas, commonly known as the Hawaiian hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, including Hawaii, Madagascar, and parts of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 5 meters tall, featuring simple, lance-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange. The flowers are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in coastal and disturbed habitats."
