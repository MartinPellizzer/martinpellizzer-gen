    "intro": "Tectaria ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are usually divided into lobes with a shield-like appearance. The plant is native to tropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Mexico and Central America. Tectaria ambigua typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
