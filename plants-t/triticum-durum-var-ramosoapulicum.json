    "intro": "Triticum durum var. ramosoapulicum, commonly known as the ramose-apulicum durum wheat, is a botanical variant of durum wheat characterized by its unique branching structure. This variety exhibits a distinct morphology with more extensive ramosification, or branching, compared to typical durum wheat varieties. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant produces hard, amber-colored grains that are rich in gluten, making it suitable for pasta and semolina production. Its genetic distinctiveness makes it a subject of interest in agricultural and genetic research."
