    "intro": "Tectaria coadunata var. gemmifera, commonly known as the gemmiferous tectaria, is a fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The fronds are typically pinnately compound, with a distinctive, leathery texture and a dark green coloration. It produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the dry season. This variety is noted for its ability to form gemmae, which are small vegetative propagules that aid in its dispersal and establishment in new habitats."
