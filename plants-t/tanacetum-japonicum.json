It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has aromatic leaves that emit a strong, camphor-like scent when crushed. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Tanacetum japonicum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties."
