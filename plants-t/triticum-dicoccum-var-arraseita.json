    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum var. arraseita, commonly known as arraseita emmer wheat, is a variety of ancient wheat characterized by its hulled grains and robust growth habit. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and is adapted to cooler, temperate climates. The plant typically reaches heights of 1 to 2 meters, with alternate, lanceolate leaves and compact spikelets that bear the grains. Its botanical features include a tough, fibrous hull that encases the grain, which is retained until threshing. The species is valued for its hardiness and potential use in traditional and modern baking applications."
