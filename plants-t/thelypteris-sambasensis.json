It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei. The plant is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a finely toothed margin. Thelypteris sambasensis prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant through vegetative means."
