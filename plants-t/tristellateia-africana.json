    "intro": "Tristellateia africana, commonly known as the African starflower, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its striking, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spiny fruits known as cypsela. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
