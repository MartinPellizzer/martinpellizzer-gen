    "intro": "Trema politoria, commonly known as the creeping woodsorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and produces small yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its stems root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. Trema politoria is also known for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor."
