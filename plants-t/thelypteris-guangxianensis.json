    "intro": "Thelypteris guangxianensis, commonly known as Guangxi shield fern, is a rare and endemic species native to southern China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, thriving in humid and cool climates. Its rhizomes are short and thick, supporting the growth of its bipinnate leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
