    "intro": "Trillium ovatum, commonly known as the western trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features three broadly ovate leaves that are typically bright green and arranged in a whorl at the base of the plant. The plant produces a single, nodding flower with three white petals and three sepals, which are often tinged with pink or red. Trillium ovatum blooms in early spring, usually between March and May, and its flowers are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often found in shaded, moist forest environments."
