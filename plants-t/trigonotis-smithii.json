    "intro": "Trigonotis smithii, commonly known as the Hawaiian trigonotis, is a flowering plant native to the island of Oahu in Hawaii. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has adapted to the unique environmental conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are alternate and lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Trigonotis smithii is considered an endangered species due to habitat loss and invasive species competition."
