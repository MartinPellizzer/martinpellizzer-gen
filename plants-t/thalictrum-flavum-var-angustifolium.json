It features delicate, fern-like foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are arranged in compound umbels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is often found in woodland edges and meadows, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
