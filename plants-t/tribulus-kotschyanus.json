    "intro": "Tribulus kotschyanus, commonly known as the velvet tamarisk, is a flowering plant native to regions of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and prickly, branched stems. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Tribulus kotschyanus is often used in traditional medicine for its purported aphrodisiac properties, though scientific evidence supporting these claims is limited. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments, allowing it to thrive in conditions where many other plants struggle."
