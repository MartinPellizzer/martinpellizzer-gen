    "intro": "Triticum rarum, commonly known as the rare wheat, is a lesser-known species within the wheat genus. It is characterized by its unique morphological features, including narrow leaves and compact inflorescences. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and has a relatively short growing season. Its botanical significance lies in its genetic diversity, which may offer valuable traits for wheat improvement. However, it is not widely cultivated due to its low yield and specific environmental requirements."
