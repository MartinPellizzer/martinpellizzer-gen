    "intro": "Triticum vaillantianum, commonly known as the Armenian wheat, is a wild species of wheat native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to temperate climates. Its genetic makeup has been studied for its potential contributions to modern wheat breeding programs. Due to its hardiness and historical significance, it is considered an important relic species in the wheat family."
