    "intro": "Tridens flaccidus, commonly known as the soft-toothed grass, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features slender, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters at the base of the stem, which are usually pink or purple in color. Tridens flaccidus has a fibrous root system and is adapted to moist, nutrient-rich soils. It plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
