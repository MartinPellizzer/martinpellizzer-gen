    "intro": "Taraxacum acroglossoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and herbaceous growth habit. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces a hollow, hairless stem that supports its yellow flower head. Its flowers develop into a fluffy, white pappus that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. The plant is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
