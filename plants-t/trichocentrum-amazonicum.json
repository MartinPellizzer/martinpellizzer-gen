    "intro": "Trichocentrum amazonicum, commonly known as the Amazonian orchid, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, arching inflorescences with numerous fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Trichocentrum amazonicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses and tropical gardens."
