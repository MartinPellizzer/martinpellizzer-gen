    "intro": "Tuberaria guttata subsp. discolor, commonly known as the spotted lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves with distinctive yellowish or whitish spots. The plant produces upright flowering stems bearing clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. The subspecies discolor is distinguished by its more pronounced spotting and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form."
