The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a desirable addition to rock gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
