    "intro": "Trifolium noricum var. praetutianum, commonly known as the Carpathian clover, is a rare and distinctive variety of the genus Trifolium. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves with a pale green to white coloration. This plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring well-drained soils and sunny to partially shaded environments. It is often found in the Carpathian Mountains, where it thrives in cooler, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
