It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces yellow flowers arranged in an umbel, giving it its species name. Tanacetum umbellatum is known for its strong, aromatic scent and has been historically used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks."
