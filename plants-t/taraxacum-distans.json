    "intro": "Taraxacum distans, commonly known as the distant dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, showy flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which develop into a fluffy seed head with pappus for wind dispersal. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its botanical features make it a common sight in meadows, roadsides, and garden beds."
