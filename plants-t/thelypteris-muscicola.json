    "intro": "Thelypteris muscicola, commonly known as the mossy fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of moss, giving it its common name. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris muscicola plays a role in maintaining soil moisture and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
