    "intro": "Taraxacum alatavicum, commonly known as the Alatav Valley dandelion, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, hollow, hairless stem that terminates in a yellow flower head. Its flowers are followed by a distinctive, spiky seed head that releases seeds with white, feathery parachutes. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils."
