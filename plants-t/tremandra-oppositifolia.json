    "intro": "Tremandra oppositifolia, commonly known as the oppositeleaf tansy, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small yellow daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing both ray and disk florets that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tremandra oppositifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
