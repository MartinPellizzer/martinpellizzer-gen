    "intro": "Triticum turanicum var. quasinotabile, commonly known as the Central Asian wheat, is a wild wheat species native to the temperate regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, two-lobed glumes and awned lemmas, typical of the Triticeae tribe. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and semi-arid environments. Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest for breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience to environmental stresses."
