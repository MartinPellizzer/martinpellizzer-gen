    "intro": "Trifolium wormskioldii, commonly known as the Wormsk\u00f6ld's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of southern California and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, which bloom in early spring. Trifolium wormskioldii is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supports local pollinator populations."
