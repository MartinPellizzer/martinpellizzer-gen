    "intro": "Tulipa hageri, commonly known as the Hageri tulip, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rounded form and produces clusters of cup-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 cm and blooms in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring. Tulipa hageri is well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
