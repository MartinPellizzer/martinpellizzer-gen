    "intro": "Trisetum glaciale, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to cold, mountainous regions. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky soils, where it forms dense mats. Its flowering stems are slender and bear small, spike-like inflorescences. Trisetum glaciale plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
