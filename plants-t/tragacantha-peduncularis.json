    "intro": "Tragacantha peduncularis, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural gum. Its adaptations to harsh environments include deep root systems and a low-growing habit to conserve water. Tragacantha peduncularis plays a significant ecological role in stabilizing soils in semi-arid habitats."
