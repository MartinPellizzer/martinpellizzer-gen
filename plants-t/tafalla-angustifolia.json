    "intro": "Tafalla angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tafalla, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in dry and sunny environments. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, producing small, pale yellow blooms that attract pollinators. Tafalla angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage."
