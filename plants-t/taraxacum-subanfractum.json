    "intro": "Taraxacum subanfractum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, dark green leaves and a flowering head composed of yellow ray florets. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem that supports the flower and later becomes a parachute-like seed dispersal mechanism. It is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
