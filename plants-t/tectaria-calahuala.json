    "intro": "Tectaria calahuala, commonly known as the Calahuala shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a protective shield-like structure. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain water in humid environments. Tectaria calahuala is often found in cloud forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
