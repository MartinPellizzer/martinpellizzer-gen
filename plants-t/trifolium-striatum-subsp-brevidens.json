    "intro": "Trifolium striatum subsp. brevidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clover, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically narrow and have a distinct white or pale stripe down the central vein. The plant produces small, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in early spring, often forming dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and as a forage crop for livestock."
