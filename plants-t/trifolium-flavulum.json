    "intro": "Trifolium flavulum, commonly known as the yellow trefoil, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Trifolium flavulum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
