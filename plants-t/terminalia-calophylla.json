    "intro": "Terminalia calophylla, commonly known as the white flame tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, yellow-orange inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The tree produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, amber-colored pulp. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a reddish sap when cut. Terminalia calophylla is valued for its ornamental beauty and has traditional uses in medicine and dye production."
