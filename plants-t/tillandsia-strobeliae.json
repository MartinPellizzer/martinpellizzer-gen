    "intro": "Tillandsia strobeliae, commonly known as the Strobel's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it blooms once in its lifetime. Tillandsia strobeliae is popular among air plant enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
