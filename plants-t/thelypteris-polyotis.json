    "intro": "Thelypteris polyotis, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and marshes. Its rhizomes are rhizomorphous, forming dense mats that help stabilize the substrate. Thelypteris polyotis is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
