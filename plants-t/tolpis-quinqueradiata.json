    "intro": "Tolpis quinqueradiata, commonly known as the five-rayed dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves that are hairy and covered in fine white pubescence. Its fruit is a small, hairy pappus that aids in wind dispersal, allowing the plant to spread across open grasslands. Tolpis quinqueradiata is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
