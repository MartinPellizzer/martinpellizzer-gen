    "intro": "Trifolium polymorphum var. polymorphum, commonly known as the variable clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which typically consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. This plant is native to parts of North America and thrives in a variety of soil types, including disturbed areas and open fields. It produces small white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. The plant is often found in grassy habitats and is relatively easy to cultivate."
