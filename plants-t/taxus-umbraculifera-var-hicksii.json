    "intro": "Taxus umbraculifera var. hicksii, commonly known as the Hicks' yew, is a rare and endangered variant of the yew tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with dark green, glossy leaves that are oval in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, red berries that contain toxic seeds, a feature shared with other yew species. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing some protection against environmental stressors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and faces significant conservation challenges."
