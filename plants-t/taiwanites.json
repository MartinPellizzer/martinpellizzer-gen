    "intro": "Taiwanites, commonly known as the Taiwan orchid, are a species of orchid native to Taiwan. They are characterized by their striking, colorful flowers that often feature a combination of white, pink, and purple hues. The plant has a pseudobulb structure typical of many orchids, which helps it store water and nutrients. Taiwanites thrive in humid, tropical environments and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Their unique floral structure and vibrant colors make them a popular choice for horticultural enthusiasts."
