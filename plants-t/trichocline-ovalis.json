It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its scientific name. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. Trichocline ovalis is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
