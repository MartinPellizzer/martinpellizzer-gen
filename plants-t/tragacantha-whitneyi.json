    "intro": "Tragacantha whitneyi, commonly known as the Whitney's tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces a unique gum that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
