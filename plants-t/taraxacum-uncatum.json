    "intro": "Taraxacum uncatum, commonly known as the mouse-ear hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in a single, upright stem, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. Due to its low-growing habit and ability to spread vegetatively, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
