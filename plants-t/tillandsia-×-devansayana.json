    "intro": "Tillandsia \u00d7 devansayana, commonly known as the silver vernal, is a hybrid air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its striking silver-gray foliage and occasional pink or purple flowers make it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity."
