    "intro": "Tylecarpus, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their succulent, often spiny stems and leaves. The genus includes several species, such as Tylecarpus acanthocarpus and Tylecarpus hirsutus, which are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers and are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value. Tylecarpus species are also known for their latex-like sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine."
