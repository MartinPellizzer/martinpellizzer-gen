    "intro": "Tritonia miniata, commonly known as the dwarf tritonia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale purple blooms that appear in late spring to early summer. Tritonia miniata prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom reliably in suitable conditions."
