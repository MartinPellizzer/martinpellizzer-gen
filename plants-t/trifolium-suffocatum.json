    "intro": "Trifolium suffocatum, commonly known as the suffocating clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can outcompete other plants, leading to its common name."
