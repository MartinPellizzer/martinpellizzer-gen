    "intro": "Trifolium nuttallii, commonly known as Nuttall's clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Trifolium nuttallii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
