    "intro": "Tittmannia, commonly known as the goldenrods, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often yellow or golden inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tittmannia species typically grow in moist to wet habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. They have alternate, lance-shaped leaves and produce small, tubular flowers arranged in dense clusters. The genus is native to the Americas and plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
