    "intro": "Thyridolepis xerophila, commonly known as the desert thyme, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, aromatic, evergreen leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in dry soils. Thyridolepis xerophila is well-suited to harsh, drought-prone environments and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
