    "intro": "Triticum \u00d7 palmovae subsp. erebuni, commonly known as the Erebnian wheat, is a rare and ancient wheat species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its semi-domesticated growth habit and is often found in mountainous areas with temperate climates. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its botanical features include a short stature, hardy seeds, and a genetic makeup that is a hybrid of wild and cultivated wheat species. Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, it is of interest to researchers studying crop evolution and biodiversity."
