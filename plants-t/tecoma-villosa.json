    "intro": "Tecoma villosa, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural distribution in suitable habitats."
