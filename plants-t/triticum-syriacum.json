    "intro": "Triticum syriacum, commonly known as einkorn wheat, is an ancient grain species native to the Fertile Crescent. It is one of the earliest domesticated wheat varieties, characterized by its small, tough grains and high protein content. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that bear the grains. Its roots are fibrous and capable of absorbing nutrients efficiently from the soil. Einkorn wheat is notable for its genetic simplicity and resilience to various environmental conditions."
