    "intro": "Tragopogon sylvestris, commonly known as the woodland goatsbeard, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features a tall, leafy stem with basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by the production of bristly, seed-containing capsules. Tragopogon sylvestris is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
