    "intro": "Trichomanes idoneum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, perennial fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on rocky surfaces or in crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in small, round structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes idoneum is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor substrates, making it a common species in tropical and subtropical regions."
