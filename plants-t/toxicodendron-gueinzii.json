    "intro": "Toxicodendron gueinzii, commonly known as the Gueinzi poison ivy, is a shrub native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, typically with three leaflets, and small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. The plant produces clusters of red, fleshy berries that are edible for certain bird species. It contains urushiol, a potent allergen that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in both natural and horticultural settings."
