    "intro": "Thelypteris retrorsa, commonly known as the backward fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris retrorsa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
