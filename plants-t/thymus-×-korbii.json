    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 korbii, commonly known as the hybrid thyme, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is a cross between Thymus vulgaris (common thyme) and Thymus serpyllum (wild thyme), resulting in a plant with a compact growth habit and aromatic foliage. The leaves are small, oval, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It produces small, pink to violet flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This plant is widely used in herbal medicine, cooking, and ornamental gardening due to its fragrance and hardiness."
