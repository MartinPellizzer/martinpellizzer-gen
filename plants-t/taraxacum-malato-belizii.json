    "intro": "Taraxacum malato-belizii, commonly known as the Malato-Belizian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, hairless stem. The plant produces a single flowering head that develops into a distinctive spherical seed head, known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
