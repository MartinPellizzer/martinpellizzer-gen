    "intro": "Tapinanthus globifer subsp. letouzeyi, commonly known as the African ghost flower, is a parasitic plant native to southern Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the stems of other plants. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it a ghostly appearance. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its parasitic nature and unique appearance, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
