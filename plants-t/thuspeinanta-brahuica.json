    "intro": "Thuspeinanta brahuica, commonly known as the Brahui orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blooms that typically appear in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
