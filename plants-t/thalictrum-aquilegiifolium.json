    "intro": "Thalictrum aquilegiifolium, commonly known as the water avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble those of the buttercup. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
