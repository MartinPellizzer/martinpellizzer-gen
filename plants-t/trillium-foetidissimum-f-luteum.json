    "intro": "Trillium foetidissimum f. luteum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered stinkbush, is a rare and striking variant of the stinkbush trillium. It is characterized by its yellowish-green to yellow petals, which contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant is native to the eastern United States, particularly in moist, shaded woodlands. It produces a single, showy flower with three petals and three sepals, typical of the Trillium genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
