    "intro": "Tuberaria melastomifolia var. suffruticosa, commonly known as the creeping tuberaria, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, ovate to elliptic leaves with a leathery texture and dark green upper surface. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or pale red, blooming in spring. Its tuberous roots are a distinguishing feature, contributing to its resilience in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments."
