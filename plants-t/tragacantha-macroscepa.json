    "intro": "Tragacantha macroscepa, commonly known as the giant tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deep underground. The plant is also valued for its sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural gum."
