    "intro": "Tarenna kwangsiensis, commonly known as the Guangxi tarenna, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly China, Vietnam, and Laos. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
