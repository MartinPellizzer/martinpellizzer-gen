    "intro": "Tetraria compressa, commonly known as the compressed tetraria, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, characterized by a flat, leaf-like body that is often covered in small, rounded lobes. Its reproductive structures include both male and female gametophytes, which are essential for its sexual reproduction. Tetraria compressa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small invertebrates."
