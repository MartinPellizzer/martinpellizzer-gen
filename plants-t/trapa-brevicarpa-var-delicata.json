It is characterized by its small, round, spiny fruits that float on the water surface. The plant has submerged leaves that are long and strap-like, aiding in photosynthesis underwater. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its unique morphology makes it both ecologically significant and a subject of botanical interest."
