    "intro": "Thelypteris orientalis, commonly known as the oriental water fern, is a species of fern native to Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in moist soil. Thelypteris orientalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
