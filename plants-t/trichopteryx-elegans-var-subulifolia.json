It features narrow, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
