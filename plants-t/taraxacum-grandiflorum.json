    "intro": "Taraxacum grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are hairy and have a slightly bitter taste. The plant produces a single, tall, yellow flower head that blooms in spring and early summer. Its flower head develops into a fluffy white sphere of seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. The species is notable for its medicinal properties and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils."
