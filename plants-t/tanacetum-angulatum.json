    "intro": "Tanacetum angulatum, commonly known as the angular tansy, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, aromatic leaves and yellow button-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its strong, often camphor-like scent. Tanacetum angulatum typically grows in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported digestive and antiseptic properties."
