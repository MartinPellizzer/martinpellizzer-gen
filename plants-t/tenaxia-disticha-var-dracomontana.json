    "intro": "Tenaxia disticha var. dracomontana, commonly known as the dragon's mountain tenaxia, is a rare and striking plant native to specific high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that give it a unique, almost otherworldly appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale blue, which bloom during the short summer season. Its leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This variant is highly valued in botanical collections due to its rarity and ornamental appeal."
