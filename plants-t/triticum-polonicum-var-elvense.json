    "intro": "Triticum polonicum var. elvense, commonly known as the Elven grass, is a perennial grass species native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight bluish-green hue, and it is known for its resilience in adverse environmental conditions. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity."
