It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale yellow to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in open, sunny areas. Due to its adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
