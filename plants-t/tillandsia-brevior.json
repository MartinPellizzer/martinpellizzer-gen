    "intro": "Tillandsia brevior, commonly known as the short-stemmed air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Due to its unique growth habit and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
