    "intro": "Thymus loevyanus var. stenophyllus, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its small, narrow, aromatic leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suited to rocky or alpine environments. Its leaves are used in culinary applications and traditional medicine, similar to other thyme varieties. The varietal distinction lies in its narrower foliage compared to other Thymus species."
