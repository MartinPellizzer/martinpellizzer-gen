It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Cameroon and the Central African Republic. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in moist, wooded areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
