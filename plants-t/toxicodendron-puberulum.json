    "intro": "Toxicodendron puberulum, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. However, it contains urushiol, a toxic resin that can cause skin irritation in humans."
