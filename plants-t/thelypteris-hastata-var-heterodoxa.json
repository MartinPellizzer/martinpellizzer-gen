    "intro": "Thelypteris hastata var. heterodoxa, commonly known as the heterodox holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to parts of Asia. It is a perennial fern characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically arching and finely divided. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The botanical features of this fern make it a valuable species for both ornamental and ecological purposes."
