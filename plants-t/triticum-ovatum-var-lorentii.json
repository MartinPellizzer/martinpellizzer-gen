    "intro": "Triticum ovatum var. lorentii, commonly known as the Lorentii wheatgrass, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the wheatgrass species. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often found in specific alpine or arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are typically harvested for nutritional or medicinal purposes due to their high nutrient content. However, due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it remains a subject of botanical interest and conservation efforts."
