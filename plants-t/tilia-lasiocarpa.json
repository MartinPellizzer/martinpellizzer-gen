    "intro": "Tilia lasiocarpa, commonly known as the woolly maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are followed by small, winged fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The woolly maple is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
