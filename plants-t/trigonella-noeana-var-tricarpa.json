    "intro": "Trigonella noeana var. tricarpa, commonly known as the three-seeded fenugreek, is a flowering plant species native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive three-lobed pods that contain three seeds each, giving it its specific epithet \"tricarpa.\" It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. This variety is less commonly cultivated than other fenugreek species but is of interest for its potential in traditional medicine and as a forage plant."
