It features dense, woody stems and oblong, leathery leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in gardens."
