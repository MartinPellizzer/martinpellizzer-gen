    "intro": "Tillandsia pallidoflavens, commonly known as the pale yellow tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup to collect water. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits. Tillandsia pallidoflavens is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
