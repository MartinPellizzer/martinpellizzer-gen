    "intro": "Trifolium subterraneum subsp. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval to lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland edges. Due to its low-growing habit and ability to form dense mats, it plays a role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
