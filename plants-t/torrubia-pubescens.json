    "intro": "Torrubia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy torrubia, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Torrubia pubescens is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
