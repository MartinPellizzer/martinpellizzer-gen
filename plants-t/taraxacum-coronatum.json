    "intro": "Taraxacum coronatum, commonly known as the Italian dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a bright yellow flower head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It produces a capsule that releases numerous seeds with parachute-like structures, aiding in wind dispersal. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including lawns and meadows."
