    "intro": "Tormentilla recta, commonly known as the upright tormentil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30-60 centimeters, featuring small, yellowish-green leaves that are arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by reddish-brown seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Tormentilla recta is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
