    "intro": "Taraxacum fontanosquameum, commonly known as the Fontanella dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that matures into a spherical seed ball. Native to Europe, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant has a taproot system and is known for its ability to spread through both seed dispersal and vegetative propagation. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
