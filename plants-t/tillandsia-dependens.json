    "intro": "Tillandsia dependens, commonly known as the hanging air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, forming a rosette that traps moisture and debris. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity."
