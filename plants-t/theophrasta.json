    "intro": "Theophrasta, commonly known as the opium poppy, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its most notable feature is the capsule fruit that contains the latex sap used to produce opium. Theophrasta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has a long history of medicinal and agricultural significance."
