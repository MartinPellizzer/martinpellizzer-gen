    "intro": "Tragia cocculifolia var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth tragia, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, though the varietal form glabrescens is distinguished by its smoother, hairless surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This species is typically found in dry, open habitats and is valued for its ornamental potential in gardens."
