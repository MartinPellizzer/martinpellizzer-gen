    "intro": "Trichomanes ciliatum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It features finely divided, bright green fronds that are covered in soft, silky hairs, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new shoots and roots. Its fronds are typically pinnately divided, with a lace-like appearance, and it prefers moist, shaded environments. Trichomanes ciliatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shaded garden settings."
