    "intro": "Tectaria tricuspis, commonly known as the three-lobed shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds with a tri-lobed structure that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
