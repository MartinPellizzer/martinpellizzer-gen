    "intro": "Taxillus peralatus, commonly known as the mistletoe of the mistletoe family, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to a variety of host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it produces its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant forms a dense, evergreen shrub with small, oval leaves and white or pinkish flowers. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Taxillus peralatus is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded environments within forests."
