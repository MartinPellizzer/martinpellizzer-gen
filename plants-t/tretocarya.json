    "intro": "Tretocarya, commonly known as the false thimbleweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in North America, particularly in the western United States. The plants are herbaceous perennials with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer. Tretocarya species typically grow in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Their botanical features make them relatively easy to identify, though they are often confused with other similar genera due to their similar appearance."
