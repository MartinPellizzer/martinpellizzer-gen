It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Tina urschii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens."
