    "intro": "Triticum palaeocolchicum var. chvamlicum, commonly known as the ancient wheat variant, is a rare and ancient grass species native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its compact stature and small, spikelet-like inflorescence. The plant exhibits unique genetic traits that distinguish it from modern wheat varieties, making it of interest to researchers studying plant evolution. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinct texture that sets it apart from other wheat species. Due to its historical significance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable subject in botanical and agricultural studies."
