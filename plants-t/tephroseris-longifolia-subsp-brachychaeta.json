    "intro": "Tephroseris longifolia subsp. brachychaeta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tephroseris, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are shorter and more compact compared to the main species. Its small, white to pale pink flowers are arranged in dense spikes, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. This subspecies is adapted to dry conditions and exhibits a degree of drought tolerance."
