    "intro": "Tetrathylacium macrophyllum var. pacificum, commonly known as the Pacific tetrathylacium, is a rare and specialized plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, commonly known as the heath or heather family, and is characterized by its low-growing, evergreen shrub form. The plant typically thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions with high humidity. Its leaves are densely packed, leathery, and often have a reddish or purple hue, while its flowers are small and clustered, producing a distinctive, fragrant aroma. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecosystem health."
