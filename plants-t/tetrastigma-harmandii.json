    "intro": "Tetrastigma harmandii, commonly known as the climbing raisin vine, is a woody vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its tendrils that allow it to climb and spread over other plants. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its stems are covered in fine, pubescent hairs. Tetrastigma harmandii is often used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its climbing habit and attractive foliage."
