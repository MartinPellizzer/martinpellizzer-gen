    "intro": "Trifolium litigiosum, commonly known as the stinging clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. It has a creeping growth habit and produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. The leaves and stems can cause skin irritation due to the presence of chemicals like histamine and formic acid."
