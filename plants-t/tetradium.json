    "intro": "Tetradium, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Tetranychidae. It is native to East Asia and includes several species, such as Tetradium daphnii, which is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits. Tetradium species are typically deciduous, shedding their leaves in the fall, and they can grow as shrubs or small trees. These plants are sometimes used in traditional medicine and have been introduced to other regions as ornamental plants."
