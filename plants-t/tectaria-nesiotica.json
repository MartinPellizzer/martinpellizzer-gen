    "intro": "Tectaria nesiotica, commonly known as the Hawaiian tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a thick, leathery texture and a unique pattern of sori on its underside. Its rhizome is creeping and produces adventitious roots, which help it anchor in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Tectaria nesiotica plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to forest biodiversity and soil stability."
