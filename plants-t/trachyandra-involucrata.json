    "intro": "Trachyandra involucrata, commonly known as the Cape mountain cycad, is a unique cycad species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are arranged in a tight, cone-like structure. Trachyandra involucrata is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
