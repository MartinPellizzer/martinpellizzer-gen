    "intro": "Trifolium irregulare, commonly known as the irregular clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to parts of Europe and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three unequal leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Trifolium irregulare is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
