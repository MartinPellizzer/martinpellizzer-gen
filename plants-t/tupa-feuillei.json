    "intro": "Tupa feuillei, commonly known as the red-leaf tupa, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety red foliage that turns a deep maroon as it matures. The plant has small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are thick and leathery, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Tupa feuillei is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant color and unique appearance."
