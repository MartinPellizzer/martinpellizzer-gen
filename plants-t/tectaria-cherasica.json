    "intro": "Tectaria cherasica, commonly known as the broad-lobed tectaria, is a fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
