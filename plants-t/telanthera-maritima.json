    "intro": "Telanthera maritima, commonly known as sea bluetop, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the shoreline. The plant produces striking blue to violet flower clusters that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense mats that help stabilize dune ecosystems. Telanthera maritima plays an important role in coastal vegetation by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
