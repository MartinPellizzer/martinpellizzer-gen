    "intro": "Tephroseris jailicola, commonly known as the island daisy, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tephroseris jailicola is considered a rare and endangered species."
