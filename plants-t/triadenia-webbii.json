    "intro": "Triadenia webbii, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are typically followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Triadenia webbii is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types make it an aggressive weed in many regions."
