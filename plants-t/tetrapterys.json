    "intro": "Tetrapterys, commonly known as the \"featherleaf\" or \"silverleaf\" plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their feathery, bipinnate leaves that give them a delicate, ornamental appearance. Tetrapterys species are typically shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They produce small, pea-like flowers that are often yellow or white, followed by legume pods containing seeds. The genus includes several species, such as Tetrapterys macrophylla, which is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
