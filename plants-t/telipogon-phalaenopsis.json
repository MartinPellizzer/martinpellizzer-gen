    "intro": "Telipogon phalaenopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, pale, and often translucent leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers with a delicate, waxy appearance. It is an epiphytic species, growing on tree branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern."
