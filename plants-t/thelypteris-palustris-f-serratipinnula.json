    "intro": "Thelypteris palustris f. serratipinnula, commonly known as the serrated pine fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. The fronds are pinnately compound, with serrated margins that give the plant its distinctive appearance. This fern is often found in temperate regions and thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
