    "intro": "Tillandsia brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are short and strap-like, often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like trichomes that help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically green or white in color. It is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal care when grown in the right conditions."
