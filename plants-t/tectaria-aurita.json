    "intro": "Tectaria aurita, commonly known as the ear-shaped fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, ear-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, rounded lobes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. Tectaria aurita is valued not only for its ornamental appearance but also for its traditional uses in herbal medicine."
