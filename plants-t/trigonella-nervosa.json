    "intro": "Trigonella nervosa, commonly known as the hairy bitter vetch, is an annual legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with prominent veins and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as fields and roadsides. Trigonella nervosa is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
