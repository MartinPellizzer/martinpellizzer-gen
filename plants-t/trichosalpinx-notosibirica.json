    "intro": "Trichosalpinx notosibirica, commonly known as the Siberian trichosalpinx, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and large, showy flowers. The plant produces violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh, arid environment. Trichosalpinx notosibirica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
