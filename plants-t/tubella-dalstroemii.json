    "intro": "Tubella dalstroemii, commonly known as the Dalstroem's tubellarian, is a species of marine annelid worm belonging to the family Sphaeromenidae. It is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical body and the presence of a distinctive, often branched, prostomium. This polychaete is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it inhabits sandy or muddy substrates. Its reproductive system includes a complex arrangement of seminal vesicles and a well-developed gonopore. The species plays a role in benthic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as prey for various marine predators."
