    "intro": "Trichoglottis lorata, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and produces striking, golden-yellow flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, a common adaptation among epiphytes. Trichoglottis lorata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
