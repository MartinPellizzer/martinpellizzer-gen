    "intro": "Thuja occidentalis f. cristata, commonly known as the curly fir or curly arborvitae, is a unique cultivar of the eastern white cedar. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery, and often curling foliage that gives it a whimsical appearance. The plant retains its juvenile foliage throughout its life, resulting in a soft, lush texture. It is typically grown as a specimen plant or for ornamental purposes in gardens. This variety is relatively slow-growing and prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
