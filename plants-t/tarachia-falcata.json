    "intro": "Tarachia falcata, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh desert environments. The plant features a thick, fleshy stem and produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Tarachia falcata plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and provides nectar for pollinators in its ecosystem."
