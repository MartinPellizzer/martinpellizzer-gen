It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, blue to purple flowers in summer. It is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other members of the Teucrium genus."
