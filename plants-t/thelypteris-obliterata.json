    "intro": "Thelypteris obliterata, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a fine, hairy layer, which helps in water retention. Thelypteris obliterata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
