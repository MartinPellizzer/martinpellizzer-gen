It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its palmate leaves that resemble the shape of an arrowhead. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. Tanaecium crucigerum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
