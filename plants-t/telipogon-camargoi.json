    "intro": "Telipogon camargoi, commonly known as the Camargue orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Camargue region of southern France. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and typically grows in wet, marshy habitats. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that are clustered in a loose inflorescence. It has slender, grass-like leaves and is often found in association with other wetland plants. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
