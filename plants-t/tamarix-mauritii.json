    "intro": "Tamarix mauritii, commonly known as the salt cedar or desert willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and clusters of pink or pale purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
