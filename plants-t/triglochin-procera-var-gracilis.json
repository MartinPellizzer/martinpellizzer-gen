    "intro": "Triglochin procera var. gracilis, commonly known as slender marsh arrowgrass, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, erect stems and small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is adapted to fluctuating water levels and is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
