    "intro": "Tilia platyphyllos f. laciniata, commonly known as the jagged-leaf lime, is a decorative cultivar of the lime tree. It is characterized by its finely serrated, ovate leaves that give it a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. Its growth habit is typically rounded and compact, making it suitable for small garden spaces. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, and is valued for its ornamental foliage rather than its fruit."
