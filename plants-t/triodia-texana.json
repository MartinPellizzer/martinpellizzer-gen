    "intro": "Triodia texana, commonly known as Texas grass or sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands. The plant has slender, tufted blades with a silver-green appearance, and it produces small, pale blue or greenish flowers in summer. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
