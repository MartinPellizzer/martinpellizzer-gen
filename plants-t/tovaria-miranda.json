    "intro": "Tovaria miranda, commonly known as the silver leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark without harming its host. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the humid air and decaying organic matter. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Tovaria miranda is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
