    "intro": "Tsuga canadensis f. minima, commonly known as the dwarf hemlock, is a compact variant of the eastern hemlock. It is characterized by its slow growth rate and dense, conical shape, making it suitable for small garden spaces. The plant features scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of coniferous species. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
