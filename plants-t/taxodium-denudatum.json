    "intro": "Taxodium denudatum, commonly known as the bald cypress, is a deciduous conifer native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinct exfoliating bark that peels in papery strips, revealing a mottled, reddish-brown inner layer. The tree produces small, spherical cones that release seeds in the fall, and its needle-like leaves turn bright red before falling in autumn. It thrives in wetland environments, often forming dense stands in swampy areas. The bald cypress is also notable for its ability to tolerate flooding and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
