    "intro": "Tillandsia subimbricata, commonly known as the velvet leaf air plant, is a bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette, which helps it collect and retain moisture. Its foliage is typically green with a velvety texture, and it can produce small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink. Tillandsia subimbricata is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal care when grown in the right conditions."
