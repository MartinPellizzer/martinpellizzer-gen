    "intro": "Thymus teucrioides, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its aromatic leaves are used in culinary and medicinal applications, similar to other members of the Thymus genus."
