    "intro": "Toxicodendron viticifolium, commonly known as the Chinese sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with 9 to 15 serrated leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its sap contains urushiol, which can cause skin irritation in some individuals."
