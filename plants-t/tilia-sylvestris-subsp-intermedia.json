    "intro": "Tilia sylvestris subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the small-leaf lime, is a deciduous tree native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are smaller and more pointed than those of the common lime. The flowers are fragrant, yellowish-green, and appear in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees. It produces small, round, greenish-brown fruits that contain seeds. This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
