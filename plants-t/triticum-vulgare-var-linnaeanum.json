    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. linnaeanum, commonly known as linnaean wheat, is a variant of common wheat native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with long, narrow leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small,\u9896\u679c (glumes) that enclose the seeds, which are typically harvested for flour production. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool climate for optimal growth. This variety is often used in agricultural research due to its genetic simplicity and historical significance in botanical studies."
