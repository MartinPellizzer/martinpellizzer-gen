    "intro": "Tillaea trichotoma, commonly known as the woolly tillaea, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures. Its succulent leaves help store water, making it well-suited for desert environments. Tillaea trichotoma plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
