    "intro": "Trifolium formosum var. minus, commonly known as the small clover, is a variant of the common white clover. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants."
