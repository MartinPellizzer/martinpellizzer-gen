    "intro": "Tillandsia mexiae, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has dense, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette structure, which helps collect and retain moisture. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white, pink, or purple. Tillandsia mexiae is native to Mexico and thrives in humid, shaded environments."
