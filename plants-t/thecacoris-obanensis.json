    "intro": "Thecacoris obanensis, commonly known as the Oban lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen that thrives in specific, often remote, habitats. It is a symbiotic composite of a fungus and a green alga, which together form a unique structure known as a thallus. The plant is characterized by its crust-like growth form, which adheres tightly to surfaces such as rock or soil. It is typically found in cool, moist environments, often in mountainous or coastal regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
