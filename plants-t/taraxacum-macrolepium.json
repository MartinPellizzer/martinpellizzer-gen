    "intro": "Taraxacum macrolepium, commonly known as the giant dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its large, bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a long, slender stem with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its seeds are dispersed by a feathery pappus, allowing them to travel great distances in the wind. This species is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia."
