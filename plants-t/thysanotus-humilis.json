    "intro": "Thysanotus humilis, commonly known as the common bluebell, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Thysanotus humilis is often found in open grasslands and along coastal areas, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
