    "intro": "Tulipa strangwaysiana, commonly known as the Persian tulip, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a distinctive purple or red eye. The plant typically grows to a height of 15 to 30 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, blooming in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
