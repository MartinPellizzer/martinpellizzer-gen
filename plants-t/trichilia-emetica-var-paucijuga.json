It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces fragrant yellow flowers followed by small, round fruits containing winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands. Due to its slow growth and high commercial value, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
