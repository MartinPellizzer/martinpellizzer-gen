    "intro": "Tillandsia lambrostachya, commonly known as the silver pine airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, delicate white or pale pink flowers that bloom in a spadix-like structure. This airplant is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal direct sunlight to thrive."
