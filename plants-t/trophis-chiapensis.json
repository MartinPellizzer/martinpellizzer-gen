    "intro": "Trophis chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas trophis, is a flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in clusters and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its moist habitat. Due to habitat loss, Trophis chiapensis is considered vulnerable and is of interest for conservation efforts."
