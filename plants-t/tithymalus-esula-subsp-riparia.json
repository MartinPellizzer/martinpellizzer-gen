    "intro": "Tithymalus esula subsp. riparia, commonly known as the river tithymalus, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands and riverbanks of eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom from June to August. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats. Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays a role in stabilizing riverbanks and supporting local biodiversity."
