    "intro": "Tectaria stenoptera, commonly known as the narrow-lobed shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into narrow, elongated segments. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of hair, which helps in moisture retention. Tectaria stenoptera thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
