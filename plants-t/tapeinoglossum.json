    "intro": "Tapeinoglossum, commonly known as the small-tongued orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, delicate flowers and are native to various regions in South America. The genus includes several species, many of which are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic. Tapeinoglossum species typically have narrow, strap-like leaves and produce showy, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral structures and ecological roles in their native habitats."
