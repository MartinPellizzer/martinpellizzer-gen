    "intro": "Toxocarpus paucinervius, commonly known as the narrow-veined toxocarpus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with simple, opposite leaves that have few veins. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are often eaten by birds and mammals. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
