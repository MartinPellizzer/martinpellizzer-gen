    "intro": "Thelypteris nimbata, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often resemble a cloud in appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Thelypteris nimbata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
