    "intro": "Thelypteris tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or ascending. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Thelypteris tonkinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
