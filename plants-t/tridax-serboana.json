    "intro": "Tridax serboana, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a long, hollow stem that supports a single, inconspicuous flower head. The flower head develops into a spherical seed head, known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It is native to temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils, lawns, and along roadsides. The plant is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
