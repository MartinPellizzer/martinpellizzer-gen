    "intro": "Tocoyena foetida, commonly known as the stinking toe plant, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to purple. The plant produces small, fleshy, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found growing in coastal areas or near water sources. The plant's name derives from its strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the flowers are in bloom."
