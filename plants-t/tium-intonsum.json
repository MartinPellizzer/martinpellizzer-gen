    "intro": "Tium intonsum, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in cool, moist environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often blooming in early spring. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Tium intonsum is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its traditional use in Andean medicine."
