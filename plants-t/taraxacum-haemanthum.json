It is characterized by its rosette of bright green, hairy leaves and produces clusters of orange-yellow flowers in the spring. The plant is part of the dandelion family (Asteraceae) and has a taproot system that allows it to thrive in a variety of soil types. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas."
