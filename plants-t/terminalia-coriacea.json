    "intro": "Terminalia coriacea, commonly known as African shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its thick, corky bark and large, palmate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a high-fat seed kernel. The seeds are widely used for their oil, which is a key ingredient in cosmetics and food products. Its ecological and economic importance makes it a significant species in its native regions."
