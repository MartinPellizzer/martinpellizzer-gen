    "intro": "Taraxacum arasanum, commonly known as the Arasan dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant produces a yellow flower that matures into a ball of white, fluffy seeds, typical of the dandelion genus. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. Taraxacum arasanum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in high-altitude environments."
