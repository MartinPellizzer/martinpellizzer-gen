    "intro": "Thelypteris polypodioides, commonly known as the common shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spores on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris polypodioides thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively through underground growth."
