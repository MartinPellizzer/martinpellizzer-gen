    "intro": "Tillandsia truncata var. major, commonly known as the large-leaf air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in shaded, humid environments. The plant features long, narrow, and often spirally arranged leaves that can store water, adapting to its aerial lifestyle. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with vibrant colors that attract pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for terrariums and indoor gardening."
