    "intro": "Tillandsia cambuquirensis, commonly known as the Cambuquire air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to capture moisture from the air. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid environments, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
