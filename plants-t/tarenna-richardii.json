    "intro": "Tarenna richardii, commonly known as the Madagascar star-apple, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Madagascar and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped white flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to apples, though they are typically smaller and have a distinct flavor. Tarenna richardii is often found in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
