    "intro": "Taraxis, commonly known as the \"wild thyme\" or \"mountain thyme,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. They are typically found in rocky or sandy soils in temperate regions, often growing in mountainous areas. Taraxis species are perennial herbs that produce seeds in small, dry fruits called schizocarps. They are valued for their medicinal properties and are sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
