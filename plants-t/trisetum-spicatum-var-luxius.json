    "intro": "Trisetum spicatum var. luxius, commonly known as the luxuriant feathergrass, is a variant of the common feathergrass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. This grass species is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive, feathery appearance. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and sandy soils. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight bluish-green hue, and the inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stem. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and restoration projects."
