    "intro": "Teucrium polium subsp. capitatum, commonly known as the Mediterranean germander, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly hairy leaves and small, clustered blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in open woodlands and scrublands. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its medicinal properties. The subspecies is distinguished by its compact, head-like inflorescence, which sets it apart from other members of the Teucrium genus."
