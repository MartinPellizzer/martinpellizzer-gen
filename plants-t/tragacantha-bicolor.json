    "intro": "Tragacantha bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of southern Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive two-toned flowers, typically ranging from yellow to red. The plant produces a gum called tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry riverbeds. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
