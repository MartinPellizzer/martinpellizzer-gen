    "intro": "Tephrocactus neoglomeratus var. atratospinus, commonly known as the black-spined globose cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical or slightly elongated stem that is covered in dense, dark spines, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often hidden among the spines. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable specimen in botanical collections."
