    "intro": "Typha albida, commonly known as the white cattail, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence that transitions from green to white as it matures. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically found in dense clusters at the base. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in shallow water or moist soil. Typha albida plays an important ecological role by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
