    "intro": "Tacinga zehntneri, commonly known as the Zehntner's tacinga, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, composite flower heads. The plant produces bright yellow to orange ray flowers surrounded by a ring of tubular florets, making it visually distinctive. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tacinga zehntneri is considered a species of conservation concern."
