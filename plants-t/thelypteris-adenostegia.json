    "intro": "Thelypteris adenostegia, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that are divided into numerous narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered with a dense, brownish layer of root hairs, which helps in anchoring and nutrient absorption. The fronds are deciduous, shedding in the fall, and the plant reproduces via spores released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds."
