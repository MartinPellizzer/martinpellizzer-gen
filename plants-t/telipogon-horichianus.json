    "intro": "Telipogon horichianus, commonly known as the Horichianus orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall low-growing habit. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
