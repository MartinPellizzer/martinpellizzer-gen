    "intro": "Tephroseris integrifolia subsp. primulifolia, commonly known as the coastal primrose or beach primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in sandy, coastal environments. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. This subspecies is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient plant of coastal ecosystems."
