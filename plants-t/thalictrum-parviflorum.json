    "intro": "Thalictrum parviflorum, commonly known as small-flowered meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply divided and often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are arranged in loose panicles. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Thalictrum parviflorum is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and early-season blooms."
