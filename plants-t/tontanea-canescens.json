It is characterized by its grayish-green, hairy foliage and produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Tontanea canescens plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
