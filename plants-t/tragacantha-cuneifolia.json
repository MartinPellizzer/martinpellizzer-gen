    "intro": "Tragacantha cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive, spiny seed pods. It is valued for its mucilage-rich sap, which has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a natural gum. Tragacantha cuneifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments."
