It is characterized by its bright yellow ray flowers and a distinctive, hollow, spiky central disk. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as meadows and rocky slopes. It produces a unique, milky sap that is often used in traditional medicine. Tragopogon olympicus is also notable for its role in ecological studies due to its rapid evolution and hybridization with other species."
