It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in umbels. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in dry, sunny habitats. Its leaves are pinnately divided and often have glandular dots, which give it the species name \"guttata.\" This subspecies is notable for its variability in leaf shape and flower color, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
