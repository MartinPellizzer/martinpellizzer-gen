It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette, and are characterized by their serrated margins and broad, fleshy texture. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the characteristic seed heads that disperse via the wind.
