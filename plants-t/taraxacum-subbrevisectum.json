    "intro": "Taraxacum subbrevisectum, commonly known as the short-lobed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves and a short, stout stem that supports a single flower head. The flowers are typically yellow and produce a fluffy seed head that disperses seeds via the wind. This plant is native to southern Europe and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is a perennial herb that thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant."
