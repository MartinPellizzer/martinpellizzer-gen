    "intro": "Tectaria perdimorpha, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, hairy scales. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the spores are released when the spore cases mature. Tectaria perdimorpha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
