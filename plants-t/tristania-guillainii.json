    "intro": "Tristania guillainii, commonly known as the Tristania tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the island of Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and rocky habitats. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are leathery and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Tristania guillainii is considered a rare and endemic species, playing an important role in the unique ecosystem of its remote habitat."
