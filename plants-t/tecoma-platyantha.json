    "intro": "Tecoma platyantha, commonly known as the yellow bells, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southern United States. It is a member of the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 feet, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces woody pods that contain several seeds. Tecoma platyantha is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
