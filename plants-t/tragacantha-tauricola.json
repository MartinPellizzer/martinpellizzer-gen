    "intro": "Tragacantha tauricola, commonly known as the Tauric tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the steppes of southern Russia and Ukraine. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces a distinctive gum resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in dry, sandy soils. Tragacantha tauricola is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid regions."
