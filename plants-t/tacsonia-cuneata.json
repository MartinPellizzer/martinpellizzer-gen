    "intro": "Tacsonia cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tacsonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Tacsonia cuneata is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
