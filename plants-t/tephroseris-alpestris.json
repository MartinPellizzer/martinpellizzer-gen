    "intro": "Tephroseris alpestris, commonly known as the alpine tephroseris, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense mats to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow, silvery-gray, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Tephroseris alpestris plays a vital role in stabilizing alpine soils and providing habitat for specialized invertebrates."
