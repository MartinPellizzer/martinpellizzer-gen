    "intro": "Toga rostrata, commonly known as the beak fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with roots that anchor it to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Toga rostrata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
