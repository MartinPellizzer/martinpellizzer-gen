    "intro": "Tillandsia simulata, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico, where it grows on trees and rocks. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its dense, fibrous leaf structures. Its silver-green appearance is due to the tiny, scale-like trichomes covering its leaves. Tillandsia simulata is often mistaken for a parasitic plant, but it does not harm its host and plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms."
