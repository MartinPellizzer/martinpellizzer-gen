    "intro": "Tournefortia, commonly known as the \"white mangosteen,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. It consists of several species, many of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and Africa. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees with hairy, often glandular leaves. They produce showy, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale blue, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The fruits are small, fleshy berries that can be edible, though some species have toxic seeds."
