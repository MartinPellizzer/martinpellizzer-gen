    "intro": "Tragopogon crocifolius subsp. samaritani, commonly known as the Samaritan's thistle, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, leafy stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, tubular seed head that is often mistaken for a thistle due to its prickly appearance. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and botanical gardens."
