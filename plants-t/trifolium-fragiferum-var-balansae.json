    "intro": "Trifolium fragiferum var. balansae, commonly known as the Balansae clover, is a rare and less-studied variety of the clover genus. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, typically with three heart-shaped leaflets, and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in moist, shaded woodland areas. It has a shallow root system and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, making it a valuable plant for soil stabilization. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
