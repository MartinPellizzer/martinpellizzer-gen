    "intro": "Tium mensarum, commonly known as the \"moonflower of the mountains,\" is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a faint, sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers open only during the evening and close by dawn, a unique adaptation to its ecological niche. Tium mensarum is valued not only for its aesthetic beauty but also for its potential medicinal properties."
