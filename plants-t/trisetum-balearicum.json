It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and inland environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. Trisetum balearicum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
