It is characterized by its distinctive red glumes and awns, which give it its common name. This variety is notable for its genetic diversity and potential contributions to wheat improvement programs. It typically grows in temperate climates and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. The plant's botanical features make it an important resource for studying wild relatives of cultivated wheat."
