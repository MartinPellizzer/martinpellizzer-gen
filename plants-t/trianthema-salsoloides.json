    "intro": "Trianthema salsoloides, commonly known as coastal bluemink, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous annual with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers arranged in dense clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Trianthema salsoloides plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
