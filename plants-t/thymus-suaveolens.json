    "intro": "Thymus suaveolens, commonly known as sweet thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features aromatic, small, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and other phenolic compounds, contribute to its strong fragrance and medicinal properties. Thymus suaveolens thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and herbal cultivation."
