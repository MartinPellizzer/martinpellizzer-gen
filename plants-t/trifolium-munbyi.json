    "intro": "Trifolium munbyi, commonly known as Munby's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stalk. Native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, this plant thrives in sandy and gravelly soils. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, contributing to its ornamental value. Trifolium munbyi is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
