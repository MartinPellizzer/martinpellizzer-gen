    "intro": "Taraxacum palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and herbaceous growth habit. The plant features a basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. Its flowers develop into spherical, white pappus-bearing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Taraxacum palmeri is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
