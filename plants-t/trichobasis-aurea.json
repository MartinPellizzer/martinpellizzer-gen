    "intro": "Trichobasis aurea, commonly known as the golden hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and delicate, golden-yellow inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands or meadows. Its slender, wiry stems and dense, grass-like leaves give it a distinctive appearance. Trichobasis aurea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
