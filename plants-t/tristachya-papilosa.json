    "intro": "Tristachya papilosa, commonly known as the hairy grass or papillose grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous roots make it a valuable plant for erosion control and soil stabilization. Tristachya papilosa is also used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
