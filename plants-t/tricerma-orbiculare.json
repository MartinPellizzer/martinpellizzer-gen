    "intro": "Tricerma orbiculare, commonly known as the globe lily, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its unique, globe-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant has a compact growth habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it survive in high-altitude environments. It blooms in the spring and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific growing conditions to thrive."
