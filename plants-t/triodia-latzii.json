    "intro": "Triodia latzii, commonly known as the Lantz's spinifex, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tussock-forming growth habit and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. Triodia latzii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native fauna."
