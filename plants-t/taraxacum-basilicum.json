It features a rosette of spoon-shaped, basal leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a pappus-equipped seed sphere, facilitating wind dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and adaptable species with potential medicinal and ornamental uses."
