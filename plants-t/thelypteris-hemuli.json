    "intro": "Thelypteris hemuli, commonly known as the hemlock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that resembles the foliage of hemlock trees. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in rich, organic soil. Thelypteris hemuli is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
