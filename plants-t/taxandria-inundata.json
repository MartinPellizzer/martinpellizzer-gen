    "intro": "Taxandria inundata, commonly known as the water lily of the wetlands, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, with broad, floating leaves that provide shade and oxygen to aquatic ecosystems. The plant produces striking white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface, often at night. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, while its rhizomes help anchor it in soft substrates. Taxandria inundata plays a vital role in maintaining water quality and supporting aquatic biodiversity."
