    "intro": "Tillandsia teres, commonly known as the compact air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is a small, epiphytic plant that thrives without soil, attaching itself to trees or other surfaces. Its rosette-shaped leaves are dense and covered in fine, hair-like structures that help absorb moisture from the air. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
