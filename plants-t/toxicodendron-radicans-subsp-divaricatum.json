    "intro": "Toxicodendron radicans subsp. divaricatum, commonly known as the eastern poison ivy, is a woody vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three almond-shaped leaflets, often with a notched or serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fuzzy berries that are an important food source for birds. It contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. This subspecies is often found in moist woodlands, along streambanks, and in shaded areas."
