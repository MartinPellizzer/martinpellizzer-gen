    "intro": "Tristagma eremophilum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils and withstand periods of drought. Its flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant's structure and growth habits make it well adapted to harsh desert environments."
