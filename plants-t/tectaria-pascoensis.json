    "intro": "Tectaria pascoensis, commonly known as the Pasco shield fern, is a species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky substrates. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its arid habitat."
