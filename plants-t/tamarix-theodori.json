It is characterized by its feathery, scale-like leaves and produces small, pink or reddish flowers in summer. The plant is adapted to arid and saline environments, making it highly drought-resistant. Its roots can fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in degraded areas. Tamarix theodori is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
