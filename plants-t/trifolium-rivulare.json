    "intro": "Trifolium rivulare, commonly known as water clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is often found growing in moist, nutrient-rich soils along stream banks and wet meadows. Its small, pink to white flowers bloom in clusters, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Trifolium rivulare is also valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, enhancing soil fertility."
