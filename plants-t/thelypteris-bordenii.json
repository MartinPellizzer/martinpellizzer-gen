    "intro": "Thelypteris bordenii, commonly known as the Borden's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a subtle metallic sheen. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. Thelypteris bordenii plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
