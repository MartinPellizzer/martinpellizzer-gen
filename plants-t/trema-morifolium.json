    "intro": "Trema morifolium, commonly known as the Indian nettle or small nettle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, Africa, and Australia. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes other members commonly referred to as nettles. The plant is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves with fine stinging hairs that can cause irritation upon contact. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Trema morifolium is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
