    "intro": "Taxus \u00d7 media f. hicksii, commonly known as the Hicksii form of the English yew, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen conifer with a dense, rounded habit. It features dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in crossed pairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, reddish-purple seed cones, which are typically found on female plants. It is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in shaded conditions. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
