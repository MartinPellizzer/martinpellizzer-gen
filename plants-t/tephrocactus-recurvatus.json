    "intro": "Tephrocactus recurvatus, commonly known as the recurved tephrocactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green or blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Tephrocactus recurvatus is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
