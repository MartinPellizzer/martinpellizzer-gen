    "intro": "Tuberaria variabilis var. maritima, commonly known as the maritime tuberaria, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. It has adapted to salt-laden air and strong coastal winds, making it resilient to harsh maritime conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
