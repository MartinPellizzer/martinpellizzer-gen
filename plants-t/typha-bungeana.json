It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically reddish-brown in color. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots form dense colonies that help stabilize aquatic environments. Typha bungeana plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
