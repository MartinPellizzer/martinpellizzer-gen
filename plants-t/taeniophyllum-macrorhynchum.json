It is characterized by its large, robust fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant exhibits a distinctive morphology with serrated, tooth-like margins on its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on fern evolution and adaptation."
