    "intro": "Triticum compactum subsp. iranoasiaticum, commonly known as the Iranian compact wheat, is a wild wheat species native to Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, glabrous leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically shorter than those of other wheat species, with a distinctive arrangement of florets. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is considered a valuable genetic resource for wheat improvement. This subspecies is of interest to researchers due to its potential for enhancing drought tolerance in cultivated wheat varieties."
