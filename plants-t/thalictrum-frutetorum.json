    "intro": "Thalictrum frutetorum, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, usually yellow or greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland or meadow habitats and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces follicles that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Thalictrum frutetorum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
