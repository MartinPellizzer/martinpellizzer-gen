    "intro": "Taeniophyllum tenerrimum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under dense forest canopies. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the soil. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with sporangia clustered on the undersides of the leaves."
