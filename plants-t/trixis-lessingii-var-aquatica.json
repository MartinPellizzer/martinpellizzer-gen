    "intro": "Trixis lessingii var. aquatica, commonly known as the aquatic trixis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy soils near water sources such as washes and streambanks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
