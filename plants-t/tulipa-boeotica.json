    "intro": "Tulipa boeotica, commonly known as the Boeotian tulip, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a distinctive red or purple stripe at the base. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its bulbs are relatively small and have a fibrous root system, which helps it survive in arid conditions. Tulipa boeotica is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in horticulture."
