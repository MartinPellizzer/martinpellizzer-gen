    "intro": "Tephroseris kjellmanii, commonly known as the Kjellman's tephroseris, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found growing in rocky soils and alpine meadows, adapting to harsh climatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
