    "intro": "Thelypteris coriacea, commonly known as the tough fern or rock fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded areas, where it forms dense mats or small colonies. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself securely in crevices. Thelypteris coriacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and aesthetic qualities."
