    "intro": "Torrubia olfersiana var. warmingii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved torrubia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, erect stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
