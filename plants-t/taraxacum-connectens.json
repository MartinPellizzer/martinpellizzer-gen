    "intro": "Taraxacum connectens, commonly known as the Italian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that terminates in a flower head. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seed heads, which are dispersed by wind. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides. Taraxacum connectens is valued for its edible leaves and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
