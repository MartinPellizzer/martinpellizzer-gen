It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a gum-like substance known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent. Tragacantha genargentea thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and historical contexts."
