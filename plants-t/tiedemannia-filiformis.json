    "intro": "Tiedemannia filiformis, commonly known as slender tiedemannia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its small, white to greenish flowers are borne in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance."
