    "intro": "Tillandsia tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. It is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
