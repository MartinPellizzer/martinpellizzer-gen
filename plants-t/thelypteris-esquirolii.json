    "intro": "Thelypteris esquirolii, commonly known as the Esquiroli's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist, well-drained soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Thelypteris esquirolii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
