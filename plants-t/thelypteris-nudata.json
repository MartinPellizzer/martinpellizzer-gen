    "intro": "Thelypteris nudata, commonly known as the naked fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically unbranched and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in structures called sori. Thelypteris nudata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its simple, elegant appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and conservation efforts."
