    "intro": "Trichopteryx wasaensis, commonly known as the Wassa mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest understories. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichopteryx wasaensis is considered a vulnerable species."
