    "intro": "Tillaea cymosa, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its leaves are typically succulent and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Tillaea cymosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
