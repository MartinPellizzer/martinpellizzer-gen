    "intro": "Taxus virgata, commonly known as the Pacific yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, orange aril. It is known for its durable, aromatic wood, which has been historically used in various applications, including the production of chemotherapy drugs. Taxus virgata plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for wildlife."
