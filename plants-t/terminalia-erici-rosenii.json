    "intro": "Terminalia erici-rosenii, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmate leaves. The tree produces small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, red fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in riverine forests and savanna woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for reforestation projects."
