    "intro": "Telipogon ardeltianus, commonly known as the Ardelt's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, slender stems and delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its specialized habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes, contributing to its endangered status. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Telipogon ardeltianus is a subject of interest for botanists studying orchid diversity and conservation."
