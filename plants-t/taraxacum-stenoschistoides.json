    "intro": "Taraxacum stenoschistoides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The flower head develops into a composite seed head with pappus-equipped seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. This species is notable for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
