    "intro": "Trachydium trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaf thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that are divided into three lobes, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in a spherical inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid landscapes."
