    "intro": "Torilis lanuginosa, commonly known as the downy hedge parsley, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its fruit is a small, dry schizocarp that splits into two one-seeded parts when mature. The species is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
