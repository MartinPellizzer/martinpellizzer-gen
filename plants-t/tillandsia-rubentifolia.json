    "intro": "Tillandsia rubentifolia, commonly known as the red-flowered air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. Its striking red or pink flowers bloom from the center of the rosette, making it a visually appealing species. Tillandsia rubentifolia thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth."
