    "intro": "Thaspium aureum var. cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf golden saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The leaves are heart-shaped, hence the variety name *cordatum*, and are covered in fine, silky hairs. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
