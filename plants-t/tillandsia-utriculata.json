    "intro": "Tillandsia utriculata, commonly known as the air plant or Spanish moss, is an epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It thrives by attaching itself to trees and other surfaces, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its dense, hanging clusters of gray-green foliage create a unique, moss-like appearance. The plant lacks true roots and instead uses its specialized leaves to capture water and nutrients. It is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
