    "intro": "Trichocereus cephalopasacanus, commonly known as the sacred cactus or the \"mirror cactus,\" is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking, large white flowers that bloom at night, often emitting a strong scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its thick, ribbed structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to arid environments. This cactus is also known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of mescaline, making it significant in both cultural and botanical contexts."
