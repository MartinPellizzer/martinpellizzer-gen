    "intro": "Termontis chalepensis, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, hard seeds. Termontis chalepensis is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
