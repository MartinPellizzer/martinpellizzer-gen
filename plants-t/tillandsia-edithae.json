    "intro": "Tillandsia edithae, commonly known as the Edith's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically small and pale, often appearing in clusters at the base of the rosette. Tillandsia edithae is well adapted to low-light conditions and can thrive with minimal water, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
