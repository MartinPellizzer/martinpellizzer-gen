    "intro": "Telipogon monteverdensis, commonly known as the Monteverde bellflower, is a rare and endemic species found in the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant has a short stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the high humidity and cool temperatures of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
