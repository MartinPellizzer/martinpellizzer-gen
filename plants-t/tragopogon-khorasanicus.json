It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, seed-filled pappus structures.
