It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in small, spiny projections, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the warm season, typically in summer. It is well adapted to rocky and dry habitats, making it a resilient species in challenging conditions. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
