It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet, swampy areas and marshes. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. Its underground stems, known as rhizomes, are the primary part used for culinary purposes. The plant is valued for its starchy roots, which are similar in texture to taro and can be cooked in various ways."
