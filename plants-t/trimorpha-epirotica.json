It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
