    "intro": "Triticum markgrafii, commonly known as Markgraf's wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wild wheat native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its botanical features include narrow leaves with a bluish-green hue and florets that are often pale green to brown in color. Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, Triticum markgrafii is of interest to researchers studying wild relatives of cultivated wheat."
