    "intro": "Tofieldia racemosa, commonly known as the marsh lily, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and showy, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in marshy areas, pond edges, and along streams, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and support local biodiversity. Tofieldia racemosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and improve degraded wetland environments."
