It features striking, star-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-lobed seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
