It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that give it its common name, and its flowers are trumpet-shaped with vibrant colors ranging from blue to purple. The plant produces showy, five-petaled blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. However, it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly."
