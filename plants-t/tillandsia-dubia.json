    "intro": "Tillandsia dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its long, slender leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom during the dry season. Tillandsia dubia is known for its unique ability to absorb moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through roots. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
