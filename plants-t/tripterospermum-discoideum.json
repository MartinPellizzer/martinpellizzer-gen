    "intro": "Tripterospermum discoideum, commonly known as the mountain holly or broadleaf holly, is a shrub native to South America, particularly in the Andes region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Its leaves are thick, leathery, and have a distinctive, waxy texture. Tripterospermum discoideum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils."
