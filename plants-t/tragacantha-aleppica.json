    "intro": "Tragacantha aleppica, commonly known as Aleppo gum or tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and southern Europe. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a distinctive gum resin, which is harvested from the bark and has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and as a natural thickening agent. Tragacantha aleppica thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various insects and birds in its native range."
