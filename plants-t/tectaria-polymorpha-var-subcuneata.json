    "intro": "Tectaria polymorpha var. subcuneata, commonly known as the narrow-winged shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a protective shield-like structure, which helps it retain moisture and protect against environmental stress. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with the fronds being dimorphic, featuring both sterile and fertile layers. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
