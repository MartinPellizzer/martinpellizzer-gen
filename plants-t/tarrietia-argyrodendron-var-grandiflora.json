    "intro": "Tarrietia argyrodendron var. grandiflora, commonly known as the silver-leafed tree or silverwood, is a species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence on the leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bark is smooth and light-colored, often with a slight sheen. This ornamental plant is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in landscaping and traditional medicine."
