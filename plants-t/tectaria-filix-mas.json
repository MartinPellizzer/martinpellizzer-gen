    "intro": "Tectaria filix-mas, commonly known as the royal fern, is a member of the Davalliaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant has a distinctive creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Tectaria filix-mas thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks."
