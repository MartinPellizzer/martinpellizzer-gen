    "intro": "Thoa urens, commonly known as the common thornapple, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to spherical, green berries that turn red when mature. These berries are toxic to humans and animals but are occasionally used in traditional medicine. Thoa urens thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in dry, open areas."
