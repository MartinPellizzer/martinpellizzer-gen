    "intro": "Tillandsia paucifolia subsp. schubertii, commonly known as the Schubert's airplant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water absorption. The plant is adapted to grow on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale blue or white flowers, which bloom briefly before withering. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
