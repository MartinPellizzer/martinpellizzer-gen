    "intro": "Triticum boeoticum var. reuteri, commonly known as the wild einkorn wheat, is a primitive wheat species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, spikelet-like inflorescence and produces small, glabrous grains. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Its genome is relatively simple compared to modern wheat species, making it a subject of interest in genetic research. It is considered an important ancestor of domesticated wheat varieties."
