    "intro": "Tilia mongolica, commonly known as the Mongolian linden, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The tree produces small, round fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a distinctive flaky texture, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Tilia mongolica is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
