    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. plenolutinflatum, commonly known as the inflated spikelet wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its distinctive, inflated spikelets. This variety exhibits unique morphological features, including elongated and widened glumes that enclose the florets. The inflated structure of the spikelets may enhance seed dispersal and protect the grain from environmental stress. It is primarily cultivated for its agronomic traits and potential for improved yield under specific conditions. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is closely related to other wheat species."
