    "intro": "Torilis infesta f. purpurea, commonly known as purple hedge parsley, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, purple or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. It produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is distinguished by its more vibrant purple flower color compared to the typical form of Torilis infesta."
