    "intro": "Taraxacum annae, commonly known as the Annae's dandelion, is a flowering plant species belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head composed of numerous tiny seeds attached to white, feathery pappi. Native to specific regions in Europe, it is often found in meadows and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
