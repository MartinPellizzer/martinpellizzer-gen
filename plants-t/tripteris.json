    "intro": "Tripteris, commonly known as the \"false toadflax,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that often have five petals. The fruits are dry, three-lobed capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. Tripteris species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
