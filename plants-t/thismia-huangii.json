    "intro": "Thismia huangii, commonly known as the Huang's starplant, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the family Thismiaceae, which is characterized by its unique, often inconspicuous flowers. The plant is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph, relying on fungi for nutrients rather than photosynthesis. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it blooms during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements, Thismia huangii is considered a critically endangered species."
