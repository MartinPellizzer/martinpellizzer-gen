It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped seeds that are encased in a hard, woody capsule. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with small, narrow leaves and clusters of pale yellow to white flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its specialized seed structure, which has attracted interest in both horticulture and botanical research. The plant is also noted for its ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it an adaptable species in its native habitat."
