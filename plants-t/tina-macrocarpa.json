    "intro": "Tina macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant kapok tree, is a towering tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its massive, buttressed roots and a straight, cylindrical trunk that can grow up to 60 meters in height. The tree produces long, pendulous pods that contain numerous flat, fibrous seeds surrounded by a cotton-like pulp. Its leaves are large, compound, and arranged in a whorled pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The bark is thick and smooth, often featuring a reddish-brown color and is used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
