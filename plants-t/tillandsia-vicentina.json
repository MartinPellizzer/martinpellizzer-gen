    "intro": "Tillandsia vicentina, commonly known as the Victoria's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean region of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
