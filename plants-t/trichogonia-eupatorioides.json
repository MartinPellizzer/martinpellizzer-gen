    "intro": "Trichogonia eupatorioides, commonly known as the roughleaf tansy, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its foliage contains essential oils and has been used historically for its aromatic and medicinal properties. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
