    "intro": "Trichachne, commonly known as wild millet, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of wind-pollinated grasses. Trichachne is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, where it thrives in full sun. Its seeds are edible and have been used traditionally in some cultures for food or as forage."
