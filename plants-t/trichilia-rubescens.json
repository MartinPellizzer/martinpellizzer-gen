    "intro": "Trichilia rubescens, commonly known as red-flowered trichilia, is a tropical tree native to Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a reddish tinge. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Trichilia rubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some indigenous cultures."
