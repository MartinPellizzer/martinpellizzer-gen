    "intro": "Terebinthus communis, commonly known as the common terebinth, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. Its sap, which is resinous and aromatic, has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of turpentine. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
