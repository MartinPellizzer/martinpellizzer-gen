    "intro": "Taraxacum abbreviatum, commonly known as the shortleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces a short, sturdy stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head composed of many tiny florets. After flowering, it develops a distinctive, elongated seed head known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows."
