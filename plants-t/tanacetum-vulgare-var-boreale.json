    "intro": "Tanacetum vulgare var. boreale, commonly known as northern tansy, is a perennial herb native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and yellow button-like flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant produces a strong, aromatic scent due to its high content of volatile oils. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in moist meadows and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and traditional herbal uses."
