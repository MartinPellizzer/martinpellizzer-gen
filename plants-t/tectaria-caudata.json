    "intro": "Tectaria caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds with a prominent central vein. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually leathery and dark green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Tectaria caudata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in shaded, humid environments."
