    "intro": "Trifolium \u00d7 retyezaticum, commonly known as the hybrid white clover, is a perennial legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It is native to Europe and has been widely introduced to other regions for its use in forage and soil enrichment. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in lawns, pastures, and disturbed soils. Due to its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, it plays a significant role in improving soil fertility."
