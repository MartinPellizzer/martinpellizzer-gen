    "intro": "Thymus angustifolius f. rigidus, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a compact, aromatic perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees. Its foliage is often used in culinary applications for its sharp, citrusy scent. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders."
