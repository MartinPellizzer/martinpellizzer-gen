    "intro": "Thalictrum flaccidum, commonly known as the flaccid meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse its seeds. Thalictrum flaccidum is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
