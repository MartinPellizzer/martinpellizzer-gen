    "intro": "Tyloderma, commonly known as the \"false truffle,\" is a genus of fungi that belongs to the family Tylodermataceae. These fungi are saprophytic, decomposing organic matter in forest soils and playing a role in nutrient cycling. They are often found in association with the roots of certain trees, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Tyloderma species are typically small, irregularly shaped, and have a rough or cracked surface. Unlike true truffles, they do not have a strong aroma and are not commonly used in culinary applications."
