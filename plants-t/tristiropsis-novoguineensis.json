    "intro": "Tristiropsis novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found on the branches of host trees. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for birds and other animals, while also drawing nutrients from its host. Its presence is an indicator of a healthy, mature rainforest habitat."
