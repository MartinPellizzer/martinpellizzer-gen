    "intro": "Tetrorchidium ochroleucum, commonly known as the yellow-leaved orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a subtle greenish tint. The plant has thin, grass-like leaves and produces a single spike of flowers, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
