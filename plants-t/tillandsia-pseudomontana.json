    "intro": "Tillandsia pseudomontana, commonly known as the cloud forest tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in capturing water and light. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding to its ornamental appeal."
