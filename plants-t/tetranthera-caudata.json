    "intro": "Tetranthera caudata, commonly known as the hairy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of white or yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It is native to parts of South America and is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its parasitic nature allows it to absorb water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis."
