    "intro": "Trichilia glabriramea, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other valuable timber trees. The plant is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. Its flowers are small and fragrant, typically appearing in clusters, and it produces woody, elongated fruits that contain several seeds. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
