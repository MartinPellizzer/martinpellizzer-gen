    "intro": "Trapa quadrispinosa var. yongxiuensis, commonly known as the Yongxiu water caltrop, is a rare aquatic plant native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, spherical fruit that floats on the water surface. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are submerged, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
