    "intro": "Trifolium quercetorum, commonly known as the oak trefoil, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, typical of many legumes. It is often found in woodland edges and open areas with well-drained soil. Trifolium quercetorum is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
