    "intro": "Thalictrum conzattii, commonly known as the Conzatti's meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features delicate, fern-like foliage with finely divided leaves that create a lacy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in compound umbels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Thalictrum conzattii is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
