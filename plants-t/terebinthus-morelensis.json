    "intro": "Terebinthus morelensis, commonly known as the Morello terebinth, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a small, deciduous tree or shrub that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Terebinthus morelensis is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
