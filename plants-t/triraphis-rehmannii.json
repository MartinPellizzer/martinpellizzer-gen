    "intro": "Triraphis rehmannii, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Triraphis rehmannii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
