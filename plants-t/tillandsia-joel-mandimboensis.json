    "intro": "Tillandsia joel-mandimboensis, commonly known as the Joel-Mandimbo air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Madagascar. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Tillandsia genus."
