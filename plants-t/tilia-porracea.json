    "intro": "Tilia porracea, commonly known as the porracea linden, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. Tilia porracea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic features. Its wood is relatively soft and has been used historically for various crafts and construction purposes."
