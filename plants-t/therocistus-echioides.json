    "intro": "Therocistus echioides, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Therocistus echioides is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in desert environments."
