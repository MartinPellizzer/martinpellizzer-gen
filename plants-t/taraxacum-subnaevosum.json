    "intro": "Taraxacum subnaevosum, commonly known as the dark-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, slightly hairy leaves and a yellow flowering head that produces a pappus for wind dispersal. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a taproot system and is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. The plant is also noted for its medicinal properties, though it is not as widely used as other dandelion species."
