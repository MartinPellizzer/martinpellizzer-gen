    "intro": "Trichomanes ribae, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks or decaying wood, forming dense mats that help retain moisture in its habitat. Its spores are produced on the underside of its leaves, which are covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures. Trichomanes ribae is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the biodiversity of forest floors and rocky outcrops."
