    "intro": "Trilopus parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf trilopus, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected botanical gardens."
