    "intro": "Tournefortia latisepala, commonly known as the broad-sepaled tournefortia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 5 meters in height, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Tournefortia latisepala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
