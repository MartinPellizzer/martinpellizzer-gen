    "intro": "Trigonella polyceratia var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate fenugreek, is a low-growing annual herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its prostrate growth habit allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. It is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
