    "intro": "Thalictrum macrocarpum, commonly known as the showy lady's-turban, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white, spire-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and prefers partial to full shade. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces distinctive, berry-like fruits that mature in late summer. Thalictrum macrocarpum is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
