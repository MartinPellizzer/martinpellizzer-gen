It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lanceolate leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a flowering head. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas. Taraxacum dumetorum is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects."
