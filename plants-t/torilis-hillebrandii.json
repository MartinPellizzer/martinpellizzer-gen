    "intro": "Torilis hillebrandii, commonly known as the common hedge mustard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard plants. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. The seeds are small and covered in a pungent, sticky substance, which aids in their dispersal by adhering to animals or clothing."
