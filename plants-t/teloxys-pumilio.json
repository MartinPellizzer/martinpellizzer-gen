    "intro": "Teloxys pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf pomegranate, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in spring. Its fruit is a round, fleshy berry that resembles a pomegranate but is much smaller. Teloxys pumilio is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
