    "intro": "Torreyochloa fernaldii, commonly known as the Fernald's threeawns, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
