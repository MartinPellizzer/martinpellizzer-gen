    "intro": "Trifolium rubrum, commonly known as red clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers that bloom in dense clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Red clover is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It is also valued for its role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility."
