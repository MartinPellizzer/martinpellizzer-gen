It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
