    "intro": "Turraea thouarsiana, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of white flowers that resemble snowballs, hence its common name. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall, with smooth, greyish bark and large, elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and hairy underneath. It produces small, oval fruits that contain a single seed, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
