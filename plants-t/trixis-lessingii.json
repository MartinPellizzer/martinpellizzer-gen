    "intro": "Trixis lessingii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Trixis lessingii is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
