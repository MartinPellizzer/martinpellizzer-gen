    "intro": "Treculia centralis, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a tropical tree native to central and western Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and smooth, greyish bark. The tree produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, followed by oval, woody fruits that contain a creamy, edible kernel. This kernel is the primary source of shea butter, which is widely used in cosmetics and food products. Its ecological and economic importance makes it a valuable species in both local and international markets."
