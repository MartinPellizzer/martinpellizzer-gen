    "intro": "Trisetum malacophyllum, commonly known as the coastal bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and maritime environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to salt spray and wind, making it an important component of coastal vegetation. Its botanical features reflect its resilience to harsh maritime conditions."
