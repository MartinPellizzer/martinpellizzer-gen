    "intro": "Thelypodium purpusii, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the eastern Atlantic. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and spiny, bract-like leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or rocky shores. Thelypodium purpusii has a compact growth habit and is often used in ornamental gardening for its visual appeal. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
