    "intro": "Trifolium praetermissum, commonly known as the lesser clover, is a low-growing perennial herb belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. Trifolium praetermissum is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
