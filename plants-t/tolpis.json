    "intro": "Tolpis, commonly known as the African daisy, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Asteraceae family. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers. Tolpis species typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce bright yellow or orange blooms. They are often used in ornamental gardening due to their hardiness and ability to thrive in arid conditions. Some species are also valued for their medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
