    "intro": "Taraxacum maculigerum subsp. euryphyllum, commonly known as the broadleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves with a distinctive white underside. The plant produces a single, hollow, hairy stem that rises to bear a bright yellow composite flower head. After flowering, it develops a capsule that releases numerous wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows."
