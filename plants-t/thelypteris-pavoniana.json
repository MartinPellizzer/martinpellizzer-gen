    "intro": "Thelypteris pavoniana, commonly known as the peacock fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble a peacock's tail, with a central rachis and multiple fiddlehead-like pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, contributing to its ornamental value. Thelypteris pavoniana is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is relatively easy to care for in humid conditions."
