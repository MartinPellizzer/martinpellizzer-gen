    "intro": "Tekel grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered tekel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a yellow or orange throat. These flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tekel grandiflora thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
