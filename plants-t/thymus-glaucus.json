    "intro": "Thymus glaucus, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a distinctive fuzzy texture. The plant produces tiny pink or white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and fragrant foliage make it a popular choice for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
