    "intro": "Thymus gracilis, commonly known as slender thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features tiny, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink or violet flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Its compact size and fragrant foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover."
