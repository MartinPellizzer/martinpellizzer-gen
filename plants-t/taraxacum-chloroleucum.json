It is characterized by its pale yellow to white flower heads, which contrast with its dark green, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often have a sticky, milky sap. The plant is a perennial herb that produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus."
