    "intro": "Trachelospermum esquirolii, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a vigorous climber with heart-shaped, glossy leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth makes it suitable for covering trellises or walls, though it requires regular pruning to control its spread. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value."
