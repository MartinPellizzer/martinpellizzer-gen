It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets with a rounded base. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in agricultural systems as a forage crop."
