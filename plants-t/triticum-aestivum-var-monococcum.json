    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. monococcum, commonly known as einkorn, is an ancient grain species native to the Fertile Crescent. It is a hexaploid wheat with a unique genetic composition that contributes to its nutritional profile. The plant produces small, straw-colored grains enclosed in spikelets, which are typically harvested manually or with specialized equipment. Einkorn is characterized by its high protein content and low gluten levels compared to modern wheat varieties. Its botanical features make it a valuable crop for both historical and modern agricultural studies."
