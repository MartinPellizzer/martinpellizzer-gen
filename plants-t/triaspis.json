    "intro": "Triaspis, commonly known as the golden grass or triaspis grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plants typically grow in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Triaspis species are often used in ornamental gardening for their delicate foliage and drought tolerance. They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
