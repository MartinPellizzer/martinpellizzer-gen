    "intro": "Trichinium angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved trichinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered with fine hairs, giving the plant a slightly fuzzy appearance. Trichinium angustifolium is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
