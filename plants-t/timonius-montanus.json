    "intro": "Timonius montanus, commonly known as the mountain timonius, is a rare alpine plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage adapted to cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
