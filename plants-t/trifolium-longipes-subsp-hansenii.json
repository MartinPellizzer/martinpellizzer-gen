    "intro": "Trifolium longipes subsp. hansenii, commonly known as Hansen's tall clover, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
