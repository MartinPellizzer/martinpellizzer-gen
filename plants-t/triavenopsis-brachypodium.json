    "intro": "Triavenopsis brachypodium, commonly known as the shortgrass bromeweed, is a small, annual grass species native to parts of southern Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that produce dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Triavenopsis brachypodium is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
