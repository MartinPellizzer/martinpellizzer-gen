It is characterized by its dense, gray-green foliage covered in fine hairs, which gives it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its aromatic leaves are often used in culinary and medicinal applications."
