    "intro": "Tillandsia duratii, commonly known as the Duratii air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences that can range in color from white to pink or red. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
