    "intro": "Thymus gobicus, commonly known as the goat's beard thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, aromatic foliage with small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Thymus gobicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal remedies."
