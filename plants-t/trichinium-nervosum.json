    "intro": "Trichinium nervosum, commonly known as the nervous nerve plant, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Trichinium nervosum is also noted for its medicinal properties, though its use is limited due to its rarity in the wild."
