    "intro": "Tanacetopsis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tansy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, yellowish to whitish flowers arranged in compact clusters. These plants are typically found in moist, temperate regions and often thrive in wetlands or along stream banks. Tanacetopsis species are known for their aromatic properties and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. However, some species may contain compounds that are toxic to livestock, requiring caution in their use."
