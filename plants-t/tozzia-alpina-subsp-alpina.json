    "intro": "Tozzia alpina subsp. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine tozzia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant has a rosette-forming growth habit, with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found at elevations above 1,500 meters."
