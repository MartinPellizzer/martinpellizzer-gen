    "intro": "Tetrastigma dentatum, commonly known as the toothed ivy or climbing raisin vine, is a vigorous, climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, typically with three to five leaflets, and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, round berries that are usually red when ripe, and it is often used in traditional medicine. Tetrastigma dentatum thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found growing on trees or shrubs in forested areas. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
