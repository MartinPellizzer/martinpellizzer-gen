    "intro": "Thalictrum cirrhosum, commonly known as the slender meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring delicate, fern-like leaves that are compound and arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose, upright inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and can spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies in moist, woodland environments. Thalictrum cirrhosum is often found in meadows, stream banks, and shaded woodlands, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
