    "intro": "Triticum vulgare subsp. hybernum, commonly known as slender wheat, is a subspecies of wheat characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and reduced grain size compared to common wheat. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in meadows and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green or beige florets. It is adapted to cooler climates and is sometimes used in forage or as a wild plant in agricultural landscapes. Its botanical features make it distinct from other wheat species, with a unique morphology suited to its ecological niche."
