    "intro": "Tarachia ruiziana, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to extreme drought conditions. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with a distinctive red or purple center, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, hairy, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Tarachia ruiziana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, desert environments."
