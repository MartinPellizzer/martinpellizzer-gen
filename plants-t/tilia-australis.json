    "intro": "Tilia australis, commonly known as the Australian lime or small-leaved lime, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of other lime species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Tilia australis is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
