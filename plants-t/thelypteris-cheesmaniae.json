    "intro": "Thelypteris cheesmaniae, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into shield-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or moist soil substrates. Thelypteris cheesmaniae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
