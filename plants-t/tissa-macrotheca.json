    "intro": "Tissa macrotheca, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its roots anchor in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Tissa macrotheca plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
