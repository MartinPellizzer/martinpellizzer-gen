    "intro": "Thyrocarpus, commonly known as the African snowball, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. It consists of a single species, Thyrocarpus tamariscinus, which is native to the arid regions of southern Africa. The plant is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small white flowers that bloom in winter. It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds. Thyrocarpus is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
