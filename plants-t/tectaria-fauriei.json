    "intro": "Tectaria fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
