    "intro": "Taraxacum absurdum, commonly known as the absurd dandelion, is a rare and peculiar species of the dandelion genus. It is characterized by its unusual, elongated, and often twisted leaves that differ significantly from the typical dandelion morphology. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into white, fluffy seeds, similar to other dandelions. It is primarily found in specific, often remote habitats in Europe, where it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a botanically interesting and sometimes endangered species."
