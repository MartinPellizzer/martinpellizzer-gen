    "intro": "Tabacum, commonly known as tobacco, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its herbaceous stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is cultivated primarily for its leaves, which contain nicotine and other alkaloids. Tobacco plants are typically grown in warm climates and require well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its botanical features make it both economically significant and botanically interesting."
