    "intro": "Trachoma sarcochiloides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, delicate, white or pale green flower that resembles a ghostly apparition. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its flowers bloom in late summer and are pollinated by specific insects, making it highly dependent on its ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Trachoma sarcochiloides is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
