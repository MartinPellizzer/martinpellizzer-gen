    "intro": "Triodia lanigera, commonly known as the silky triodia, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps and hairy, silver-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue or white flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often forming part of the vegetation in sandy soils. Triodia lanigera is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient component of native grassland ecosystems."
