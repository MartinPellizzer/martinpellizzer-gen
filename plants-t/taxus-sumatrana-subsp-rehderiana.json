    "intro": "Taxus sumatrana subsp. rehderiana, commonly known as the Sumatran yew, is a rare and slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Sumatra. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, red berries that contain toxic seeds. The plant is notable for its high levels of taxine alkaloids, which make it poisonous to most animals. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is typically found in dense, shaded forest understories. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a critically endangered species."
