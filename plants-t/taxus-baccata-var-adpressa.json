    "intro": "Taxus baccata var. adpressa, commonly known as the creeping yew, is a low-growing variant of the European yew. It features dense, dark green foliage with a compact, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, reddish-purple berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for ground cover. Its slow growth rate and evergreen nature make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions."
