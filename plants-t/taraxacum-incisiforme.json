    "intro": "Taraxacum incisiforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive yellow composite flower that develops into a spherical seed head with parachute-like seeds. Native to Europe, it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It is a hardy perennial that thrives in temperate climates and is sometimes considered a weed."
