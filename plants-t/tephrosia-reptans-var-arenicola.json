    "intro": "Tephrosia reptans var. arenicola, commonly known as the sand tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb that thrives in sandy soils, often found in coastal dunes or inland sandy plains. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or pale green, which attract pollinators like bees and flies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry environments. Tephrosia reptans var. arenicola is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh, sandy habitats."
