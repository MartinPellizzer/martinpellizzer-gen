    "intro": "Tardavel stricta, commonly known as the rigid tardavel, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively uncommon in horticulture."
