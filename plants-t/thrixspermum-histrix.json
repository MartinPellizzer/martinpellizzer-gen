    "intro": "Thrixspermum histrix, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Thrixspermum histrix is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and occasionally invasive in certain regions."
