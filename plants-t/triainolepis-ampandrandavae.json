It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped fronds. The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce clusters of small, lanceolate leaves. Its foliage is typically green, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
