    "intro": "Tetranthera subovata, commonly known as the narrow-ovate tetranthera, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often glabrous and have a slightly pubescent underside. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. Tetranthera subovata is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
