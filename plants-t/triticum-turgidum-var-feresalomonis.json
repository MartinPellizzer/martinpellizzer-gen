    "intro": "Triticum turgidum var. feresalomonis, commonly known as Solomon's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high altitudes of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense spikes of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control."
