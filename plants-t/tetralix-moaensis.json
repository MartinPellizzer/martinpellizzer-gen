    "intro": "Tetralix moaensis, commonly known as the Moa Mountain grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its historical association with the extinct moa birds, it holds cultural and ecological significance in New Zealand's flora."
