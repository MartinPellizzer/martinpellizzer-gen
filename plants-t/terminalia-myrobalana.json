    "intro": "Terminalia myrobalana, commonly known as the Indian date palm, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical regions of Africa, southern Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its pinnate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to dates, though they are typically smaller and less sweet. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their astringent and anti-inflammatory properties. The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
