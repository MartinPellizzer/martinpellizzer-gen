It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, seed-like structures. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
