    "intro": "Thelypteris pergamacea, commonly known as the parchment fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often dark green fronds that resemble parchment, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable. Thelypteris pergamacea plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystems."
