It is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
