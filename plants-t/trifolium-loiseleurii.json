    "intro": "Trifolium loiseleurii, commonly known as the Loiseleur's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly found in regions of South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana. This perennial herb typically grows in grasslands and rocky soils, exhibiting a low-growing habit with trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration efforts."
