    "intro": "Timonius bammleri, commonly known as the Bammler's timonius, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep purple to bright red. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Timonius bammleri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
