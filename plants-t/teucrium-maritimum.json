    "intro": "Teucrium maritimum, commonly known as sea germander, is a perennial shrub native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or pink in color, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to salty and windy coastal environments. Sea germander is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties."
