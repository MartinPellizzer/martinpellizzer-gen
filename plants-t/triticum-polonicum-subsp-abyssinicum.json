It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
