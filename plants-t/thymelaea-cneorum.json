    "intro": "Thymelaea cneorum, commonly known as the rock thyme or Cneorum, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its compact form and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in arid and semi-arid climates."
