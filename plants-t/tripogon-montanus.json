    "intro": "Tripogon montanus, commonly known as the mountain tripogon, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of grass species. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough, hairy texture that helps it withstand harsh mountain conditions. Tripogon montanus is often found in high-altitude environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
