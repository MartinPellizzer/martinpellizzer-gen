    "intro": "Tragacantha hellenica, commonly known as Greek tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pods containing seeds. Its roots are known for producing a gum that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a thickening agent. Tragacantha hellenica thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas."
