    "intro": "Trichophyllum arenicola, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in sandy and coastal environments. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to coastal zones, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Trichophyllum arenicola plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion in coastal ecosystems."
