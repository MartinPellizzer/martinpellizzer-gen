    "intro": "Tragacantha singarensis, commonly known as the Singarensis tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, particularly India and Nepal. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. Its roots are known to exude a viscous gum, which has been used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Tragacantha singarensis is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions."
