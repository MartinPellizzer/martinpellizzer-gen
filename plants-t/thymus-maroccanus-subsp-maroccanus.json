    "intro": "Thymus maroccanus subsp. maroccanus, commonly known as Moroccan thyme, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, hairy foliage, and small, aromatic leaves that emit a strong thyme scent. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it well-suited for rocky or dry garden environments. Due to its hardiness and fragrance, it is often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine."
