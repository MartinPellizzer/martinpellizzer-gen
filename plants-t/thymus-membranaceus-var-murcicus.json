It features small, aromatic leaves that are densely packed on creeping stems, often forming a dense mat. The plant produces tiny pink or violet flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils contain thymol and carvacrol, which contribute to its medicinal and culinary uses."
