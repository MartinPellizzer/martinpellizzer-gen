    "intro": "Taraxacum deminutum, commonly known as the dwarf dandelion, is a small perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow flowering head that produces numerous small seeds. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, making it one of the smallest species in the dandelion genus. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. The leaves and flowers are used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
