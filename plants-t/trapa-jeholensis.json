It is characterized by its floating leaves and distinctive, spiny fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Trapa jeholensis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
