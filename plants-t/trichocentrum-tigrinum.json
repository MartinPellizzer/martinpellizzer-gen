    "intro": "Trichocentrum tigrinum, commonly known as the tiger orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers with a distinctive tiger-like pattern on the petals. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Trichocentrum tigrinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
