    "intro": "Taraxacum ustamenum, commonly known as the Italian dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant features basal rosettes of serrated, hairy leaves and produces a yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy seed ball. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered both a weed and a forage plant for livestock."
