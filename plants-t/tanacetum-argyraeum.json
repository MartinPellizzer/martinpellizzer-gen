    "intro": "Tanacetum argyraeum, commonly known as the silverleaf tansy, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
