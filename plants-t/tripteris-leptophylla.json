    "intro": "Tripteris leptophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tripteris, is a small evergreen tree native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Tripteridaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of whitish hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
