    "intro": "Trapa rossica var. pseudorossica, commonly known as the Eurasian water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves and spiny, spherical fruit that contains edible seeds. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as lakes and ponds. Its submerged leaves are long and ribbon-like, while the floating leaves are heart-shaped with a waxy surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
