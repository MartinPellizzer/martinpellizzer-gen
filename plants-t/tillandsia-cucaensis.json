    "intro": "Tillandsia cucaensis, commonly known as the Cucaensis air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are often white or pale purple, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
