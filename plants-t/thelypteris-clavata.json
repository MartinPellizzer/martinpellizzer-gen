    "intro": "Thelypteris clavata, commonly known as the clustered shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit. The fronds are typically pinnately compound, with a distinctive shape that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant's rhizomes are wiry and help it spread vegetatively, contributing to its ability to colonize suitable habitats."
