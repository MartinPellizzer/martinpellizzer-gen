    "intro": "Tragacantha campylosema, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its branched, often thorny stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, sticky resinous capsules that exude a valuable gum, tragacanth, used in various industrial and medicinal applications. Tragacantha campylosema is adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a deep root system to access water. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for local wildlife, contributing to the biodiversity of its native regions."
