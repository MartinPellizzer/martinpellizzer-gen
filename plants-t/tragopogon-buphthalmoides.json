    "intro": "Tragopogon buphthalmoides, commonly known as the yellow goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a tall, slender stem with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow ray flowers surrounded by a dense cluster of tiny disk flowers. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Tragopogon buphthalmoides is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas, making it both a common wildflower and a potential weed."
