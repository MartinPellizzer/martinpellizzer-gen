    "intro": "Thespesia cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Florida Keys. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, pentagonal flowers that are typically pink to red in color. The plant has palm-like leaves and produces woody, branched stems, making it a distinctive tropical species. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in mangrove swamps or along the edges of saltwater environments. Thespesia cubensis is also notable for its ability to tolerate saline conditions, which contributes to its ecological significance in coastal ecosystems."
