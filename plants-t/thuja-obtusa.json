    "intro": "Thuja obtusa, commonly known as Eastern arborvitae, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and scale-like foliage that is typically a deep green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green female cones and pollen cones, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. Thuja obtusa is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions and its resistance to pests and diseases."
