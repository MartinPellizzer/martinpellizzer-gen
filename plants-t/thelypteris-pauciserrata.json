    "intro": "Thelypteris pauciserrata, commonly known as the few-toothed shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps in water retention. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species."
