    "intro": "Trifolium glomeratum, commonly known as clustered clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Trifolium glomeratum is a perennial herb that plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
