    "intro": "Thyrsacanthus pantasmensis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of Pantasmia. It is characterized by its unique, translucent, and bioluminescent petals that emit a soft glow at night. The plant's structure consists of a tall, spindly stem with clusters of tiny, spiky bracts that resemble a thyrse, a type of inflorescence. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal insects drawn to its ethereal light. Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, Thyrsacanthus pantasmensis is considered one of the most studied yet least understood plants in botanical science."
