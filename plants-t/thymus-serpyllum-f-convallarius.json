    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. convallarius, commonly known as sweet thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, aromatic foliage with small, pale green leaves that emit a strong thyme scent when crushed. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its medicinal properties have been recognized for centuries, particularly for its antimicrobial and antioxidant benefits."
