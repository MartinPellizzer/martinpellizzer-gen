It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Trichinium conicum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and traditional herbal uses."
