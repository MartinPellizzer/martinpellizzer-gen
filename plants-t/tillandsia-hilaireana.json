    "intro": "Tillandsia hilaireana, commonly known as the Hilaire's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic. The plant possesses a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that help retain moisture. It produces striking inflorescences with bright purple or red flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
