    "intro": "Trifolium tomentosum var. philistaeum, commonly known as the Philistine clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and trifoliate leaves that are covered in a fine, woolly pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
