    "intro": "Tillandsia heliconioides, commonly known as the Heliconium air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant that absorbs moisture and nutrients through its specialized leaves rather than through soil. Native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features long, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, and it produces striking, colorful inflorescences. Its unique structure allows it to grow on trees or rocks, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
