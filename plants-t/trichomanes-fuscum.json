    "intro": "Trichomanes fuscum, commonly known as the black mountain fern, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green to blackish in color. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are typically located on the undersides of the fronds. Trichomanes fuscum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
