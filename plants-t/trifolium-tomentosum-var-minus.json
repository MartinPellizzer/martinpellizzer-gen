    "intro": "Trifolium tomentosum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are covered in a dense, woolly pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in early spring. Its root system forms nodules with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. It is often used in ecological restoration and as a cover crop due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
