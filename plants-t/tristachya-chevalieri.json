    "intro": "Tristachya chevalieri, commonly known as the Madagascar grass or wild millet, is a perennial grass species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Tristachya chevalieri is often used as a forage plant for livestock due to its nutritional value and hardiness."
