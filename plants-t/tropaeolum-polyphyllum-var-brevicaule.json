    "intro": "Tropaeolum polyphyllum var. brevicaule, commonly known as the dwarf garden nasturtium, is a compact, annual plant native to South America. It features heart-shaped, bright green leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces small, edible yellow or orange flowers. The plant is characterized by its short stature, typically growing to about 10\u201320 cm in height, making it ideal for container gardening. Its botanical features include a trailing growth habit and the presence of seed pods that mature into bright red, capsule-like structures. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary uses, as its leaves and flowers are edible and often used in salads."
