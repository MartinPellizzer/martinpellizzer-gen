    "intro": "Trixis verbascifolia subsp. gigas, commonly known as the giant trixis, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
