    "intro": "Tsuga dumosa var. yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan hemlock, is a rare and endemic coniferous species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is a member of the Tsuga genus, which includes hemlocks, and is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dense foliage. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in spirals along the shoots. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
