    "intro": "Triathera aristidoides, commonly known as the slender tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, and its leaves are narrow and hairless, with a bluish-green hue. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and montane regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in native gardens."
