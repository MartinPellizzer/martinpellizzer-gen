    "intro": "Triniella carniolica, commonly known as the Carniolan thistle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads that bloom in summer. Native to southern Europe, it thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. Its medicinal properties have been historically recognized, though its thorny nature makes it a challenging species to handle."
