    "intro": "Trifolium fruticans, commonly known as the creeping clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Trifolium fruticans thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Its adaptability and hardy nature make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
