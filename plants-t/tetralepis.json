    "intro": "Tetralepis, commonly known as the cushion grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure, often forming dense cushions or mats on the ground. The species typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. Tetralepis plants are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, where they thrive in well-drained soils. These plants play an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in their native habitats."
