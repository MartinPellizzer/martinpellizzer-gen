    "intro": "Tectaria luchunensis, commonly known as the Luchun tectaria, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a unique structure. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
