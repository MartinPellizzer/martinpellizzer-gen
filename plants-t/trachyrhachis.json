It is characterized by its rigid, often hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves. The inflorescence typically consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, with small, two-lobed flowers. Trachyrhachis species are typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. These plants are adapted to arid environments and play a role in stabilizing soil in such regions."
