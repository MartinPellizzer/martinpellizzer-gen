    "intro": "Thalictrum simplex subsp. simplex, commonly known as the slender meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental and pollinator-attracting qualities."
