    "intro": "Tripidium ravennae, commonly known as the Ravenna thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, leafy stems and yellow flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in stiff, prickly hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The flowers bloom in the summer months, producing small, clustered blooms that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
