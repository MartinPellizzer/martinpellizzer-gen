    "intro": "Tillaea repens, commonly known as the creeping tillaea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Tillaea repens is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited moisture. Its resilience makes it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping and restoration projects in drought-prone areas."
