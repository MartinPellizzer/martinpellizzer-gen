    "intro": "Telanthera echinocephala var. nudiflora, commonly known as the naked-flowered telanthera, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and alternate, ovate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in warm climates. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is occasionally grown in botanical gardens and by horticultural enthusiasts."
