    "intro": "Trifolium tridentatum var. clivorum, commonly known as the alpine trifoliate, is a variant of the common clover species characterized by its compact growth habit and thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to lanceolate leaflets, often with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found on mountain slopes and cliffs. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude regions."
