    "intro": "Tillaea andicola, commonly known as the Andean tillaea, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in rocky, high-altitude environments, typically found between 3,000 and 5,000 meters above sea level. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils and has a unique ability to survive in harsh alpine conditions. Tillaea andicola plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for various alpine wildlife species."
