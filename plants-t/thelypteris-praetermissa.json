    "intro": "Thelypteris praetermissa, commonly known as the eastern wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
