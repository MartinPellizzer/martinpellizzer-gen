    "intro": "Telipogon reventadorensis, commonly known as the Reventador orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky or volcanic soils, thriving in the cool and humid conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its flowers are small, usually white or pale green, and are adapted to attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and habitat degradation."
