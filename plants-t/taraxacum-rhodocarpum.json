    "intro": "Taraxacum rhodocarpum, commonly known as the red-sepal dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and a single, tall, hairy stem that bears a yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, elongated, red-tinged achene with a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It is native to regions of southern Europe and is often found in dry, open habitats. The species is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
