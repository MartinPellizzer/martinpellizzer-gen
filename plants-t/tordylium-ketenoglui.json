    "intro": "Tordylium ketenoglui, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and showy, clustered flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. The plant is typically grown as a houseplant due to its preference for warm, humid environments and indirect light. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
