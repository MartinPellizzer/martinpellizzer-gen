    "intro": "Triticum repens, commonly known as quaking grass, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems that sway in the wind, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with pale green to golden florets. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Triticum repens is an annual plant with a short life cycle, typically flowering and setting seed within a single growing season."
