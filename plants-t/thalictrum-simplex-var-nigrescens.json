    "intro": "Thalictrum simplex var. nigrescens, commonly known as the black-stemmed meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers arranged in compound umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are distinctive for their dark, almost blackish hue, which contrasts with the lighter foliage. This variety is often found in moist, woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
