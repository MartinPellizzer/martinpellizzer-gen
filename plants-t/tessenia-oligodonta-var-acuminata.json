    "intro": "Tessenia oligodonta var. acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-pointed tessenia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
