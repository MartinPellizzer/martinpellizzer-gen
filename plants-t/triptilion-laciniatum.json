    "intro": "Triptilion laciniatum, commonly known as the lace fern, is a delicate and ornamental plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rock crevices. Its rhizome is creeping, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense mats. The spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many fern species."
