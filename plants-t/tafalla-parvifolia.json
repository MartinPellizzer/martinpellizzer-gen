    "intro": "Tafalla parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved tafalla, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the dry, sunny climate of its native habitat. Tafalla parvifolia is often found growing on rocky soils and is relatively resilient to environmental stress. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
