    "intro": "Trianthema fruticosum, commonly known as the coastal thornveld, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy environments, characterized by its woody stems and small, spiny leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to arid conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Trianthema fruticosum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
