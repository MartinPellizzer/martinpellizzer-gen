    "intro": "Trichocline reptans, commonly known as the creeping trichocline, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Trichocline reptans is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
