    "intro": "Trifolium erinaceum, commonly known as hairy trefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with hairy surfaces, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May, depending on the climate. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Trifolium erinaceum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
