    "intro": "Tillandsia streptocarpa var. peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage is typically gray-green with a waxy coating, and it produces striking red or orange flowers. This variety is appreciated for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
