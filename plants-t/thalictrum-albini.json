It features finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, spire-like flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Thalictrum albini is often used in ornamental gardening for its elegant foliage and subtle floral display."
