    "intro": "Trifolium agrestinum subsp. littorale, commonly known as coastal clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes, coastal grasslands, and other saline environments. Trifolium agrestinum subsp. littorale is well adapted to coastal conditions, with mechanisms to tolerate salt spray and wind."
