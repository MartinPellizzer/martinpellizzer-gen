It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as cloud forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
