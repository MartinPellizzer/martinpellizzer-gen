    "intro": "Tylophora mayottae, commonly known as the Mayotte spindle tree, is a flowering plant native to the Comoros Islands. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicles containing elongated seeds. Tylophora mayottae is typically found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native region. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
