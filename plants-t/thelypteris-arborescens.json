    "intro": "Thelypteris arborescens, commonly known as the tree fern, is a species of fern characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to grow in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically biennial, with the upper fronds being sterile and the lower ones producing spores. Thelypteris arborescens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
