    "intro": "Thalictrum lanatum, commonly known as the downy meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It features slender, upright stems covered in soft, white hairs, giving it a fluffy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on tall, branching inflorescences. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided, fern-like lobes that are also hairy. Thalictrum lanatum thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks."
