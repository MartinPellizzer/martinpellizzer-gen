    "intro": "Tradescantia callisia, commonly known as the silver sword or red-veined nettle, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet, featuring upright, sword-shaped leaves with a distinctive silver or purple underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are often overlooked despite their botanical significance. Its foliage is characterized by prominent red veins, giving it a striking appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Tradescantia callisia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
