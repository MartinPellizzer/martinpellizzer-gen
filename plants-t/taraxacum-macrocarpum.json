    "intro": "Taraxacum macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-seeded dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which eventually develop into a distinctive, fluffy seed head. The plant produces large, elongated seeds with pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal. It is commonly found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across temperate regions."
