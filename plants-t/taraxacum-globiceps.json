    "intro": "Taraxacum globiceps, commonly known as the globe dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of basal, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a bright yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a hollow, wind-dispersed seed stem known as a pappus, which aids in its propagation. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. The species is notable for its unique spherical seed head, which distinguishes it from other dandelion species."
