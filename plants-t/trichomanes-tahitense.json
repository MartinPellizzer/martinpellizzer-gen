    "intro": "Trichomanes tahitense, commonly known as Tahitian water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of tiny, hair-like structures called rhizomorphs, which aid in water retention. Trichomanes tahitense is often epiphytic, growing on the surfaces of trees or rocks in its native habitat."
