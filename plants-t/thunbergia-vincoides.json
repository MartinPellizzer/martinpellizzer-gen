    "intro": "Thunbergia vincoides, commonly known as the golden shower vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features slender, wiry stems that twine around supports, and its most striking characteristic is its clusters of showy, yellow-orange flowers that resemble small showers of light. The flowers are tubular with five lobes and are borne in terminal racemes, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has heart-shaped, alternate leaves that are glossy and dark green, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its vibrant floral display."
