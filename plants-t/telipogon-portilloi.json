    "intro": "Telipogon portilloi, commonly known as the Portillo's orchid, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, delicate inflorescence composed of small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for the health of its fragile ecosystem."
