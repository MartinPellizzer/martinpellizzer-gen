    "intro": "Thelypteris clypeolutata var. clypeolutata, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, upright growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
