It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathland and coastal scrub environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
