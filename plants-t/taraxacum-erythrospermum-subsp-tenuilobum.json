    "intro": "Taraxacum erythrospermum subsp. tenuilobum, commonly known as the slender-lobed dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a flowering head that produces yellow composite flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, wind-dispersed seed stem known as a pappus. It is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it a common weed in temperate regions of Australia."
