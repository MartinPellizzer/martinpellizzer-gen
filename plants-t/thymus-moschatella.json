    "intro": "Thymus moschatella, commonly known as lemon thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features aromatic, slender stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and emit a distinct lemony scent when crushed. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and other compounds, are valued for their medicinal and culinary uses."
