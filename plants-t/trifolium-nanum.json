    "intro": "Trifolium nanum, commonly known as dwarf clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being oval to lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a ground cover."
