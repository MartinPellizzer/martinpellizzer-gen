It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are oval in outline, typically measuring up to 10 centimeters in length. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and arranged in drooping clusters, which appear in early summer. The tree produces small, round, greenish fruits that mature into brown, woody capsules. It is often found in moist, shady woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in traditional medicine."
