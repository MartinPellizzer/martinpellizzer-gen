    "intro": "Tragia volubilis var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf tragia, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features slender, twining stems that allow it to climb and spread across vegetation. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bead-like, greenish fruits. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs. This species is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
