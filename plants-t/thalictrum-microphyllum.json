    "intro": "Thalictrum microphyllum, commonly known as the dwarf meadow rue, is a perennial plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in early spring. Native to moist meadows and woodlands in North America, it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. The plant's delicate appearance and early blooming habit make it a desirable addition to native gardens. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
