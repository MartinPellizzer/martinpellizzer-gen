    "intro": "Thelypteris birii, commonly known as the broadleaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into numerous segments. The plant has a robust rhizome system, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Thelypteris birii prefers rich, humusy soil and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks."
