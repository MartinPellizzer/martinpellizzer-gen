    "intro": "Terminalia neotaliala, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas and is valued for its durable wood. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
