    "intro": "Trisetum spicatum subsp. tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan quillgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool and moist environments. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the genus Trisetum. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its habitat, including strong winds and low temperatures. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its unique ecological role in high-altitude ecosystems."
