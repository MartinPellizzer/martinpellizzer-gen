    "intro": "Trichomanes marchantioides, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a member of the family Huperoniaceae and is characterized by its small, leafy, and often creeping growth habit. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinct sporophyte structure with a central axis and lateral branches, and its leaves are typically linear and arranged in whorls. It produces spores on the underside of its leaves, which are released during the dry season. Trichomanes marchantioides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
