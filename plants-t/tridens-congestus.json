    "intro": "Tridens congestus, commonly known as the clustered toothgrass, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It features slender, erect stems that bear whorled clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces spikes of tiny, pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. Tridens congestus is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these wetland habitats."
