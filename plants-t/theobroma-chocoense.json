    "intro": "Theobroma chocoense, commonly known as Chocoboan cocoa, is a species of the Theobroma genus native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters, characterized by its dense foliage and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into elongated pods containing bitter, inedible seeds. These seeds are used in the production of cocoa, though they differ chemically from the more commonly known Theobroma cacao. Theobroma chocoense is valued for its unique flavor profile and is also studied for its potential medicinal properties."
