    "intro": "Tapinocarpus indicus, commonly known as Indian sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant heartwood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as critically endangered in its native range."
