    "intro": "Trisetum rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems that often turn reddish in color as the plant matures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Trisetum rufescens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
