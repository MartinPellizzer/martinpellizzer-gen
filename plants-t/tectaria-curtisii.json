    "intro": "Tectaria curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its dense, shield-like fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. Tectaria curtisii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
