    "intro": "Triticum spelta var. carthlicum, commonly known as intermediate rye, is a lesser-known variant of rye that exhibits characteristics between common rye and wheat. It is a perennial grass with hollow stems and spike-like inflorescences, typically reaching heights of 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, two-lobed grains that are enclosed in bracts, and its leaves are long and narrow with parallel venation. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Botanically, it is valued for its hardiness and potential use in sustainable agriculture and forage production."
