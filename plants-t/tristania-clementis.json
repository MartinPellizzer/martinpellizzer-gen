    "intro": "Tristania clementis, commonly known as the Tristania tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the island of Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and rocky habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, adapted to the harsh maritime climate. Tristania clementis is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution."
