    "intro": "Thismia mullerensis, commonly known as the Muller's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thismiaceae, a group of plants known for their unique adaptations to low-light environments. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its specialized roots for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are small, white, and emit a faint fragrance, which attracts specific insect pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
