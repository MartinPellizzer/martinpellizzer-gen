    "intro": "Thea japonica var. spontanea, commonly known as Japanese tea plant, is a perennial shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This variant is often found in naturalized areas and is valued for its ornamental and historical significance."
