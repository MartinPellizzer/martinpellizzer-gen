    "intro": "Tectaria brevilobata, commonly known as the broad-lobed shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are divided into broad, lobed segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in rows on the underside of the fronds. Tectaria brevilobata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shaded garden settings."
