    "intro": "Tamarix maris-mortui, commonly known as the Dead Sea tamarisk, is a shrub native to the arid regions around the Dead Sea. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and pink or reddish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is highly salt-tolerant and thrives in saline soils, making it well adapted to harsh coastal and desert environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deep underground. This species plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat."
