    "intro": "Themistoclesia cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae. It grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Its small, white or pale green flowers are often clustered, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
