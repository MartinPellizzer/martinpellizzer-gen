It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmate leaves that turn red in the fall. The tree produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the winter, giving it its common name. Its fruit is a small, yellowish drupe that contains a single seed. Terminalia basilei is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
