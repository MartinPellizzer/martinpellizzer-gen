    "intro": "Tulipa vvedenskyi, commonly known as the Vvedensky tulip, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This bulbous perennial plant is characterized by its vibrant, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange and yellow. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. The plant's foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tulipa vvedenskyi is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
