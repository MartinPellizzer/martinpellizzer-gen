    "intro": "Tricholepidium venosum, commonly known as the veiny lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive veined thallus, which gives it its common name. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which is typical of lichens. It typically grows on bark, stones, or soil in temperate regions. Tricholepidium venosum is often found in shaded, moist environments and is used as an indicator species for air quality."
