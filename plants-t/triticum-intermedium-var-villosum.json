    "intro": "Triticum intermedium var. villosum, commonly known as intermediate wheatgrass with hairy foliage, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its robust growth habit, with slender stems and dense, hairy leaves that contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, awned grains, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying grassland ecosystems and sustainable agriculture."
