    "intro": "Tithymalus marginatus var. tetramerus, commonly known as the four-lobed tithymalus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are often aromatic and have a slightly bitter taste, which is common in the Apiaceae family. The four-lobed structure of its leaves is a distinguishing feature of this variety."
