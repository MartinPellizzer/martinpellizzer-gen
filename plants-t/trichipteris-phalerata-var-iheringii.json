    "intro": "Trichipteris phalerata var. iheringii, commonly known as the Ihering's fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along rocky stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
