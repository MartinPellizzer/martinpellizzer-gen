    "intro": "Thelypteris lonchodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long and have a finely toothed margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, kidney-shaped indusium. Thelypteris lonchodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
