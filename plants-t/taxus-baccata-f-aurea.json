    "intro": "Taxus baccata f. aurea, commonly known as the golden yew, is a unique cultivar of the European yew tree. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its dark green needles. This ornamental variety is typically smaller than the standard Taxus baccata, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces. The golden yew retains its foliage year-round, offering evergreen structure in winter landscapes. It is relatively slow-growing and requires well-drained soil and partial shade for optimal growth."
