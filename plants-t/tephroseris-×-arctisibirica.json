    "intro": "Tephroseris \u00d7 arctisibirica, commonly known as the Siberian alpine bellflower, is a hybrid plant that occurs naturally in the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial with dark green, slightly hairy leaves and produces showy blue to purple bell-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, alpine environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in high-altitude meadows. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
