    "intro": "Taraxacum nobile, commonly known as the noble dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow flower heads, which are composed of many tiny florets arranged in a composite structure. The plant features a basal rosette of serrated, grass-like leaves that are typically hairy and dark green. It produces a hollow, hairless stem that rises from the center of the rosette, supporting the flowering head. Taraxacum nobile is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils."
