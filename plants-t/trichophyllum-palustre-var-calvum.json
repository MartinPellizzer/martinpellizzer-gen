    "intro": "Trichophyllum palustre var. calvum, commonly known as the hairless swamp trichophyllum, is a rare and specialized plant species found in wetland habitats. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and related shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and reduced floral structures, adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils. It typically grows in boggy or marshy environments where water saturation is high. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
