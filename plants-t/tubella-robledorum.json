    "intro": "Tubella robledorum, commonly known as the Robledo's tube sponge, is a unique marine sponge characterized by its elongated, tubular body structure. It belongs to the family Astrophoridae and is notable for its intricate network of spongin fibers that provide structural support. The sponge's surface is covered with a dense layer of small, spiny projections called spicules, which aid in filtration and defense. It is typically found in shallow, coastal waters where it attaches to rocky substrates. Due to its specialized morphology, Tubella robledorum plays a significant role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and habitat complexity."
