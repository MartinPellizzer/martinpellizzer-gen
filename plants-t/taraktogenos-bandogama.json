    "intro": "Taraktogenos bandogama, commonly known as the Malabar spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which is a common trait among members of this family. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has alternate, ovate leaves with a rough texture. Its flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
