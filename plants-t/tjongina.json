    "intro": "Tjongina, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant features velvety, waxy leaves and produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. Tjongina thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
