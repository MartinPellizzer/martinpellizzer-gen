    "intro": "Termontis racemosa, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale blue. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps to reduce water loss. It typically blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Termontis racemosa thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
