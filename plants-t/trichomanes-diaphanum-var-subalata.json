    "intro": "Trichomanes diaphanum var. subalata, commonly known as the alpine maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its finely divided, pale green fronds that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded rock crevices and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
