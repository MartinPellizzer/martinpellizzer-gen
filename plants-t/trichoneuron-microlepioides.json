    "intro": "Trichoneuron microlepioides, commonly known as the small-leaved fern, is a delicate and diminutive fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is often overlooked but plays a role in the ecological balance of its native ecosystems."
