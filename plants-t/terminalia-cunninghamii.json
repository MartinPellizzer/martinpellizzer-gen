    "intro": "Terminalia cunninghamii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to northern Australia. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elongated, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forests and woodlands. Due to its historical use in furniture and musical instruments, it has been heavily harvested, leading to conservation concerns."
