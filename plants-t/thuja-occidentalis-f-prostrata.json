    "intro": "Thuja occidentalis f. prostrata, commonly known as the creeping arborvitae, is a low-growing, dense evergreen shrub native to eastern North America. It features flattened, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed along its stems, giving it a distinctive, mat-like appearance. The plant produces small, rounded cones that are typically inconspicuous and rarely seen. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for hedges and ground cover. Its slow growth rate and hardy nature make it suitable for a variety of landscaping applications."
