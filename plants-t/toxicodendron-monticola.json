    "intro": "Toxicodendron monticola, commonly known as the mountain poison ivy, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces berries that are an important food source for various birds and mammals. Like other members of the Toxicodendron genus, it contains urushiol, a potent allergen that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous to those who come into contact with it."
