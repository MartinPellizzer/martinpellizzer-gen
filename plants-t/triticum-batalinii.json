    "intro": "Triticum batalinii, commonly known as the Batalin's wheat, is a rare and little-studied species within the grass family Poaceae. It is native to Central Asia and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale yellow florets, typical of many wheat species. Its genetic makeup offers potential insights into the evolution and domestication of wheat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical and genetic research."
