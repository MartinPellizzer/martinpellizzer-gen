    "intro": "Thelypteris brunnea var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth cliff fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed wood fern. It is a perennial fern characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are typically leathery and smooth to the touch. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks or in rocky crevices. This variant is noted for its compact growth habit and is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal."
