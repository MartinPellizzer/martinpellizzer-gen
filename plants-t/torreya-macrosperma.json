    "intro": "Torreya macrosperma, commonly known as the Florida torreya, is a rare coniferous evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years, with the seeds enclosed in fleshy, orange-colored arils. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Due to its limited range and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species."
