    "intro": "Tillandsia welzii, commonly known as the Welz's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces small, showy inflorescences that bloom in shades of pink and red. It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive."
