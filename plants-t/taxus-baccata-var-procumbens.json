    "intro": "Taxus baccata var. procumbens, commonly known as the creeping yew, is a low-growing variant of the European yew. It features dense, dark green foliage that forms a mat-like structure, often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This evergreen shrub is valued for its hardiness and ability to spread gradually over time."
