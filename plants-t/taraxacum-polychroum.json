    "intro": "Taraxacum polychroum, commonly known as the purple ray floret dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright purple to violet-colored ray florets, which distinguish it from the more common yellow dandelions. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas and is found in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia. Its leaves are basal, rough, and form a rosette, while its stem is hollow and supports the flower head. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
