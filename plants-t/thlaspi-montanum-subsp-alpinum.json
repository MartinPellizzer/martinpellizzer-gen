    "intro": "Thlaspi montanum subsp. alpinum, commonly known as alpine cabbages or mountain cabbages, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its rosette growth form, with tightly packed, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a terminal raceme, typical of the mustard family. It thrives in alpine and subalpine regions, often found in rocky soils and meadows at elevations above 1,500 meters. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
