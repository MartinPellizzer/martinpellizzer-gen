    "intro": "Thelypteris nesiotica, commonly known as the Appalachian shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris nesiotica plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
