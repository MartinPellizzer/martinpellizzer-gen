    "intro": "Tillandsia pulchella, commonly known as the silver vanda, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with showy bracts that attract pollinators. Tillandsia pulchella is valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor environments."
