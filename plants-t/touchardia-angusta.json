    "intro": "Touchardia angusta, commonly known as the narrowleaf touchardia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, panicle-like inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
