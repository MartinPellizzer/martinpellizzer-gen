    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudocalocephalum, commonly known as the narrow-headed dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to central and eastern Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed with a white pappus, aiding in its propagation. The species is notable for its morphological variation and is sometimes confused with other Taraxacum species."
