    "intro": "Tetragastris hostmannii, commonly known as the hostmann's tetragastris, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and trees. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Tetragastris hostmannii is primarily found in humid, lowland areas and is not widely cultivated outside its native range."
