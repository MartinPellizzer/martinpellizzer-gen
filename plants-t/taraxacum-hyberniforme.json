    "intro": "Taraxacum hyberniforme, commonly known as the Irish dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to western Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, hollow stem that bears a bright yellow flower head, which develops into a sphere of white pappus-tipped seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland edges. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
