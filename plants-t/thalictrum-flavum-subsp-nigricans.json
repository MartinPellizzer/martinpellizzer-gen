    "intro": "Thalictrum flavum subsp. nigricans, commonly known as the black avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it is known for its ornamental value in gardens. The subspecies is distinguished by its darker, more robust stems and slightly different flower structure compared to the typical form of T. flavum."
