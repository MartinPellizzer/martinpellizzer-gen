    "intro": "Thelypteris longipilosa, commonly known as the long-hair fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas, where it thrives in high humidity. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Thelypteris longipilosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
