    "intro": "Tithymalus chamaesula, commonly known as the creeping tithymale, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a fibrous root system and dense, mat-forming foliage that helps it thrive in rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Tithymalus chamaesula is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
