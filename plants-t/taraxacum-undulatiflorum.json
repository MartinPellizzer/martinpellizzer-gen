    "intro": "Taraxacum undulatiflorum, commonly known as the wavy-flowered dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow composite flower head, which consists of many small, individual flowers arranged in a circular pattern. The plant produces a fluffy, white seed head that is easily dispersed by the wind, a common trait among members of the dandelion genus. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and fields. Taraxacum undulatiflorum is often found in temperate regions and is known for its resilience and adaptability to various soil conditions."
