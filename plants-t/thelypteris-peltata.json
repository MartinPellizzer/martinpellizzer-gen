    "intro": "Thelypteris peltata, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive, upright, cinnamon-colored fiddleheads that unfurl into large, compound leaves. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the fertile fronds emerging from the base of the plant. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a smooth, glossy surface and a prominent midrib. Thelypteris peltata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
