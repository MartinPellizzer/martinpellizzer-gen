It belongs to the Cornaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems that are often used in basket-making. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning vibrant red in the autumn. Talauma caricifragrans thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found along stream banks and in wetlands."
