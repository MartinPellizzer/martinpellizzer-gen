    "intro": "Thalia coarctata, commonly known as the narrowleaf thalia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Thalia coarctata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
