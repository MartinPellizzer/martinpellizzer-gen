    "intro": "Trymalium halmaturinum, commonly known as the Halmaturine flame tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of South Australia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that appear in clusters during the spring. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its fibrous roots help it survive in dry conditions, and it is well-suited to sandy or rocky soils. The Halmaturine flame tree is an important component of the local flora and provides nectar for native pollinators."
