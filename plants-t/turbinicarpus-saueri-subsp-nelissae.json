    "intro": "Turbinicarpus saueri subsp. nelissae, commonly known as the Nelissae Turbinara, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to southern Africa. It is a small, globular cactus with a distinctive ribbed structure and a dense covering of white, woolly hair. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are often followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
