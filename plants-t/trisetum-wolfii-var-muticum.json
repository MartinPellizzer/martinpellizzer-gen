    "intro": "Trisetum wolfii var. muticum, commonly known as the swamp muhly, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it thrive in moist environments. Trisetum wolfii var. muticum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
