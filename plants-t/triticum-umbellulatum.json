    "intro": "Triticum umbellulatum, commonly known as the goat grass, is a wild relative of wheat that belongs to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces small, clustered spikelets that form a panicle inflorescence. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Triticum umbellulatum is of interest to plant breeders due to its potential for improving wheat varieties through genetic diversity."
