    "intro": "Tonshia polypetala, commonly known as the African bellflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous, and it prefers well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. Tonshia polypetala is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
