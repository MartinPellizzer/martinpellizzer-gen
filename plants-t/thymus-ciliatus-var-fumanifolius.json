    "intro": "Thymus ciliatus var. fumanifolius, commonly known as the smokeleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features aromatic, narrow, gray-green leaves that emit a strong thyme scent when crushed. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage and fragrant properties."
