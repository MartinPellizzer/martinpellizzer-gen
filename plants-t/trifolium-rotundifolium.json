    "intro": "Trifolium rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three rounded leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Trifolium rotundifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
