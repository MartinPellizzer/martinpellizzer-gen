    "intro": "Tendana, commonly known as the \"lady's tears\" or *Aeschynanthus* species, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from red to purple. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped blooms that are often borne in dense inflorescences along the stems. Tendana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture to maintain its vibrant appearance. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets and indoor gardens."
