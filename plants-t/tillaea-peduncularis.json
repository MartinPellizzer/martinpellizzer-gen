    "intro": "Tillaea peduncularis, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Tillaea peduncularis thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for survival in harsh, dry environments."
