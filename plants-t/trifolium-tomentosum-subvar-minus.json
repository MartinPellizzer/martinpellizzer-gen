    "intro": "Trifolium tomentosum subvar. minus, commonly known as the lesser hairy vetch, is a low-growing leguminous plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves and hairy stems. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in early spring. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment. It is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
