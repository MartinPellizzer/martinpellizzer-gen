    "intro": "Tectaria \u00d7 bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbiferous shield fern, is a hybrid species within the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often hairy fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant produces bulbils along the margins of its fronds, which are specialized structures that can develop into new plants. These bulbils are a key feature for vegetative propagation. Tectaria \u00d7 bulbifera is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky crevices."
