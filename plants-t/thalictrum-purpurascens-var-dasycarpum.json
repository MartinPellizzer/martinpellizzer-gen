    "intro": "Thalictrum purpurascens var. dasycarpum, commonly known as the purple-stemmed meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often turn a striking purplish hue as the plant matures. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in compound umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with numerous small, ovate leaflets that are arranged alternately along the stem. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance and ecological benefits."
