    "intro": "Trattinnickia rhoifolia var. lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its upright growth habit and dense foliage. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the late spring and early summer. This plant is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
