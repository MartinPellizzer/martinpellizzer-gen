    "intro": "Tragacantha ajubensis, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems, narrow leaves, and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a valuable resin, known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine, food, and as a binding agent. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Tragacantha ajubensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
