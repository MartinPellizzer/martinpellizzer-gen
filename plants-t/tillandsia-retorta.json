    "intro": "Tillandsia retorta, commonly known as the twisted air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces inflorescences with showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires minimal watering, making it a popular choice for terrariums and indoor gardens. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, Tillandsia retorta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
