    "intro": "Taraxacum fasciatum, commonly known as the dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a flowering head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets. It produces a distinctive seed head, or pappus, which consists of feathery bristles that aid in wind dispersal. This plant is widely distributed across temperate regions and is known for its medicinal and ecological significance."
