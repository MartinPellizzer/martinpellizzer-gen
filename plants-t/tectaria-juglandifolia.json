    "intro": "Tectaria juglandifolia, commonly known as the walnut-leaf tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, lobed fronds that resemble the shape of a walnut leaf, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal."
