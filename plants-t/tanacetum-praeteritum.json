    "intro": "Tanacetum praeteritum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers appear in clusters and bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Tanacetum praeteritum is known for its strong, camphor-like scent, which is due to the presence of essential oils in its leaves and stems."
