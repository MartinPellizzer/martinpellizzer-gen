    "intro": "Trisetum cernuum, commonly known as the nodding hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and wetlands. The plant features slender, arching stems that bear small, spike-like clusters of pale green to blue-green grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of compact, drooping clusters of spikelets, which give it its characteristic nodding appearance. Trisetum cernuum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
