    "intro": "Thelypteris trachyphylla, commonly known as the rough fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in the Americas. It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds, which are divided into small, overlapping pinnae that give it a dense, feathery appearance. The fronds are typically dark green and have a rough, textured surface due to the presence of small, raised dots on the leaflets. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
