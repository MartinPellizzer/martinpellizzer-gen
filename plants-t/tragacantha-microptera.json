    "intro": "Tragacantha microptera, commonly known as the small-winged tragacanth, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by pods that contain lens-shaped seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with small, rounded leaflets, and the plant is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Tragacantha microptera is valued for its ability to thrive in harsh conditions and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
