    "intro": "Trifolium pratense subsp. sativum, commonly known as red clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its purple or pink flowers that bloom in dense, spherical clusters. The plant is well-known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in agriculture as a forage crop and for soil enrichment. Additionally, it has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
