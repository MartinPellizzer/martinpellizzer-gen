    "intro": "Thelypteris decussata var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in a soft, velvety texture due to the presence of dense, fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The botanical characteristics of this fern make it a distinctive and ornamental species in horticulture."
