    "intro": "Tounatea madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascan starfish plant, is a unique member of the Araliaceae family native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
