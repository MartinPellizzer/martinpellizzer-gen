    "intro": "Trifolium dipsaceum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clover, is a flowering plant species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Trifolium dipsaceum is a low-growing perennial that plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a food source for various pollinators."
