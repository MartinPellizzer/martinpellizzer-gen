    "intro": "Tanacetum subcorymbosum, commonly known as the sweet everlasting, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a strong, aromatic scent and is often used in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its common name derives from the lasting fragrance of its dried flowers, which retain their scent for extended periods."
