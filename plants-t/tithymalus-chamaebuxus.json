    "intro": "Tithymalus chamaebuxus, commonly known as the creeping tithymalus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens across southern Europe and parts of North Africa."
