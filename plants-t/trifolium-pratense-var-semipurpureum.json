    "intro": "Trifolium pratense var. semipurpureum, commonly known as the purple clover, is a variant of red clover characterized by its distinctive purplish hue on the leaves and flower stems. This perennial herb is native to Europe and has been naturalized in many parts of North America. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a slight pubescence. The flowers are small, pink to purple, and arranged in dense, globular clusters, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in forage and soil conservation due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities."
