    "intro": "Teramnus lanceolifoliolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf teramnus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in warmer climates."
