    "intro": "Torenia nantoensis, commonly known as the Nantoensis Morning Glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep purple. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite, ovate leaves that are hairy beneath. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, a trait that gives it its common name. Torenia nantoensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in warm, humid climates."
