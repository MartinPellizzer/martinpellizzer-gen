    "intro": "Thlaspi alpestre, commonly known as alpine pennycress, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its seeds are encased in a hard, dry fruit called a siliqua, which disperses through wind or water. Thlaspi alpestre is known for its ability to tolerate harsh climates and is often found in high-altitude ecosystems."
