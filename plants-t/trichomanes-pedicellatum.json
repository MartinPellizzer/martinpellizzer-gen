    "intro": "Trichomanes pedicellatum, commonly known as the creeping fern, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered in small, rounded clusters called sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds."
