It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and clusters of pink or reddish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is well adapted to dry, saline soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to survive in harsh, desert-like conditions. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
