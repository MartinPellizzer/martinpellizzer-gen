    "intro": "Triglochin bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in marshes, pond edges, and other moist habitats, where it thrives in saturated soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Triglochin bulbosa is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels."
