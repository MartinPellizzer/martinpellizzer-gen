    "intro": "Turpinia pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved turpinia, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible berries. It is often found in sandy or well-drained soils in forested areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
