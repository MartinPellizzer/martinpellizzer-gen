    "intro": "Triadenum japonicum f. turfosum, commonly known as the Japanese triadenum foliage form, is a variant of the Triadenum japonicum species native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and compact rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale pink, typically in late spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground covers in shaded environments."
