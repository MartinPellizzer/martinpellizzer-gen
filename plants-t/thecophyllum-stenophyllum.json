    "intro": "Thecophyllum stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed thecophyllum, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific alpine environments. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh, high-altitude conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its reproductive structures are enclosed within specialized bracts, a feature that aids in protecting the reproductive organs from environmental stress. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
