    "intro": "Taraxacum remanentilobum, commonly known as the remnant lobed dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus, which aids in its propagation. It is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. Its botanical features make it a notable species for ecological studies and botanical gardens."
