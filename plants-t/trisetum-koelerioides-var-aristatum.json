    "intro": "Trisetum koelerioides var. aristatum, commonly known as the aristate false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is notable for its distinctive aristate (bristle-tipped) lemma, which aids in seed dispersal."
