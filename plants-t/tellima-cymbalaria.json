    "intro": "Tellima cymbalaria, commonly known as the small bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale blue. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces small, dry fruits that contain several seeds. Tellima cymbalaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
