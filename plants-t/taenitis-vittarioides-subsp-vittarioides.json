It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental appearance. The fronds are pinnately divided and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to botanical gardens."
