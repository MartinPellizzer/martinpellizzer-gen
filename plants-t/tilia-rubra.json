    "intro": "Tilia rubra, commonly known as the red-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn a vibrant red in the fall, adding visual interest to the landscape. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming more furrowed with age. Tilia rubra is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland areas."
