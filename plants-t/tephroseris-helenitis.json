    "intro": "Tephroseris helenitis, commonly known as the Helen's tephroseris, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive shape that aids in pollination by insects. Tephroseris helenitis is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
