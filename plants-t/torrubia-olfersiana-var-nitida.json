    "intro": "Torrubia olfersiana var. nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf willow, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in streamside habitats. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, followed by cylindrical, woody fruits. The variety nitida is distinguished by its more pronounced silvery foliage compared to other varieties of Torrubia olfersiana."
