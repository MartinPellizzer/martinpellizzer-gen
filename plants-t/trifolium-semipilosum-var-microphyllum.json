    "intro": "Trifolium semipilosum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the dwarf hairy clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of southern Africa. It features small, trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
