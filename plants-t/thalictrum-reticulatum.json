    "intro": "Thalictrum reticulatum, commonly known as the common rue-anemone, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm, featuring delicate, fern-like leaves and showy, white or pale pink flowers. The plant blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed, and is often found in moist woodlands and stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and is known for its ability to thrive in partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The flowers are typically arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
