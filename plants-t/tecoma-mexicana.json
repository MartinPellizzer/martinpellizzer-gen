It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and oval-shaped with a rough texture. Tecoma mexicana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping."
