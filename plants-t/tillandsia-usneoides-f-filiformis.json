    "intro": "Tillandsia usneoides f. filiformis, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic bromeliad that thrives on trees in humid environments. It lacks true roots and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its fibrous, thread-like structures. The plant is characterized by its long, hanging strands that form dense, moss-like clusters. It is often mistaken for a parasitic plant, but it does not harm its host. This variety is notable for its delicate, silver-green foliage and its role in tropical ecosystems."
