    "intro": "Toxicodendron coriaceum, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fuzzy berries. The plant contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation in many individuals. Its leaves are alternate, compound, and have a distinctive, serrated appearance. The plant is often found in moist, wooded areas and is a common component of the understory in eastern North American forests."
