    "intro": "Trifolium usambarense, commonly known as the Usambare clover, is a perennial legume native to East Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland areas. Trifolium usambarense plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
