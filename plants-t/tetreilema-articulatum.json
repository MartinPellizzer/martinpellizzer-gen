    "intro": "Tetreilema articulatum, commonly known as the articulated tetrastigma, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems that are often segmented and covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, and its fruits are berry-like, containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
