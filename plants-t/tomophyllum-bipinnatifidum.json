The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often divided into two parts, giving it the species name \"bipinnatifidum.\" Tomophyllum bipinnatifidum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with mechanisms to store water and reduce transpiration."
