    "intro": "Trichomanes preslianum, commonly known as the Presleian huperbole, is a rare and specialized fern belonging to the family Huperboliaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. This plant is epiphytic, growing on the surfaces of trees in humid, shaded environments, primarily in tropical regions. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of its leaves. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Trichomanes preslianum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
