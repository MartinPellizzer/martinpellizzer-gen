    "intro": "Tephroseris fussii, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of velvety, fleshy leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of violet, pink, and white, which bloom from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Tephroseris fussii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
