    "intro": "Tetrapasma, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Araceae. It comprises several species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plants are characterized by their showy, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Tetrapasma species typically grow as herbaceous perennials, often with thick, fleshy roots. They are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value, though some species contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
