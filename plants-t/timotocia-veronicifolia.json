    "intro": "Timotocia veronicifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Timotocia veronicifolia is often found in dry forests and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
