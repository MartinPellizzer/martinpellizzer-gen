    "intro": "Telipogon diabolicus, commonly known as the devil's orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure. The plant produces striking, often violet or dark-colored flowers that are adapted for specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and highly sought after by botanists and conservationists. Its botanical study contributes to understanding the evolutionary adaptations of high-altitude flora."
