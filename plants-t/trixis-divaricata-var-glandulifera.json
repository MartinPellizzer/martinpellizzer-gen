    "intro": "Trixis divaricata var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular trixis, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its branched stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in panicle-like inflorescences, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves and stems are adapted to reduce water loss, featuring thick cuticles and succulent structures. This species is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited to harsh, semi-arid environments."
