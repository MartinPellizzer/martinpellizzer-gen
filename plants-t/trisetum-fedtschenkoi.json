    "intro": "Trisetum fedtschenkoi, commonly known as the Fedtschenko's wood rush, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is native to the cold climates of the northern hemisphere, particularly in regions with high altitudes and moist, well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in alpine and subarctic environments, where it contributes to the vegetation cover. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered an indicator species for harsh, nutrient-poor habitats."
