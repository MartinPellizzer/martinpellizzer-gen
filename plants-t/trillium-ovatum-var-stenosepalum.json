    "intro": "Trillium ovatum var. stenosepalum, commonly known as the narrow-sepal trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its three broadly ovate leaves and three white or pale pink petals that are typically shorter than those of the typical Trillium ovatum. The plant produces a single erect stem with a showy, three-lobed flower that blooms in early spring. It thrives in shaded, moist woodland environments and is often found in areas with rich, acidic soil. This variant is distinguished by its narrower sepals and is considered a rare and less common form within the Trillium genus."
