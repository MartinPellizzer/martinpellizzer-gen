    "intro": "Trixis ophiorhiza subsp. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular trixis, is a shrub native to parts of Africa, particularly in regions with sandy or coastal soils. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in coastal dunes and sandy habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. The subspecies is distinguished by the presence of glandular structures on its stems and leaves, which contribute to its unique botanical features."
