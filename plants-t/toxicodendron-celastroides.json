    "intro": "Toxicodendron celastroides, commonly known as the stinkwood tree, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by clustered, red or orange berries. It contains urushiol, a toxic resin that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided or handled with care."
