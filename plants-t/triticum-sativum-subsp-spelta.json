    "intro": "Triticum sativum subsp. spelta, commonly known as spelt, is an ancient grain that belongs to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive awns and compact spikelets, which are features typical of the wheat genus. The plant has a shorter growing season compared to modern wheat varieties, making it well-suited for cooler climates. Its grains are encased in a tough hull, which is removed during processing to reveal the edible endosperm. Spelt is valued for its nutrient density and has been cultivated for thousands of years in Europe."
