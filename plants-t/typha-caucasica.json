    "intro": "Typha caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian cattail, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence composed of a brown, fibrous stem covered with dense, fluffy seeds. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its rhizomes are extensive and help stabilize the soil, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in water filtration and as a habitat for various wildlife species."
