    "intro": "Tapinanthus sakarensis, commonly known as the Sakar\u00e9nsis dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Madagascar. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to other plants through specialized root-like structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is part of the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its vine-like growth habit and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host species."
