    "intro": "Trifolium rydbergii, commonly known as Rydberg's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Native to the western United States, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its growth habit and floral structure make it a valuable component of native plant communities and a subject of ecological study."
