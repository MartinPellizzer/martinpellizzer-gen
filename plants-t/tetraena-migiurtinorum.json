    "intro": "Tetraena migiurtinorum, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic alkaloids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Tetraena migiurtinorum is often found in rocky or sandy areas, contributing to the ecological diversity of its environment."
