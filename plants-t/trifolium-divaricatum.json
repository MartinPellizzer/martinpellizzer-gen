    "intro": "Trifolium divaricatum, commonly known as the spreading clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Trifolium divaricatum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems as a source of nectar for pollinators."
