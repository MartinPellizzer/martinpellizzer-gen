    "intro": "Thalictrum saxicola, commonly known as the alpine meadow rue, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and delicate, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Thalictrum saxicola thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its growth habit and floral structure make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
