    "intro": "Thismia kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the montane rainforests of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the family Thismiaceae, a group of plants known for their mycoheterotrophic lifestyle, meaning they lack chlorophyll and rely on fungi for nutrients. The plant produces striking, lantern-like inflorescences that are often white or pale yellow, giving it an ethereal appearance. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological uniqueness. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
