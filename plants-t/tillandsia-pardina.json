    "intro": "Tillandsia pardina, commonly known as the pink tillandsia, is a species of air plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. This epiphytic plant thrives by absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, rather than through soil. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. The plant produces striking pink or red flowers that bloom from the central rosette, adding visual interest to its appearance."
