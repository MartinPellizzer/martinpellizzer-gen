    "intro": "Tephroseris tichomirovii, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Mongolia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool and moist conditions. The plant features showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Tephroseris tichomirovii is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and is often found in open, well-drained areas."
