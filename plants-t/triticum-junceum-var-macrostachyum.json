It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and large, feathery inflorescences that can reach several feet in height. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in open woodlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers in the summer months. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
