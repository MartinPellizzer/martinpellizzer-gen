    "intro": "Taraxacum polium, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant typically grows in alpine and rocky habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and are usually covered in fine hairs. The flower heads produce a cluster of small yellow flowers that develop into fluffy seed heads, facilitating wind pollination and seed dispersal."
