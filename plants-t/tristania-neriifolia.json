    "intro": "Tristania neriifolia, commonly known as the black-leafed tristania, is a shrub native to the Cape Region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are often glossy and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, which bloom during the cooler months. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Tristania neriifolia is often found in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates."
