    "intro": "Tephrocactus lagopus var. aureopenicillatus, commonly known as the golden penstemon cactus, is a rare and unique variant of the tephrocactus genus. It is native to the arid regions of Mexico, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant features a short, cylindrical stem with dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its foliage consists of spiny, woolly stems that provide protection from herbivores and extreme temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
