    "intro": "Trifolium nigrescens subsp. nigrescens, commonly known as black clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, dark purple to black flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed sites. Due to its unique coloration and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
