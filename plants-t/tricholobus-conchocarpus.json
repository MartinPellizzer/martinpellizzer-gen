    "intro": "Tricholobus conchocarpus, commonly known as the conchocarpus mushroom, is a species of bracket fungus belonging to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped, woody fruiting bodies that often grow on dead wood. The cap is typically pale yellow to brown, with a smooth or slightly fibrillose surface. The stem is short and stubby, and the spore-bearing surface is located on the underside of the cap. This fungus is saprophytic, decomposing dead wood and playing a role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems."
