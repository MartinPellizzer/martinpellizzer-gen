    "intro": "Taxus baccata f. pendula-graciosa, commonly known as the weeping and graceful yew. This ornamental variant of the European yew exhibits a distinctive weeping habit with long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect. The foliage consists of dark green, needle-like leaves that remain throughout the year, providing evergreen structure. It produces small, red berries in the autumn, which are an important food source for birds. The plant is slow-growing and requires well-drained soil, making it suitable for garden landscapes where its unique form can be appreciated."
