    "intro": "Thecacoris lenifolia, commonly known as the slender leaf orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in cloud forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Thecacoris lenifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
