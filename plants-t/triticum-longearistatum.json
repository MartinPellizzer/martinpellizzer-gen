    "intro": "Triticum longearistatum, commonly known as the long awn wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and long, bristle-like awns that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Triticum longearistatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
