    "intro": "Tetrapterys monteverdensis, commonly known as the Monteverde tetraleaf, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its four-winged leaves, which are a distinctive feature of the genus Tetrapterys. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique microclimate of its high-altitude habitat. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
