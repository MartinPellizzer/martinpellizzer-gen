    "intro": "Terebinthus schlechtendalii, commonly known as the desert terebinth, is a shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. It is often used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Its resilience to harsh environmental conditions makes it an important species in desert ecosystems."
