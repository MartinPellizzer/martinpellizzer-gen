    "intro": "Toxicodendron typhinum, commonly known as the itch leaf or poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged oppositely. The plant contains urushiol, a potent allergen that causes skin irritation and contact dermatitis in many individuals. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests and disturbed soils, and is often found in temperate regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to avoid contact with the plant and to take precautions when handling it."
