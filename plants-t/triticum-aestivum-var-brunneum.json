    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. brunneum, commonly known as red wheat, is a variety of wheat characterized by its reddish husk and bran color. It is a hexaploid species, meaning it has six sets of chromosomes, which contributes to its genetic diversity and adaptability. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with alternate, narrow leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds, which are the primary product, are used for flour production and contain a high concentration of gluten. This variety is valued for its nutritional content and is often used in traditional and artisanal baking."
