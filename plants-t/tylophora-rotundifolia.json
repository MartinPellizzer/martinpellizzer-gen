    "intro": "Tylophora rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf tylophora, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its small, opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers, which are often borne on slender pedicels. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Tylophora rotundifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions."
