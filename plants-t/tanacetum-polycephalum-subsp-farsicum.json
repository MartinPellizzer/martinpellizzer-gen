    "intro": "Tanacetum polycephalum subsp. farsicum, commonly known as Persian tansy, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that resemble those of other members of the Asteraceae family. The plant is characterized by its aromatic foliage, which contains compounds such as thymol and carvacrol, giving it a strong, camphor-like scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used traditionally in herbal remedies for its antiseptic and digestive benefits."
