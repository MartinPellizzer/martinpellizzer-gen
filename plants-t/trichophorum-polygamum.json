    "intro": "Trichophorum polygamum, commonly known as the purple moorgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils, often found in heathlands, bogs, and along the edges of marshes. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its ability to retain moisture in wetland environments. Trichophorum polygamum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
