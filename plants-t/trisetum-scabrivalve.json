    "intro": "Trisetum scabrivalve, commonly known as the roughleaf beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive hairy surface that aids in water retention. The inflorescence consists of a loose to dense cluster of spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family Poaceae."
