    "intro": "Triticum intermedium subsp. pouzolzii, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass subspecies pouzolzii, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, typically reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil, making it a resilient species. Its botanical features make it of interest for ecological restoration and forage production."
