    "intro": "Trichomanes punctatum subsp. floridanum, commonly known as Florida maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in minute, scale-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and stream banks, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its spores are released in small, clustered structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
