    "intro": "Terminalia oxyphylla, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by overharvesting. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
