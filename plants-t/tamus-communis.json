    "intro": "Tamus communis, commonly known as the common bird's-nest, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a dense, cushion-like rosette of broad, waxy, dark green leaves that form a protective layer around its flowering structures. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically green or white, clustered in a central umbel that resembles a bird's nest, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
