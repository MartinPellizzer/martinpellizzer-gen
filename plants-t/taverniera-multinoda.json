    "intro": "Taverniera multinoda, commonly known as the clustered bottlebrush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its unique floral structure and drought tolerance contribute to its ecological and ornamental value in arid landscapes."
