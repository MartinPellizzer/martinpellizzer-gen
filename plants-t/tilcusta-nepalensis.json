    "intro": "Tilcusta nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments at high altitudes. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor in rocky or soil substrates. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
