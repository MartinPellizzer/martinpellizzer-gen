    "intro": "Taraxacum frigidopratense, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to cold regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering head that produces numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations. Its leaves are typically covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. Taraxacum frigidopratense is adapted to withstand freezing temperatures and is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
