    "intro": "Thuja plicata var. pendula, commonly known as the lacey arborvitae, is a cultivar of the western red cedar. It is characterized by its finely dissected, feathery foliage that gives it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant has a conical shape when young, which tends to flatten out as it matures. It is native to the Pacific Northwest of North America and thrives in USDA hardiness zones 5 through 8. This evergreen is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate urban conditions."
