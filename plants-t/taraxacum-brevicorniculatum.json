    "intro": "Taraxacum brevicorniculatum, commonly known as the short-horned dandelion, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a single, yellow composite flower head that develops into a white, fluffy pappus for wind dispersal. The plant is native to southern Europe and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has a taproot system and is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed environments. The species is also valued for its medicinal properties, though it is less commonly cultivated than other dandelion species."
