It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and distinctive, lobed leaves that are typically hairy. This plant is native to specific regions in Central Asia and is often found in dry, grassy habitats. Its botanical features include a short, thick rhizome and a crown of basal leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
