    "intro": "Thalictrum sylvaticum subsp. godronii, commonly known as Godron's meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces numerous stamens and a single pistil, typical of its subfamily. The subspecies godronii is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flowering habits compared to the typical form of T. sylvaticum."
