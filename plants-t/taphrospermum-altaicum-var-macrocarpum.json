    "intro": "Taphrospermum altaicum var. macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited taphrospermum, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage, which provide habitat for various small animals and insects. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by large, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a slightly hairy texture, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. This species is valued for its ecological role and is often found in dry, rocky environments."
