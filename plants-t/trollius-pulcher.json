It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features a short, stout stem that rises from a rhizomatous root system, and its leaves are deeply lobed with a rough texture. Trollius pulcher thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Its medicinal properties have been historically recognized, though it contains toxic compounds that require careful handling."
