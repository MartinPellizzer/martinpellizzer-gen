    "intro": "Tephrosia maxima, commonly known as the giant tephrosia, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are encased in slender, cylindrical pods, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Tephrosia maxima is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
