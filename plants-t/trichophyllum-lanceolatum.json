    "intro": "Trichophyllum lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceolate trichophyllum, is a rare and unique member of the Pteridaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia in clusters along the margins of its leaves, which are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
