    "intro": "Tristagma leichtlinii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss. Tristagma leichtlinii is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush habitats."
