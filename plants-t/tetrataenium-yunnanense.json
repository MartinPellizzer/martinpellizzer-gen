    "intro": "Tetrataenium yunnanense, commonly known as the Yunnan tetrataenium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important subject for botanical research."
