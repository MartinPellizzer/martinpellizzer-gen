It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a globe-shaped seed head. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant is known for its taproot and its ability to produce numerous wind-dispersed seeds. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
