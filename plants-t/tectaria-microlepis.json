    "intro": "Tectaria microlepis, commonly known as the small-leaf tectaria, is a fern species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as tropical forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of hair, which helps retain moisture. Tectaria microlepis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
