    "intro": "Triticum spontaneum f. albonigrum, commonly known as wild emmer wheat with a white-black form, is a wild grass species native to the Fertile Crescent. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow to brown florets. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in temperate climates. This subspecies is of interest to researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to environmental stress."
