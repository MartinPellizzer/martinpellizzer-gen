    "intro": "Triticum spelta var. viridoalbispicatum, commonly known as green-white awned spelt, is a rare and less commonly cultivated variant of spelt wheat. It is characterized by its distinctive green and white awns, which give it a unique appearance compared to other spelt varieties. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is known for its hardy nature. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that bear small, husked grains. This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptability."
