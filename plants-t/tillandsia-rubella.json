    "intro": "Tillandsia rubella, commonly known as the red tillandsia, is a species of air plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to Central and South America, where it typically grows on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are usually red or orange, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. Tillandsia rubella is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and unique aesthetic."
