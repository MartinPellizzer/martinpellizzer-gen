It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and finely divided. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
