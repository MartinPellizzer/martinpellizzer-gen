    "intro": "Telipogon portillae, commonly known as the Portilla's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, intricate flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers, which are usually pale green or white, are adapted for specific pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Telipogon portillae is considered a vulnerable species."
