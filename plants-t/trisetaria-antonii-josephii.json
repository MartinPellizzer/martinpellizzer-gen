    "intro": "Trisetaria antonii-josephii, commonly known as the Josephine's trisetaria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
