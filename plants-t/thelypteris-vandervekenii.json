    "intro": "Thelypteris vandervekenii, commonly known as the Vanderveken's shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Thelypteris vandervekenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
