It typically grows in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in woodland edges, thriving in full sun to partial shade. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. The species is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction, making it a common weed in various habitats."
