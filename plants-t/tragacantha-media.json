    "intro": "Tragacantha media, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to regions of the Middle East and Central Asia, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid climates. The plant is characterized by its woody, branching structure and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its most notable feature is the production of a viscous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert species."
