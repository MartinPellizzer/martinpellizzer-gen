    "intro": "Taxodium huegelii, commonly known as the Hugel's bald cypress, is a deciduous conifer native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that turn a striking reddish-brown in the fall before dropping. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, typical of the Cupressaceae family. Its bark is fibrous and peels in long, vertical strips, revealing a mottled appearance. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or riparian habitats."
