    "intro": "Trema grevei, commonly known as the African snowberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in spring, followed by round, fleshy berries that turn red when mature. These berries are edible and often consumed by birds and small mammals. Trema grevei is well adapted to dry conditions and is commonly found in rocky or coastal areas."
