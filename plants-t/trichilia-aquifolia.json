It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a broad, spreading canopy. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface and a prominent midrib. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and clustered in panicles, typically blooming in the spring. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
