    "intro": "Trichonema pylium, commonly known as the common liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a thalloid structure, consisting of a flat, ribbon-like body that is often covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures. It reproduces through spores, which are produced in specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its lobes. Trichonema pylium plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms."
