    "intro": "Tardavel arvensis, commonly known as the field vetch, is an annual legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces slender, elongated pods that contain several seeds. It is often found growing in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in cultivated fields. Tardavel arvensis plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility."
