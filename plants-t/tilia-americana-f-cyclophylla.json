    "intro": "Tilia americana f. cyclophylla, commonly known as the cyclophylla linden, is a unique form of the American linden tree. It is characterized by its distinctive, nearly circular leaves that set it apart from the typical oval-shaped foliage of the species. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit and often displays a more symmetrical branching pattern. The flowers are similar to those of the standard Tilia americana, producing fragrant, pale yellow blooms in early summer. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
