    "intro": "Tithymalus cebrinus, commonly known as the creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet, typically blooming in early summer. The plant has aromatic, hairy leaves that are often used in culinary applications due to their strong thyme scent. Its creeping growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. Tithymalus cebrinus is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
