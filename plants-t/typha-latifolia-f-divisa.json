    "intro": "Typha latifolia f. divisa, commonly known as the divided cattail, is a variant of the common cattail characterized by its distinctive, divided leaves. This plant is a wetland species that thrives in shallow water and moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of lakes and ponds. Its leaves are broad and flat, with a prominent midrib and a fibrous, spongy texture. The plant produces a dense, cylindrical spike of brown, fluffy seeds at the end of its stem, which disperses easily by wind. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
