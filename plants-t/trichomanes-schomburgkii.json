    "intro": "Trichomanes schomburgkii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's maidenhair fern, is a member of the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive frilly margin, and its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the leaves. It prefers well-drained, nutrient-poor substrates and is often found on tree trunks or rocks. Trichomanes schomburgkii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
