    "intro": "Torularia pectinata, commonly known as the woolly broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and fuzzy, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in association with leguminous plants. Its unique morphology and parasitic lifestyle make it an interesting subject in botanical studies. It is native to regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa."
