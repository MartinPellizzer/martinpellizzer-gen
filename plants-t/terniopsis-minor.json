    "intro": "Terniopsis minor, commonly known as the small terniopsis, is a small shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, which helps it conserve moisture in its arid habitat. Terniopsis minor is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
