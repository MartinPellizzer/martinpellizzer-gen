    "intro": "Thymus chamaedrys var. vestitus, commonly known as the pale thyme or woolly thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features compact, creeping stems covered in dense, soft white or grayish hairs, giving it a distinctive woolly appearance. The leaves are small, ovate, and covered with a similar hairy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically pink or pale purple, borne in small clusters during the spring and early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
