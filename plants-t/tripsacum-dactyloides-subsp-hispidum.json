    "intro": "Tripsacum dactyloides subsp. hispidum, commonly known as hairy wild barley, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and its distinctive hairy leaves and stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species with potential for use in restoration ecology. Its genetic diversity has also made it a valuable resource for breeding programs aimed at improving maize and other grass species."
