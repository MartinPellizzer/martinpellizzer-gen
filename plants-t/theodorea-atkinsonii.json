    "intro": "Theodorea atkinsonii, commonly known as the Atkinson's lily, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking white or pale pink flowers with a subtle fragrance. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often in rocky or forested habitats. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces small, clustered flowers during the spring season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
