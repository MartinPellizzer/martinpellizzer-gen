    "intro": "Tillandsia biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water and nutrients from the air. It produces two showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Tillandsia biflora is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
