    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 eggleri, commonly known as the woolly thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and aromatic properties."
