    "intro": "Trillium giganteum var. angustipetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled giant trillium, is a striking perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a single, showy white or pale pink flower with three broad, recurved petals and three sepals that are narrower than the petals. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with a basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves. It thrives in rich, moist woodland soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern in many regions."
