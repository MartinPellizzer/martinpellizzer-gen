    "intro": "Tragacantha robbinsii, commonly known as the Robbins' tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces a distinctive resinous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
