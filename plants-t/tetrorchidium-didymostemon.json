    "intro": "Tetrorchidium didymostemon, commonly known as the twin-lobed orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru, where it thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive two-lobed structure, typically in shades of white and pink. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
