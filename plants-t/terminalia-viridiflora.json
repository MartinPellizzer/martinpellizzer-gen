    "intro": "Terminalia viridiflora, commonly known as green-flowered terminalia, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, winged seeds. Terminalia viridiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine."
