    "intro": "Tectaria beccariana, commonly known as the Beccarian tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Tectaria beccariana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
