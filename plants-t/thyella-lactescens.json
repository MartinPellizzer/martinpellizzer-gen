    "intro": "Thyella lactescens, commonly known as the milkweed bladder, is a unique plant native to arid regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its swollen, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant's most distinctive feature is its inflated, bladder-like structures, which are adapted for seed dispersal by wind."
