It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are often covered in soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
