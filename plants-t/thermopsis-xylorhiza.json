    "intro": "Thermopsis xylorhiza, commonly known as yellow rocket, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and fern-like leaves, which are typical of the Papaveraceae family. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as streambanks and wet meadows. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Thermopsis xylorhiza is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
