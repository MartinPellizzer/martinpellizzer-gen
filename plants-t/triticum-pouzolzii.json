    "intro": "Triticum pouzolzii, commonly known as the wild wheat or Persian wheat, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial plant that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, leafy stems and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, two-lobed spikelets that contain both male and female flowers, making it a monoecious species. Its seeds are enclosed in tough, straw-colored glumes, and the plant is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Triticum pouzolzii is often found in rocky soils and is considered a valuable forage plant for livestock."
