    "intro": "Tium desperatum, commonly known as the desert thorn, is a resilient shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater sources. Tium desperatum plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
