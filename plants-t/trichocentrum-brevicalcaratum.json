It features a sympodial growth habit with a short, thick rhizome and produces compact, clustered inflorescences. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a distinctive, short spur that gives the species its name. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and arranged in two rows along the stem. This orchid thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
