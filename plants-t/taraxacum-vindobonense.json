    "intro": "Taraxacum vindobonense, commonly known as the Vienna dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the dandelion genus, characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, leafy stem. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a ball of white, fluffy seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and roadsides. Botanically, it is notable for its medicinal properties and historical use in traditional herbal remedies."
