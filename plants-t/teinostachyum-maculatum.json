    "intro": "Teinostachyum maculatum, commonly known as the spotted bamboo, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its slender, green stems with distinctive red or purple markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps, making it a popular ornamental grass in tropical gardens. Teinostachyum maculatum is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
