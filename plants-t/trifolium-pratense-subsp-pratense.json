    "intro": "Trifolium pratense subsp. pratense, commonly known as red clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in globular clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Red clover is also valued for its role in agriculture as a forage crop and for its nitrogen-fixing abilities."
