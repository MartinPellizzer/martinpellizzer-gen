    "intro": "Tricholoma elatinoides, commonly known as the silky webcap, is a species of fungus that belongs to the Tricholomataceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, white to pale yellow cap that becomes sticky when touched, and a slender, cylindrical stem with a fibrous sheath. The gills are initially white and turn pale yellow with age, and the spores are typically smooth and ellipsoid in shape. This fungus is often found in association with grasses and heathland vegetation, growing in temperate regions. It is considered edible but is not commonly foraged due to its subtle flavor and occasional confusion with more toxic species."
