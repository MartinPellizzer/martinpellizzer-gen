    "intro": "Tragacantha kotschyana, commonly known as the Kotschy's tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by distinctive pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Tragacantha kotschyana is also valued for its gum, which has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a natural thickening agent."
