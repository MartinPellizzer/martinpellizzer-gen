    "intro": "Tanacetum hispidum, commonly known as hedge hyssop, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to purple flower heads that resemble those of thistles. The plant has finely hairy leaves, which give it its scientific name \"hispidum,\" meaning \"rough\" or \"hairy.\" It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Tanacetum hispidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
