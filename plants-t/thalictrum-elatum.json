The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, making it a striking addition to woodland or meadow gardens. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Thalictrum elatum thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a versatile choice for shady garden spaces."
