It features small, compact foliage with narrow, grey-green leaves that are densely packed, giving it a mat-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, pale pink to white flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rocky or sandy habitats. This subspecies is valued for its aromatic properties and is often used in herbal medicine and as a ornamental plant."
