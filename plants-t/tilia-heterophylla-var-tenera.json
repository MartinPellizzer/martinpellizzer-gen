    "intro": "Tilia heterophylla var. tenera, commonly known as the woolly maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy leaves that are often lobed and have a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by small, winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
