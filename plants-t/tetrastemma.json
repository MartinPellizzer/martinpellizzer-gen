It is characterized by its opposite, often palmately lobed leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, with four stamens and a two-lobed stigma. Tetrastemma species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. They are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
