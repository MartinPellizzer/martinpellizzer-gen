It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, often colorful foliage. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with lance-shaped leaves that can vary in color depending on environmental conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in dense inflorescences, and are pollinated by insects. The plant is adapted to withstand drought, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
