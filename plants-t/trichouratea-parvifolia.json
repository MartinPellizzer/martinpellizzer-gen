It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Trichouratea parvifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
