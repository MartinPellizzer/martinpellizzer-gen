    "intro": "Tragopogon sosnowskyi, commonly known as the Sosnowsky's goatgrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, spiky seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common strategy among grasses. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its unique genetic makeup, it has been studied for its role in evolutionary biology and hybridization."
