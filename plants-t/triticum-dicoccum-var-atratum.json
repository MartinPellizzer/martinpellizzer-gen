    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum var. atratum, commonly known as black rye, is a wild relative of common rye (Triticum aestivum) and is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black grains that are typically smaller than those of common rye. The plant has a robust root system and produces spikelets that are often clustered along the stem. It thrives in cooler climates and is often found in meadows and forested areas. Due to its hardy nature and potential for use in traditional and organic agriculture, it has garnered interest for its resilience and nutritional value."
