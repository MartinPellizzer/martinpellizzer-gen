It is characterized by its hairy, often grayish stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or along rocky outcrops. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
