    "intro": "Trisetum alpestre var. tatrense, commonly known as the Alpine trisetum, is a grass species native to high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous narrow, awn-tipped lemma-like structures. This variety is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems and its resilience to environmental stress."
