    "intro": "Tillandsia flagellata, commonly known as the flagellate air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender, and often pendulous leaves that resemble a whip, giving it its common name. The plant does not require soil, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves via a process called foliar absorption. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Tillandsia flagellata is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
