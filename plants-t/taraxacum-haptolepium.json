    "intro": "Taraxacum haptolepium, commonly known as the sticky dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family. It is characterized by its hairy, spiny stems and heart-shaped basal leaves. The plant produces a single, hollow, wind-dispersed seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in dry, disturbed soils. Its unique features, including the sticky hairs on its stems, help it retain moisture in arid environments."
