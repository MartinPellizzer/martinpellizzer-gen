    "intro": "Thelypodiopsis torulosa, commonly known as the cushion moss, is a small, compact moss that forms dense, cushion-like growths. It is characterized by its closely packed, short, upright shoots and dark green, glossy foliage. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky or sandy soils in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature. Thelypodiopsis torulosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for small invertebrates."
