    "intro": "Trichoscypha laxissima, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The tree produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
