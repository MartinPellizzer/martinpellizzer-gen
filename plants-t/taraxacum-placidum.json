    "intro": "Taraxacum placidum, commonly known as the quiet dandelion, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, hollow, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus, which is typical of the genus Taraxacum. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as fields and roadsides. Its botanical features make it a common and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
