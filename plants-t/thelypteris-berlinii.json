    "intro": "Thelypteris berlinii, commonly known as the Berlin holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are usually short and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it to the substrate. Thelypteris berlinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
