It features a tall, unbranched stem that resembles a candlestick, with small, clustered leaves at the top. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its striking appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens."
