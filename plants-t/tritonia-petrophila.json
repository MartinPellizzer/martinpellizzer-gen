    "intro": "Tritonia petrophila, commonly known as the rock tritonia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tuberous roots and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple and blue. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers cool, moist environments. Tritonia petrophila is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these ecosystems. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
