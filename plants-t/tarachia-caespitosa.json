    "intro": "Tarachia caespitosa, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with prominent yellow centers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, oval, and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Tarachia caespitosa plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
