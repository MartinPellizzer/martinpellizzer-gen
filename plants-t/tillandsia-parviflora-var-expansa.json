    "intro": "Tillandsia parviflora var. expansa, commonly known as the broad-leaved air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, often with a bluish or grayish hue. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. This variety is valued for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it popular among indoor plant enthusiasts."
