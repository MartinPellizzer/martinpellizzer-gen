It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces showy, spire-like clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Thalictrum acutilobum is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits to pollinators."
