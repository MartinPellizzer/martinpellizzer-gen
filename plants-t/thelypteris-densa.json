    "intro": "Thelypteris densa, commonly known as the dense shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features a creeping rhizome with dense, leathery fronds that are often dark green in color. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris densa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its lush, dense foliage."
