    "intro": "Tillandsia straminea, commonly known as the silver tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hair. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and minerals from the air. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a grayish-green coloration that helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Tillandsia straminea produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its overall appearance."
