    "intro": "Trevesia eminens, commonly known as the tall trevesia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina and Chile. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, which bloom during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a leathery texture, while its bark is smooth and grayish in color. Trevesia eminens is adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
