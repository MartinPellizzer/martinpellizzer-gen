    "intro": "Tillandsia cryptantha, commonly known as the cryptantha air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple in color. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
