    "intro": "Trichilia gardneri, commonly known as African shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related species. The tree is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its fruit produces a hard, woody seed that is commercially valuable for its oil, similar to shea butter. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is also cultivated for its economic benefits."
