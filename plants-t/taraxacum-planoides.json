    "intro": "Taraxacum planoides, commonly known as the flatleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate, smooth, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, hollow, and usually yellowish stem that bears a composite flower head. Its flowers develop into a spherical, fluffy seed head known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and grassy areas."
