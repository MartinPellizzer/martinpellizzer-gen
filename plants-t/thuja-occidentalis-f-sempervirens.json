    "intro": "Thuja occidentalis f. sempervirens, commonly known as the eastern arborvitae, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer with a pyramidal shape and dense, scale-like foliage. It is native to eastern North America and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form a compact, upright form. The plant has flattened, dark green leaves that are arranged in crossed pairs along the branches. It produces small, yellowish female cones that mature into blue-black seeds. This cultivar is highly resistant to pests and diseases, making it a popular choice for hedges and foundation plantings."
