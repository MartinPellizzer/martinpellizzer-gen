    "intro": "Thymus balansae var. pseudomarschallianus, commonly known as the Balkan thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its aromatic, small, grey-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is often cultivated in gardens and herbal practices."
