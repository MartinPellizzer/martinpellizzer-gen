It is characterized by its pale white petals with distinct red veins, which give it its distinctive appearance. This plant is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded woodlands. It has three broadly ovate leaves and produces a single, erect flower with three petals. The red-striated form is particularly rare, making it a sought-after species among botanists and plant enthusiasts."
