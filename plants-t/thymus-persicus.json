    "intro": "Thymus persicus, commonly known as Persian thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves and pink or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, contribute to its medicinal and culinary uses. Thymus persicus is often used in traditional medicine for its antimicrobial and antispasmodic properties."
