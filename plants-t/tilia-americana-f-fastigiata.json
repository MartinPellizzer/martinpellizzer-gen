    "intro": "Tilia americana f. fastigiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved linden, is a compact, columnar form of the American linden. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a dull green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. It is native to eastern North America and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and shade-providing canopy. This variety is relatively slow-growing and suitable for smaller gardens or urban landscapes."
