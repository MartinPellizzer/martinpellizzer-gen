    "intro": "Trattinnickia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact stature, typically reaching only a few inches in height, and its clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are densely packed, providing a dense, mat-like appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Trattinnickia humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form a lush, evergreen ground cover."
