    "intro": "Thesium comosum, commonly known as the woolly thesium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the family Xanthorrhoeaceae, which includes plants known for their showy inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a spike-like cluster, and it typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. Thesium comosum is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops."
