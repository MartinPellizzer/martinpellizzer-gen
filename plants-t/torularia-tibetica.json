    "intro": "Torularia tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan torula, is a rare fungal species native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the Ascomycota phylum and is characterized by its unique morphology, including small, yellowish to orange-colored ascocarps. The fungus thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found on decaying plant matter in alpine ecosystems. Its spore production occurs through ascospores, which are released into the air to disperse the fungus. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to mycologists studying fungal adaptation to extreme climates."
