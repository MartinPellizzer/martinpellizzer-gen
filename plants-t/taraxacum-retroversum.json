    "intro": "Taraxacum retroversum, commonly known as the reverse spear thistle, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright, spiny stems and basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by the development of bristly, seed-filled spheres. It is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
