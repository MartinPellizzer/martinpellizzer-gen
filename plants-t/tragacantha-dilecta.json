    "intro": "Tragacantha dilecta, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure with compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by pods containing seeds. It is well-adapted to dry environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access groundwater. The resinous sap of Tragacantha dilecta has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive."
