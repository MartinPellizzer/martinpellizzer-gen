    "intro": "Triodia spicata, commonly known as spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant has narrow, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Triodia spicata plays a crucial role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife. It is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, drought-prone conditions."
