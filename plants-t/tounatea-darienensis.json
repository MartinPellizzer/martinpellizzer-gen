    "intro": "Tounatea darienensis, commonly known as the Darien fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense rainforests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are relatively short and produce a dense cluster of fertile fronds that bear spores on the undersides. Tounatea darienensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitats."
