    "intro": "Tillandsia goudae, commonly known as the Gouda air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale purple in color. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
