It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in wet, marshy habitats. The plant has a slender, unbranched stem and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose spike. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged soil in which it thrives. The species is noted for its unique floral structure and is of interest to botanists studying orchid diversity in the region."
