    "intro": "Tribolium pusillum, commonly known as the minute grain beetle, is a small, reddish-brown beetle belonging to the family Curculionidae. It is typically found in stored grains and is known for its ability to infest a variety of cereal crops. The plant-associated life cycle of this species is closely linked to its host plants, where it feeds on seeds and plant debris. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a pest in agricultural settings. Due to its small size and cryptic behavior, it is often overlooked in ecological studies."
