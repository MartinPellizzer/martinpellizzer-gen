    "intro": "Trisetum yunnanense, commonly known as Yunnan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with fine, wiry leaves. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small and often bristle-tipped. Trisetum yunnanense plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
