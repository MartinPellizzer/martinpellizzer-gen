It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in open grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
