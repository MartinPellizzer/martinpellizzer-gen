    "intro": "Thelypteris valida, commonly known as the valid fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. Thelypteris valida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
