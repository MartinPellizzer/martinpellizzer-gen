    "intro": "Tilia henryana var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are smooth on both sides, distinguishing it from other linden varieties. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are an important food source for pollinators. Its bark is grey and smooth, with a tendency to flake as the tree matures. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its shade and aesthetic qualities."
