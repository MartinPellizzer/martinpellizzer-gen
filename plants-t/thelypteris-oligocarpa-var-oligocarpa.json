    "intro": "Thelypteris oligocarpa var. oligocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its graceful appearance."
