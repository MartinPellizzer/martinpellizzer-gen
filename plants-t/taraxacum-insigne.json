    "intro": "Taraxacum insigne, commonly known as the noble dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and serrated, basal leaves that form a rosette. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in temperate climates and moist soils. The plant produces a distinctive seed head that releases lightweight seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, contributing to ecological biodiversity."
