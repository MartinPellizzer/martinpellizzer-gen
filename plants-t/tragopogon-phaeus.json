    "intro": "Tragopogon phaeus, commonly known as the yellow goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and ray florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, followed by bristly seed heads that disperse its seeds by wind. Tragopogon phaeus is also known for its edible leaves, which have a slightly bitter taste and are sometimes used in salads."
