    "intro": "Thuarea media, commonly known as the common thuaria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features erect, branching stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Thuarea media is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soils."
