It is an epiphytic plant that thrives without soil, attaching itself to trees or other structures. Its foliage forms a rosette that collects moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It is native to Central and South America and is popular as a low-maintenance indoor plant."
