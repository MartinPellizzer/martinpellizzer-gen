    "intro": "Tillandsia antillana, commonly known as the \"Air Plant of the Caribbean,\" is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant that absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through soil. The plant features rosette-shaped foliage with long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes. It produces striking inflorescences with bright orange or yellow flowers that bloom once in its lifetime. This species is native to the tropical regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central America."
