    "intro": "Toxicodendron radicans var. eximium, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed sumac, is a variant of the stinkhorn tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown stems and alternate, pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that contain seeds. It is known for its toxic sap, which can cause severe skin irritation upon contact. This variant is often found in woodland areas and is part of the Anacardiaceae family."
