    "intro": "Trichoneura grandiglumis var. minor, commonly known as the small-leaf trichoneura, is a rare grass species native to specific regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, narrow leaves that are typically shorter and more compact compared to the main species. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with delicate, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
