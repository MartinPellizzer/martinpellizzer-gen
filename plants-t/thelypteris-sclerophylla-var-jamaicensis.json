    "intro": "Thelypteris sclerophylla var. jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to the Caribbean region. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive shield-like shape, which gives it its common name. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients in its native habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady gardens."
