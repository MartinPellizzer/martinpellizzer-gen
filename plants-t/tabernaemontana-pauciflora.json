    "intro": "Tabernaemontana pauciflora, commonly known as the rare or sparse-flowered oleander, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, fleshy leaves and a branching structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for warm, arid climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
