    "intro": "Thecophyllum balanophorum var. subpictum, commonly known as the painted ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white stems and leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly outlines. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is highly vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat destruction. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure the survival of this unique and elusive species."
