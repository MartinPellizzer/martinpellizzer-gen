It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a yellow flowering head. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes. It produces a hollow, leafy stem that supports its composite flower head. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
