It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features slender, often hairy stems that bear whorled clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its leaves are deeply divided with sharp, pointed lobes, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The species is notable for its delicate, lace-like foliage and its role in supporting pollinators in its native ecosystems."
