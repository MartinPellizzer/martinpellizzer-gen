    "intro": "Tillandsia pinifolia, commonly known as the pine needle tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, hair-like trichomes. These trichomes help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its roots for anchorage rather than for nutrient uptake. Its striking silver-green foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
