    "intro": "Trifolium heterodon, commonly known as the heterodon clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in temperate climates. Trifolium heterodon is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
