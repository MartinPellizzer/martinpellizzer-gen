    "intro": "Thalictrum pulchellum, commonly known as the showy meadow-rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in compound umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with multiple pairs of lance-shaped leaflets, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Thalictrum pulchellum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows."
