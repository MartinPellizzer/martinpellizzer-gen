It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and can reach heights of up to 60 cm. Its seeds are small and dark, often used in traditional herbal medicine.
