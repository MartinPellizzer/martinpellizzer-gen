    "intro": "Trichomanes gemmatum, commonly known as the golden huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, glandular hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in terminal clusters, a feature typical of many ferns. Trichomanes gemmatum is notable for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its role in maintaining ecological balance in its habitat."
