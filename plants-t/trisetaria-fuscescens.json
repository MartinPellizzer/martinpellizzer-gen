    "intro": "Trisetaria fuscescens, commonly known as the black sandgrass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand saline and arid conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
