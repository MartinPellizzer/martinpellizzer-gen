The plant features rosette-shaped foliage that can range in color from green to reddish-brown, depending on light exposure. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences that are often pink or purple, adding visual interest to its appearance. Due to its unique growth habits and aesthetic appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
