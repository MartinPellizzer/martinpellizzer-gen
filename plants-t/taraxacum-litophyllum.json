    "intro": "Taraxacum litophyllum, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and rocky environments in the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces a yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets, typical of the dandelion genus. Its fibrous root system is adapted to anchor it in loose, mineral-rich soils. Taraxacum litophyllum is often found in crevices and on rocky slopes, where it thrives in low-nutrient, well-drained conditions."
