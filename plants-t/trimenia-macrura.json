    "intro": "Trimenia macrura, commonly known as the long-stalked sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, prostrate stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Trimenia macrura is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
