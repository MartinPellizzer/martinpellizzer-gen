    "intro": "Triticum elegans, commonly known as the slender wheat, is a species of grass native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets. While not widely cultivated for grain production, it is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic diversity. Its ecological role includes contributing to soil stability and serving as a food source for various insects and wildlife."
