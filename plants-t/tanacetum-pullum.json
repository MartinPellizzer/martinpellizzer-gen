    "intro": "Tanacetum pullum, commonly known as the alpine tansy, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces ray florets that are typically pale yellow, surrounded by a disk of tubular flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Tanacetum pullum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
