    "intro": "Tetrahit, commonly known as the \"four-leaf clover,\" is a rare variant of the Oxalis genus. It is characterized by its distinctive four leaves, which are often considered a symbol of good luck. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a vibrant green color, with the fourth leaf often being smaller and more delicate. Tetrahit is not only valued for its aesthetic appeal but also for its potential medicinal properties."
