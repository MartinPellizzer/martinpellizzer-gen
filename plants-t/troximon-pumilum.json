    "intro": "Troximon pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf broom, is a small shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a desirable plant for xeriscaping."
