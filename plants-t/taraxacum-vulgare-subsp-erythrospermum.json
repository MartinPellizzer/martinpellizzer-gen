    "intro": "Taraxacum vulgare subsp. erythrospermum, commonly known as the red-seeded dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flower heads that bloom in early spring, followed by elongated, hollow stems and heart-shaped basal leaves. The subspecies is distinguished by its reddish-brown seeds, which are more prominent than those of the typical dandelion. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. This plant is also known for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
