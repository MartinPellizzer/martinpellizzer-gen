    "intro": "Timotocia integrifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf timotocia, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth-edged. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to purple, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
