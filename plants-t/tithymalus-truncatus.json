    "intro": "Tithymalus truncatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tithymalus, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, this plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and full sun exposure. It is often found in grasslands and along coastal areas, where it contributes to local biodiversity. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
