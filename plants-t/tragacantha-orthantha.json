    "intro": "Tragacantha orthantha, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant is known for its latex-like sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of gum arabic."
