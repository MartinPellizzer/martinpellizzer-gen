    "intro": "Thalictrum paniculatum, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, branched stems that rise from a rhizomatous root system, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences of small, greenish-white flowers, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are compound, with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a feather-like pattern. Thalictrum paniculatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and stream banks."
