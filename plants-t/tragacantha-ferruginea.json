    "intro": "Tragacantha ferruginea, commonly known as the red gum tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces a resinous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrubland and coastal areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
