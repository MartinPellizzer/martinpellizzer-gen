    "intro": "Tillandsia \u00d7 rex, commonly known as the royal tillandsia, is a hybrid air plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped foliage that traps moisture. The plant's leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, allowing it to absorb water and nutrients from the air. It produces striking violet or purple inflorescences that bloom in the spring. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor displays."
