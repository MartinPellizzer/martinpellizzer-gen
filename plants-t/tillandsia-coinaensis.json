    "intro": "Tillandsia coinaensis, commonly known as the Coinaensis air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in capturing water and light. It produces small, bell-shaped inflorescences with violet or purple flowers, and it is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance. Tillandsia coinaensis is relatively easy to care for, requiring minimal watering and indirect sunlight."
