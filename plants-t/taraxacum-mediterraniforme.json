    "intro": "Taraxacum mediterraniforme, commonly known as the Mediterranean dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a white pappus for wind dispersal. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats. The plant is perennial, with a taproot system that allows it to survive in harsh environmental conditions. Its morphology and ecological adaptations make it a resilient and widespread species in its native range."
