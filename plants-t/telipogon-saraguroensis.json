    "intro": "Telipogon saraguroensis, commonly known as the Saraguro orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and specialized growth habits. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its small, delicate flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it has a short, compact stem with a few leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telipogon saraguroensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
