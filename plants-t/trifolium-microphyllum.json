    "intro": "Trifolium microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved clover, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Trifolium microphyllum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria."
