    "intro": "Taraxacum oxyphoreum, commonly known as the white-rayed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a long, slender stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, white-pubescent pappus that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
