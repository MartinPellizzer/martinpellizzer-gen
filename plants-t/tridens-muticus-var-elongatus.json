    "intro": "Tridens muticus var. elongatus, commonly known as the long-beak twayblade, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. This herbaceous plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It has slender, erect stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and often clustered at the base, while its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
