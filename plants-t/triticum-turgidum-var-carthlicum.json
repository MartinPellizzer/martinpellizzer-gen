    "intro": "Triticum turgidum var. carthlicum, commonly known as Carpathian wheat, is a botanical variant of the wheat species Triticum turgidum. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. This variety is native to the Carpathian Mountains and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, which are the reproductive structures of the plant. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop."
