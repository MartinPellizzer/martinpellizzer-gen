    "intro": "Tina apiculata, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that have a distinctive pointed tip. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are a source of food for birds and other wildlife. Tina apiculata thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plantings."
