    "intro": "Thalictrum flavum var. columnare, commonly known as the yellow meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in a dense layer of silky, white or pale yellow hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to woodland or meadow gardens. Its leaves are compound, with multiple narrow, feather-like leaflets that give it a feathery appearance. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments."
