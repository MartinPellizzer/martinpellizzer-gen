It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a pale purple hue. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. This variety is notable for its unique branching pattern, which distinguishes it from other clover species."
