    "intro": "Thelypodium crenatum, commonly known as the smooth thelypodium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with finely toothed margins. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences and are usually pink to purple in color. Thelypodium crenatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
