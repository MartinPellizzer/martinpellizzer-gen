    "intro": "Tarasa tenuis, commonly known as the slender tarasa, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many ornamental and horticulturally significant species. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically tubular and come in shades of pink or white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tarasa tenuis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
