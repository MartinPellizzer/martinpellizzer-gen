    "intro": "Testudinaria sylvatica, commonly known as the forest turtlehead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the woodlands of eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces spikes of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a common sight in forest understories. Testudinaria sylvatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native wildlife."
