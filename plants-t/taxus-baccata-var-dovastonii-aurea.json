    "intro": "Taxus baccata var. dovastonii-aurea, commonly known as the golden yew, is a striking variant of the common yew. It is characterized by its vivid golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its dark green stems and reddish-brown bark. This plant is evergreen, retaining its foliage year-round, and is native to parts of Europe. The golden yew is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and slow growth rate. It produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals."
