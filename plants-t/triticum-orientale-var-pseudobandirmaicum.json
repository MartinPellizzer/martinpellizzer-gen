    "intro": "Triticum orientale var. pseudobandirmaicum, commonly known as the Eastern wheatgrass variant, is a lesser-known grass species with unique botanical characteristics. It is native to Central Asia and exhibits a compact growth habit with dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences, typical of the Poaceae family, and has a fibrous root system. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue that distinguishes it from other wheatgrass species. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its potential for ecological or agricultural applications."
