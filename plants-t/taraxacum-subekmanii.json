    "intro": "Taraxacum subekmanii, commonly known as the Subekman's dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a parachute-like structure called a pappus. It is typically found in moist, disturbed soils and is native to parts of Asia. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
