    "intro": "Trisetum altijugum, commonly known as the highland bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
