It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of blue and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its habitat. Its slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves are well-suited for survival in cold, arid climates. Tibetoseris gracilipes is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and potential ecological significance in its native range."
