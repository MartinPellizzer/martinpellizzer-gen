    "intro": "Taraxacum divulsifolium, commonly known as the split-leaved dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed or split, giving it its common name. The plant produces a single, hollow, hairless stem that supports a bright yellow flower head, which develops into a spherical seed sphere with parachute-like seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal uses in traditional herbal remedies."
