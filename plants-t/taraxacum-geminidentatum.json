    "intro": "Taraxacum geminidentatum, commonly known as the twin-toothed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a spherical seed ball. Native to southern Europe, this plant thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. Its leaves have a distinctive arrangement of two small teeth at the tip, giving it its specific epithet. The plant is often mistaken for other dandelion species but can be distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences."
