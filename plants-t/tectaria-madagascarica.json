    "intro": "Tectaria madagascarica, commonly known as the Madagascar shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, large, leathery fronds that are often covered in a thick, protective layer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as tropical forests. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, facilitating its reproductive cycle."
