    "intro": "Thymus leptophyllus subsp. paui, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with aromatic, small, grey-green leaves that are densely packed along the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its essential oils contain thymol and carvacrol, giving it a strong aromatic profile and medicinal uses."
