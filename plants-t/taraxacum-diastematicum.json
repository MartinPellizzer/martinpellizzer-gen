    "intro": "Taraxacum diastematicum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright stem and deeply lobed, grass-like leaves that are narrower than those of common dandelions. The plant produces a single, hollow, explosive seed head that disperses its seeds via the wind. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Taraxacum diastaticum is a perennial herb that typically blooms in late spring to early summer."
