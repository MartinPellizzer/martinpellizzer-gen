    "intro": "Trichotosia collina, commonly known as the mountain trichotosia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native habitat."
