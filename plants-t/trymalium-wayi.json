    "intro": "Trymalium wayi, commonly known as the Wayi mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It attaches to the branches of eucalyptus and other host trees, deriving some of its nutrients through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to habitat loss, Trymalium wayi is considered vulnerable, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts for this unique species."
