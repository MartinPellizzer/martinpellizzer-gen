    "intro": "Thysselinum cantabrigense, commonly known as the Cantabrian thyselinum, is a rare flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors or rocky slopes. Its botanical features include a slender stem and an umbel-like arrangement of flowers, which are often clustered near the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
