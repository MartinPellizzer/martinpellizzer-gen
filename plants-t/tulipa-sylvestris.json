    "intro": "Tulipa sylvestris, commonly known as the woodland tulip, is a perennial bulbous plant native to Central Asia and parts of Eastern Europe. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange, typically blooming in early spring. The plant thrives in woodland habitats with partial shade and well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a dense rosette at the base. Tulipa sylvestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to naturalize in suitable environments."
