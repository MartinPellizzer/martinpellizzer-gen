    "intro": "Tripleurospermum maritimum var. agreste, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiky, blue or purple flower heads surrounded by white, waxy bracts. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in salt marshes and dunes. It has a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its saline environment. Sea holly is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
