    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 pseudoflavescens, commonly known as the golden linden, is a hybrid species within the Tilia genus, characterized by its ornamental value and unique botanical features. It typically exhibits leaves that are broadly ovate to heart-shaped, with a smooth margin and a yellow-green hue on the underside. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bark is generally smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. Tilia \u00d7 pseudoflavescens is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is adapted to a range of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions."
