It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and the presence of a unique, ear-shaped structure on its fronds. The plant's fronds are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, overlapping arrangement of leaflets. Tectaria blepharorachis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important component of tropical ecosystems."
