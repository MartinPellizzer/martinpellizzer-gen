    "intro": "Troximon glaucum var. asperum, commonly known as the roughleaf glaucum, is a variant of the glaucum plant characterized by its distinctive rough or hairy texture on its foliage. It is native to certain regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky environments. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often blue-green in color, giving it a striking visual appearance. It produces small, pale blue or white flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in arid gardens and rockeries."
