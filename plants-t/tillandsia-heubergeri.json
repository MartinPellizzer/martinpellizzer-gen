    "intro": "Tillandsia heubergeri, commonly known as the Heuberger's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking violet or purple inflorescences that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia heubergeri is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
