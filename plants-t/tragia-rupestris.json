    "intro": "Tragia rupestris, commonly known as the rock tragia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a small, erect annual herb with branched stems and hairy leaves adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. Tragia rupestris is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
