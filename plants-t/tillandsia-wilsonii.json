    "intro": "Tillandsia wilsonii, commonly known as the Wilson's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Mexico. It belongs to the Tillandsia genus, which is known for its ability to grow without soil, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can trap water and provide a habitat for small organisms. It produces striking clusters of white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in the spring or summer. Tillandsia wilsonii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
