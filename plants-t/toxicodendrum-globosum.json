    "intro": "Toxicodendrum globosum, commonly known as the globular poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to parts of the southeastern United States. It is a shrub characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round berries that are toxic and can cause skin irritation upon contact. It contains urushiol, a potent allergen responsible for the characteristic rash associated with poison ivy. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in natural habitats and requires caution during handling."
