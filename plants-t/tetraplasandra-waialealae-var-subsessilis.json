    "intro": "Tetraplasandra waialealae var. subsessilis, commonly known as the Kona false hibiscus, is a rare endemic plant native to the island of Hawaii. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments on the slopes of volcanoes. It has distinctive, pale green, waxy leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack stalks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
