    "intro": "Tricholepis angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed tricholepis, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in shaded environments, and it is often found in rich, loamy soils. Tricholepis angustifolia is valued for its ecological role in supporting local insect populations and its ornamental potential in shaded gardens."
