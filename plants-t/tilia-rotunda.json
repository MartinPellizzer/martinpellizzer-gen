    "intro": "Tilia rotunda, commonly known as the round-leaf lime, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically rounded at the base and have a serrated margin. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Tilia rotunda is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in wooded areas."
