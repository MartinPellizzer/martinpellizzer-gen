    "intro": "Tradescantia commelinoides var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf spiderwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, adding visual interest to gardens. The plant produces small, three-petaled flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense ground covers, which helps suppress weeds and prevent soil erosion."
