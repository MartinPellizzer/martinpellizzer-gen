    "intro": "Taraxacum guttulatum, commonly known as the spotted dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The leaves are typically covered with small, raised dots or glands, giving the plant its common name. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem that supports the flower and is often used as a seed dispersal mechanism. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils."
