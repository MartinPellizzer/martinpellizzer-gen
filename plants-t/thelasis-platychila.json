    "intro": "Thelasis platychila, commonly known as the broad-leaved thelasis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their mild diuretic properties. Thelasis platychila thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens and dry landscapes."
