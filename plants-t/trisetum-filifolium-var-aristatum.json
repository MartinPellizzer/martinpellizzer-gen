It is characterized by its fine, feathery foliage and distinctive tufts of flowering heads that emerge from the base of the plant. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a bluish-green color, and the inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
