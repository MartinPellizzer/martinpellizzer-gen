    "intro": "Torularia humilis var. maximowiczii, commonly known as the dwarf torularia, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture for its ability to form dense, attractive ground cover."
