    "intro": "Trifolium lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Trifolium lanceolatum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration and agriculture."
