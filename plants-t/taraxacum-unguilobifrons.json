    "intro": "Taraxacum unguilobifrons, commonly known as the broad-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow flowering head that develops into a puffed, white seed dispersal mechanism. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has a taproot system and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional herbal medicine."
