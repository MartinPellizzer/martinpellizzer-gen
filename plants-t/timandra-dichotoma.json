    "intro": "Timandra dichotoma, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and feathery foliage, which are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. The plant has a woody stem with dichotomous branching, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are simple and opposite, often with a slightly hairy texture. Timandra dichotoma plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
