It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving them a shiny appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
