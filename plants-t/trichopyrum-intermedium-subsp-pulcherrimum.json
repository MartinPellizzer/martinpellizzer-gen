    "intro": "Trichopyrum intermedium subsp. pulcherrimum, commonly known as the showy false flax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained to wet soils. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its showy, yellowish-green flowers are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
