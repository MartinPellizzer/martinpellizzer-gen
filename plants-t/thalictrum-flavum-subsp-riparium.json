    "intro": "Thalictrum flavum subsp. riparium, commonly known as the river meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to moist, temperate regions of Europe. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows along riverbanks and wet meadows, where it thrives in consistently moist soil. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and ornamental value."
