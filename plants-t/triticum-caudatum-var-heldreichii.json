    "intro": "Triticum caudatum var. heldreichii, commonly known as the Heldreich's goatgrass, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with long, narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has small, pale blue or greenish flowers and produces small, tough grains that are not typically used for food but are of interest in botanical and genetic studies. This variety is considered a relative of cultivated wheat and may contribute to genetic diversity in wheat breeding programs."
