    "intro": "Toxicoscordion gramineum, commonly known as the western poison hemlock, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters, typical of the carrot family. It contains toxic alkaloids, such as cicutoxin, which can be harmful to humans and animals if ingested. Due to its similarity to edible plants, it is often mistaken for parsley or wild carrot, making it a potential hazard in natural environments."
