    "intro": "Tapinanthus mortehanii, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from its host. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on the roots of larger trees. Its parasitic nature allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils by tapping into the vascular system of its host."
