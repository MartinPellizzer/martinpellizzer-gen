    "intro": "Tragia marginata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Mexican fireweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, velvety leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Tragia marginata has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes, though its botanical properties remain under study."
