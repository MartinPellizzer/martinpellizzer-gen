    "intro": "Thelypteris acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-pointed shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually evergreen, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, elongated shape."
