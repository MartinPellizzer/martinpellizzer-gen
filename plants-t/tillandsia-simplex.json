    "intro": "Tillandsia simplex, commonly known as the silver vase bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that store water and help reduce transpiration. Its flowers are typically small, white or pale pink, and bloom in late spring or early summer. Tillandsia simplex is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
