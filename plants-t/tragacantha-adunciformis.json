It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and woody, thorny stems. The plant produces a valuable gum resin, which has been traditionally used in medicine and as a food additive. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
