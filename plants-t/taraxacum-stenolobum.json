    "intro": "Taraxacum stenolobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a crown of white, parachute-like seeds. Native to North America, it thrives in a variety of habitats, including disturbed soils and meadows. The plant is perennial, with a taproot system that allows it to survive through harsh conditions. Its botanical features make it a common weed in gardens and natural areas."
