It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or violet flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Teucrium cylindraceum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
