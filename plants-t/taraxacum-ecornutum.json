    "intro": "Taraxacum ecornutum, commonly known as the nutty dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a distinctive, spiky seed ball. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in its propagation. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Botanically, it is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and diverse ecological roles."
