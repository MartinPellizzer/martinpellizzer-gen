    "intro": "Trifolium traskiae, commonly known as Trask's clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to reddish in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Trifolium traskiae thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
