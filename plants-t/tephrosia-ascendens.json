    "intro": "Tephrosia ascendens, commonly known as the climbing tephrosia, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its twining stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy and have a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in agroforestry systems."
