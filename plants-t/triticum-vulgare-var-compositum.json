    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. compositum, commonly known as composite wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat that exhibits a unique combination of traits. It is characterized by its mixed grain structure, which includes both free-threshing and non-free-threshing grains within the same plant. This variability makes it distinct from standard wheat varieties and can influence its agricultural use. The plant typically grows as an annual grass with slender stems and spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both traditional and modern agricultural research."
