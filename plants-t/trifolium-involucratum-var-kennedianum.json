    "intro": "Trifolium involucratum var. kennedianum, commonly known as the Kennedian clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to lanceolate leaflets, often with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
