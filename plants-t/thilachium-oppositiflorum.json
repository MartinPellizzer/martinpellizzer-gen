    "intro": "Thilachium oppositiflorum, commonly known as the opposite-flowered pittosporum, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its opposite leaf arrangement and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the delicate blossoms. Thilachium oppositiflorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
