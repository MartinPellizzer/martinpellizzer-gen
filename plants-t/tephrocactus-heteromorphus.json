    "intro": "Tephrocactus heteromorphus, commonly known as the variable cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and adapting to its harsh environment. Tephrocactus heteromorphus is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to full sun exposure."
