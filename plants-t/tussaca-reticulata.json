    "intro": "Tussaca reticulata, commonly known as the nettle tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its woody stem and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive netted venation pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Tussaca reticulata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
