    "intro": "Taraxacum sonchoides, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a fluffy seed head known as a pappus, which is dispersed by the wind. It is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often considered a weed in lawns and gardens. Taraxacum sonchoides is also valued for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
