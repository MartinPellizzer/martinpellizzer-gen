    "intro": "Triticum aegilopoides var. larionowii, commonly known as the Siberian wild wheat, is a wild relative of cultivated wheat native to Central Asia. It is a grass species characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, steppe-like environments and has narrow, linear leaves with a rough texture. It produces small, beige to brownish grains that are not typically harvested for food but are valuable for genetic diversity in wheat breeding programs. This species is of interest to researchers due to its potential contributions to improving wheat resilience to environmental stresses."
