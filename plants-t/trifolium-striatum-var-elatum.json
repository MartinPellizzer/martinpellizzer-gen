    "intro": "Trifolium striatum var. elatum, commonly known as the tall narrow-leaf clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a narrow, elongated appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
