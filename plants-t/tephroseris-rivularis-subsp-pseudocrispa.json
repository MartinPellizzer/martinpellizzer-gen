    "intro": "Tephroseris rivularis subsp. pseudocrispa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tephroseris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly rolled at the edges. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters during the cooler months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
