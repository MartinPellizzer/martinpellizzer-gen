    "intro": "Tetrapogon triangulatus var. agowensis, commonly known as the Agowensis fern, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically arranged in a triangular pattern, giving it its scientific name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
