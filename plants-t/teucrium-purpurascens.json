    "intro": "Teucrium purpurascens, commonly known as purple germander, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped, blue to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Teucrium purpurascens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators."
