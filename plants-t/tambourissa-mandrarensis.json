    "intro": "Tambourissa mandrarensis, commonly known as the Madagascar tambourissa, is a climbing plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
