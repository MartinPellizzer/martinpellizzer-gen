    "intro": "Trifolium stellatum var. longiflorum, commonly known as the star clover, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils. It is a perennial herb that produces small, three-lobed seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often used in landscaping and for soil stabilization."
