    "intro": "Tragia nepetifolia var. genuina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tragia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, bead-like fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant in dry landscapes."
