    "intro": "Triticum glaucum subvar. elatius, commonly known as the tall blue wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and culms that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces spikelets with awned lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family, and blooms in late summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
