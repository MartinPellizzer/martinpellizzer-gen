    "intro": "Trifolium fragiferum var. majus, commonly known as the sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through its root nodules, making it valuable in soil enrichment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Its flowers are not only ornamental but also used in traditional medicine and as a source of honey."
