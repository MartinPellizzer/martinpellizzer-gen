    "intro": "Tovomitidium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom once a year, typically in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions."
