    "intro": "Terebinthus, commonly known as the turpentine tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Oleaceae. It is characterized by its aromatic, resinous wood and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces small yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Terebinthus species are native to regions of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. The tree is valued for its resin, which has been historically used in the production of turpentine and other industrial products."
