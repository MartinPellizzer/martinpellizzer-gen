    "intro": "Taraxacum glossocentrum, commonly known as the glossocentrum dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flower head. The flowers are typically yellow and are surrounded by a crown of bracts, which gives the plant its common name. It is native to southern Africa and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. The plant produces a distinctive seed head that disperses seeds via the wind, a common adaptation in the Asteraceae family."
