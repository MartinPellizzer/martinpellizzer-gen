    "intro": "Trochoseris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in arid or semi-arid regions. They are characterized by their basal rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring. The genus includes several species, many of which are adapted to poor soils and extreme temperatures. Trochoseris plants are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
