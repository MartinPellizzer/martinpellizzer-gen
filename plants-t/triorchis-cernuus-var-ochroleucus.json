    "intro": "Triorchis cernuus var. ochroleucus, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. It produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that are typically arranged in a spike, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus Triorchis. The plant is a perennial herb that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. The species is native to North America and is considered a rare and endangered plant in many parts of its range."
