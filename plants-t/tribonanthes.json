    "intro": "Tribonanthes, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and yellow composite flowers that resemble dandelions. Tribonanthes species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. They have a fibrous root system that helps them retain moisture in harsh environments. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
