    "intro": "Trifolium pratense var. fistulosum, commonly known as the slender clover, is a variant of red clover characterized by its slender stems and smaller leaves. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This variety is sometimes used in forage and as a cover crop due to its hardy nature and ecological benefits."
