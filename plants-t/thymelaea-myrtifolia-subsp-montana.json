    "intro": "Thymelaea myrtifolia subsp. montana, commonly known as mountain thymelaea, is a shrub native to the montane regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cooler, moist environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a desirable plant for rock gardens and alpine settings."
