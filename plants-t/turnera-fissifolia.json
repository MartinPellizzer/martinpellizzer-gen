It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically bright green with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of yellow, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Turnera fissifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
