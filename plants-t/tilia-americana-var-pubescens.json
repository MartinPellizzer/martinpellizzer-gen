    "intro": "Tilia americana var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences, producing a sweet, honey-like scent. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland areas. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
