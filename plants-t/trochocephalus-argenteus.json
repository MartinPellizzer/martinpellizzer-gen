    "intro": "Trochocephalus argenteus, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a silvery or whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in spring. Its stems are erect and can grow up to 1 meter in height, and the leaves are opposite, with a distinctive waxy texture. Trochocephalus argenteus is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in Mediterranean climates."
