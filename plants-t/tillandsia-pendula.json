    "intro": "Tillandsia pendula, commonly known as the hanging air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant has long, pendant leaves that form a rosette shape, allowing it to collect moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and moths. Tillandsia pendula is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
