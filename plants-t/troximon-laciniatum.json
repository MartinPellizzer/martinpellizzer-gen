Its leaves are deeply lobed and often appear fragmented, giving the plant a rugged, almost sculptural appearance. The plant is native to tropical regions and thrives in humid, warm environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Due to its unusual appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens and private collections."
