    "intro": "Trifolium pratense var. baeticum, commonly known as the Baetican red clover, is a variant of red clover native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, typically with three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. This variety is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
