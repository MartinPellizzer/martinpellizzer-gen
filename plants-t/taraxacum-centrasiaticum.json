    "intro": "Taraxacum centrasiaticum, commonly known as the Central Asian dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a fluffy, white pappus that allows the seeds to be carried by the wind. It is native to Central Asia and thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. This species is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
