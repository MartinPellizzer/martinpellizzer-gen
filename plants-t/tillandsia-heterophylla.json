    "intro": "Tillandsia heterophylla, commonly known as the silver pine tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Its unique ability to survive without soil makes it a popular choice for terrariums and indoor gardening. The plant produces striking white or pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette."
