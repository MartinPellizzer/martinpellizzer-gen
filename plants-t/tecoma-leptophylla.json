    "intro": "Tecoma leptophylla, commonly known as the yellow bells, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, characterized by its slender, often thorny stems. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warm seasons. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a velvety texture, while the fruit is a pod containing several seeds. Tecoma leptophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its bright, long-lasting blooms."
