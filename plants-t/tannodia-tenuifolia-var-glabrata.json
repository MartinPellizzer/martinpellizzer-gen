    "intro": "Tannodia tenuifolia var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-leaf tannodia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its slender, glabrous (smooth) leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in spring. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties due to the presence of tannins. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
