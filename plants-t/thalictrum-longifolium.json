    "intro": "Thalictrum longifolium, commonly known as the longleaf meadow-rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply divided and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy white or pale yellow flowers in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
