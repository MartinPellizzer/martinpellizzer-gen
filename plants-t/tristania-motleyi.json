    "intro": "Tristania motleyi, commonly known as the Tristania tree, is a flowering plant native to the Tristan da Cunha archipelago in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a small, evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal areas with nutrient-poor soils. The plant has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when dry. Tristania motleyi is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its remote and harsh environment."
