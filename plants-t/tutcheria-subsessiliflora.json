    "intro": "Tutcheria subsessiliflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tutcheria, is a flowering plant species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Tutcheria subsessiliflora plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
