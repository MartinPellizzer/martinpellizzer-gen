    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum subsp. polytrichus, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves and flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical thymus serpyllum."
