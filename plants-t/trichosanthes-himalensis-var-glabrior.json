It is a climbing vine characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically yellow with five lobes and are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits that mature to a pale green or yellowish color. This plant is often found in moist, temperate forests and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and pharmacological study."
