    "intro": "Triticum ponticum, commonly known as the Pontic wheat, is a species of wild wheat native to the Caucasus region. It is a herbaceous annual plant with a tall, slender stem and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in tough, glabrous grains that are adapted for dispersal by wind. Triticum ponticum is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic diversity and historical significance in wheat evolution."
