It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a spherical seed ball. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a taproot system and is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. The species is closely related to other dandelion species but can be distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and flowering structure."
