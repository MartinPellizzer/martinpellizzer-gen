It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters, featuring finely divided, fern-like leaves that are alternate along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early to mid-summer, which are borne on slender, branching stems. Its root system is fibrous, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially shaded environments. Thalictrum minus is often found in woodlands, stream banks, and meadows, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
