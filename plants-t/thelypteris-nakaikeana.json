    "intro": "Thelypteris nakaikeana, commonly known as the Nakai's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of sporangia on the undersides of the fronds. Thelypteris nakaikeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
