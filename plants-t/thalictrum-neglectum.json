    "intro": "Thalictrum neglectum, commonly known as the common meadow rue, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Thalictrum neglectum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
