    "intro": "Troostwykia singularis, commonly known as the singular gloryflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, showy, violet-blue petals that bloom in late spring. The plant has a woody stem with a rough, bark-like texture and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to climate change, it is considered an endangered species."
