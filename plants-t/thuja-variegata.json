    "intro": "Thuja variegata, commonly known as the golden thuja, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to Japan. It is characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and its striking variegated foliage, which features yellow-green and chartreuse hues. The leaves are scale-like and densely packed, giving the plant a lush, textured appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its compact size and attractive coloration, it is often used in rock gardens or as a specimen plant in gardens."
