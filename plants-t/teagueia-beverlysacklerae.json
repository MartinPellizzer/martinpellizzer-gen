    "intro": "Teagueia beverlysacklerae, commonly known as the Beverley Sackler cycad, is a rare and unique cycad species native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones ovoid, both resembling those of other cycad species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the specific microclimate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a critically endangered species."
