It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody pods containing several elliptical seeds. Teclea oubanguensis is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks, thriving in humid, tropical climates. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and has traditional uses in local communities."
