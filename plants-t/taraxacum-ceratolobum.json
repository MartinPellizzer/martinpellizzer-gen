    "intro": "Taraxacum ceratolobum, commonly known as the horned dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and a yellow flowering head that develops into a pappus-equipped seed parachute. Native to the western United States, it thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant has a taproot system and is known for its ability to colonize areas after fire or other disturbances. Its unique horn-like lobes on the leaves give it its common name and make it easily identifiable."
