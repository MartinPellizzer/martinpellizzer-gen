    "intro": "Tulipa lortetii, commonly known as the Lortet's tulip, is a rare and striking member of the tulip family native to Turkey. It is characterized by its large, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep red, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its bulbs are relatively small and require careful cultivation due to their sensitivity to moisture and temperature changes. Tulipa lortetii is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and unique floral display."
