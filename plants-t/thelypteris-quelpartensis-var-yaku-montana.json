    "intro": "Thelypteris quelpartensis var. yaku-montana, commonly known as the Yakutian mountain fern, is a fern species native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Mongolia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous areas with cool climates. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions and its unique adaptation to high-altitude ecosystems."
