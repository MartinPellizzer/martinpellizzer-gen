    "intro": "Terminalia kjellbergii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and elliptical leaves that turn yellow before shedding in the dry season. The tree produces small, white to pink flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
