    "intro": "Trapa kozhevnikoviorum, commonly known as the Kozhevnikov's water chestnut, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Trapaceae. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically borne on short stalks above the water surface. Its fruit is a spiny, bladder-like structure that contains one or two seeds. Trapa kozhevnikoviorum is native to freshwater habitats in Asia and is often found in still or slow-moving waters."
