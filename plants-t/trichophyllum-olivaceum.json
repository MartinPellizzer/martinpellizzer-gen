    "intro": "Trichophyllum olivaceum, commonly known as the olive-cap polypore, is a small, bracket-shaped fungus that grows on dead wood. It has a smooth, olive-green cap with a slightly sticky surface and a white, spongy underside. The fruiting body is typically less than 5 centimeters in diameter and often appears in clusters. It is primarily found in temperate regions, growing on decaying hardwoods. This fungus is saprophytic, playing a role in decomposing organic matter in forest ecosystems."
