    "intro": "Thelypteris rusbyi, commonly known as Rusby's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the fern family. Thelypteris rusbyi prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
