    "intro": "Triticum turgidum subsp. durum, commonly known as durum wheat, is a species of wheat native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hard, tough grains that are high in protein and gluten, making it ideal for pasta and semolina production. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stems and long, narrow leaves. Its florets are arranged in spikelets, and the grains are enclosed in tough, straw-colored glumes. This subspecies is well adapted to temperate climates and is a key crop in global agriculture."
