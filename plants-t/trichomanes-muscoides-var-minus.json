    "intro": "Trichomanes muscoides var. minus, commonly known as the lesser tassel fern, is a small, terrestrial fern species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often densely packed. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are typically clustered on the undersides of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its diminutive size and specialized habitat, it is a relatively rare and less commonly encountered fern species."
