    "intro": "Torulinium hayesii, commonly known as the Hayes' torula, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Torulaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, cup-like structure that resembles a small bowl. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid tropical forests. Its botanical features include a fleshy, greenish body with a central cavity that holds a cluster of small, spore-producing structures. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
