    "intro": "Tillandsia macdougallii, commonly known as the Macdougall's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Tillandsia macdougallii is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and requires minimal water."
