    "intro": "Triticum durum var. falcataffine, commonly known as durum wheat variant falcataffine, is a botanical variant of durum wheat, characterized by its unique genetic traits. This variety is primarily cultivated for its high gluten content, which is essential for producing strong dough used in pasta and semolina. The plant exhibits a robust growth habit with semi-dwarf stalks, making it suitable for high-yield agricultural practices. It typically flowers and matures earlier than standard durum wheat, adapting well to temperate climates. The grain is hard and has a high protein content, contributing to its versatility in food processing."
