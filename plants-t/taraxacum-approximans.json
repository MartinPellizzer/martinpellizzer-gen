    "intro": "Taraxacum approximans, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, inconspicuous yellow flower head. The flower head develops into a distinctive spherical seed head, known as a \"puffball,\" which releases lightweight seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas. This plant is also noted for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
