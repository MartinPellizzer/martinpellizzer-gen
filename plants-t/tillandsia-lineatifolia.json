    "intro": "Tillandsia lineatifolia, commonly known as the linear leaf air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is native to Central and South America. Its unique ability to survive in low-nutrient conditions makes it an interesting subject for botanical study."
