    "intro": "Toxocarpus borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean toxocarpus, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers with four petals. Its fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in the dense forest environment. Toxocarpus borneensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and ecological significance in its habitat."
