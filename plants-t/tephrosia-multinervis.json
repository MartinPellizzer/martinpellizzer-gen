    "intro": "Tephrosia multinervis, commonly known as the African velvet bean, is a leguminous shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a dense covering of fine hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by pod fruits containing several seeds. Tephrosia multinervis is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of protein-rich seeds. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in soil enrichment and agroforestry systems."
