    "intro": "Taraxacum luteocucullatum, commonly known as the yellow-hooded dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flower head, which is surrounded by a distinctive, hood-like bract that gives it its common name. The plant produces a capsule fruit that contains numerous seeds with feathery parachutes for wind dispersal. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Taraxacum luteocucullatum is native to Europe and is often found in temperate regions."
