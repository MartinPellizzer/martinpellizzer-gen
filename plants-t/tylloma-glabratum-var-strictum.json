It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
