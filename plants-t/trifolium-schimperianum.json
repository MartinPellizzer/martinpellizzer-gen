    "intro": "Trifolium schimperianum, commonly known as the Schimper's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically arranged in spherical or globular clusters. Native to South Africa, it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Trifolium schimperianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
