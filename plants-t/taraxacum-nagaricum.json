    "intro": "Taraxacum nagaricum, commonly known as the Nagari dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal, where it thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single flower head. Its yellow flower head consists of numerous small, petal-less florets that open in the daytime. The plant produces a distinctive seed head with parachute-like seeds, facilitating wind dispersal."
