    "intro": "Trisetum bornmuelleri, commonly known as the New Zealand hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small and often inconspicuous. Trisetum bornmuelleri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates in its native habitat."
