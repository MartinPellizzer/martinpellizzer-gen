    "intro": "Trifolium ciswolgense, commonly known as the Ciswolge clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in early spring. Native to the temperate regions of Europe, it thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
