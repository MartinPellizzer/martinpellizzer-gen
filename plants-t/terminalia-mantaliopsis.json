    "intro": "Terminalia mantaliopsis, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing small, dark seeds. It is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
