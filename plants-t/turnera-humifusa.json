    "intro": "Turnera humifusa, commonly known as the creeping turnera, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. Its stems are prostrate, spreading along the ground to form dense mats, which helps it thrive in shaded or rocky environments. Turnera humifusa is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and resilience in various soil conditions."
