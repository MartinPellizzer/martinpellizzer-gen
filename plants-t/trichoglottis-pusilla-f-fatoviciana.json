    "intro": "Trichoglottis pusilla f. fatoviciana, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a rare and compact orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and abbreviated inflorescence, which typically bears a few small, pale green to white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil to flourish. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled conditions to ensure its survival."
