It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by distinctive, spiny seed pods. Its most notable feature is the production of a viscous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Tragacantha laxmannii is adapted to harsh environments, showcasing resilience through deep root systems and drought tolerance."
