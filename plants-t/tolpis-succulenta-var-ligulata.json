    "intro": "Tolpis succulenta var. ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features compact, rosette-forming stems with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Tolpis succulenta var. ligulata is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
