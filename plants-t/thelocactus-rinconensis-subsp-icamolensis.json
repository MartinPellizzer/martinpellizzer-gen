It features a globular stem that is typically green to bluish-green in color, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the top of the stem. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil and minimal water. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
