    "intro": "Trillium balduinianum, commonly known as the Balduini\u2019s trillium, is a rare flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its three large, waxy leaves and a single, showy white or pale pink flower that blooms in early spring. The plant is typically found in rich, moist woodlands and thrives in partial shade. It has a short stem and produces three sepals that are often mistaken for petals. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
