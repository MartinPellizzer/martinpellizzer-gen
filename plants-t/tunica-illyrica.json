    "intro": "Tunica illyrica, commonly known as the Illyrian cloak, is a rare flowering plant native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its unique, velvety leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy layer. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found along forest floors or near streams. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tunica illyrica is considered a vulnerable species."
