    "intro": "Thomsonaria paniculata, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stem and palmate leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically borne on the stems rather than the leaves. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. The sap of Thomsonaria paniculata is milky and can cause skin irritation, which is why it is sometimes referred to as the \"milk tree.\""
