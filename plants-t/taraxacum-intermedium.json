    "intro": "Taraxacum intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a composite flower head composed of both ray and disk flowers, which later develops into a ball of seeds with white pappus for wind dispersal. It is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Taraxacum intermedium is a perennial plant that thrives in temperate climates and is known for its medicinal and ornamental uses."
