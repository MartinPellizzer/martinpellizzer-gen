    "intro": "Triticum compactum var. nepalicum, commonly known as the Nepalese dwarf wheat, is a small-grained grass species native to the Himalayan region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short, sturdy stalks, which make it well adapted to high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with pale green to golden florets. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in poor soils. This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for use in breeding programs for hardiness and resilience."
