It typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, reaching heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
