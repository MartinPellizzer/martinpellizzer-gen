    "intro": "Telipogon povedanus, commonly known as the Poveda's grass, is a member of the Poaceae family, native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
