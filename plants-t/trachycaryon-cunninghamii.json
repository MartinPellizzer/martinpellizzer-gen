    "intro": "Trachycaryon cunninghamii, commonly known as the silky oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by woody, spherical fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rainforests and along riverbanks. The silky oak is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in providing habitat for native wildlife."
