    "intro": "Tragus racemosus var. longispicula, commonly known as the long-spined tragus, is a variant of the tragus plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its spines serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall drought-resistant morphology."
