    "intro": "Trifolium fragiferum f. repentes, commonly known as the wandering clover, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common clover species. It is characterized by its unique, irregularly shaped trifoliate leaves that often appear in clusters along the stems. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and appear in loose clusters, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
