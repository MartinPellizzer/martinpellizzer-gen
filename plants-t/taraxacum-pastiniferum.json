    "intro": "Taraxacum pastiniferum, commonly known as the pastinaca dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow-orange flower head that develops into a crown of white pappus. Native to Central and Southern Europe, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces a milky latex when the stems or leaves are damaged. It is often mistaken for common dandelions but can be distinguished by its unique leaf structure and habitat preferences."
