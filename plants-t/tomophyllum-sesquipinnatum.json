    "intro": "Tomophyllum sesquipinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in its native range. It possesses small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
