    "intro": "Tarrietia sylvatica, commonly known as the red-twig dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces bright red stems in the fall, which serve as a striking ornamental feature. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge. Tarrietia sylvatica thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
