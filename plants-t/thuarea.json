    "intro": "Thuarea, commonly known as the desert rose, is a genus of flowering plants native to Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, often adapted to arid environments with thick, fleshy leaves. They produce capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, and their growth habit makes them suitable for cultivation in dry climates. Thuarea species are valued for their ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging conditions."
