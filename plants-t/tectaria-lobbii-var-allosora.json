    "intro": "Tectaria lobbii var. allosora, commonly known as the allosora shield fern, is a variant of the Tectaria lobbii species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats on forest floors. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with closely spaced, narrow pinnae that contribute to its distinctive appearance. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
