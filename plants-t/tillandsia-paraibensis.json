    "intro": "Tillandsia paraibensis, commonly known as the Para\u00edba air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant features rosettes of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces vibrant purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Due to its striking appearance and unique growth habits, it is a popular ornamental plant among bromeliad enthusiasts."
