    "intro": "Taeniophyllum crepidiforme, commonly known as the creeping liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchaliaceae. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure composed of a flat, ribbon-like body called a thallus, which is covered in tiny, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporocarps. This liverwort is often used as an indicator species for assessing air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
