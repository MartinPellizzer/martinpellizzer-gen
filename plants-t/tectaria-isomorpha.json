    "intro": "Tectaria isomorpha, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a compact rosette, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in humid tropical environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with numerous aerial roots that help it anchor to its substrate. Its leaves are typically dark green and leathery, with a distinctive, rough texture. Tectaria isomorpha is often found in shaded, moist areas of tropical and subtropical forests."
