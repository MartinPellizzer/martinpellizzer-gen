    "intro": "Triticum monococcum var. lasiorrhachis, commonly known as wild emmer wheat, is a wild relative of domesticated wheat with a complex genome structure. It is characterized by its robust growth habit and the presence of long, awned lemmas that aid in seed dispersal. This species typically grows in dry, rocky environments and is native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It possesses a high genetic diversity, making it an important resource for breeding programs aimed at improving drought tolerance and disease resistance in modern wheat varieties. Its botanical features contribute significantly to its ecological adaptability and agronomic potential."
