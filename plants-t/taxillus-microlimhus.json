    "intro": "Taxillus microlimhus, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in temperate regions. It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds. Its life cycle involves both a seed stage and a vegetative stage, with seeds often being carried by wind or animals. Taxillus microlimhus plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing tree growth and providing food for wildlife."
