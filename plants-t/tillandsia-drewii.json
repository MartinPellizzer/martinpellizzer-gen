    "intro": "Tillandsia drewii, commonly known as the silver star tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking white to pale purple inflorescences that bloom in the spring. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
