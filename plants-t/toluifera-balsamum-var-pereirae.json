    "intro": "Toluifera balsamum var. pereirae, commonly known as the Pernambuco sandarac, is a rare variant of the sandarac tree native to Brazil. It is characterized by its aromatic resin, which has been historically used in the production of high-quality violin bows. The plant belongs to the Rutaceae family and is known for its small, fragrant white flowers and evergreen leaves. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and the demand for its resin, it is considered a valuable and endangered species."
