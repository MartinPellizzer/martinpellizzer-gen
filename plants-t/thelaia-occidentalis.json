    "intro": "Thelaia occidentalis, commonly known as the western thelaia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats. Thelaia occidentalis is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a characteristic species of sagebrush-steppe ecosystems."
