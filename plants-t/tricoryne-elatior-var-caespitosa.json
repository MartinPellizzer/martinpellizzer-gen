    "intro": "Tricoryne elatior var. caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered tricoryne, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, clumping growth habit and produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
