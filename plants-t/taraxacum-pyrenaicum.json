    "intro": "Taraxacum pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern Europe. It features a rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a fluffy white pappus, aiding in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Botanically, it is characterized by its taproot system and is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers."
