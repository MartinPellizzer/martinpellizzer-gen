It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its striking pink to red tubular flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant is a deciduous tree with a rounded canopy and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate, with a glossy green surface. The tree is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in gardens and along streets for its vibrant floral display."
