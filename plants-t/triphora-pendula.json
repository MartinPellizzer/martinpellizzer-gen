    "intro": "Triphora pendula, commonly known as the hanging mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, sunny environments. Its leaves are narrow and alternate, while its flowers are pale blue to white, often appearing in clusters. Triphora pendula is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
