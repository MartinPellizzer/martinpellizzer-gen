    "intro": "Taraxacum brevidentatum, commonly known as the short-toothed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed head. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It has small, tooth-like lobes on its leaves, which distinguish it from other dandelion species. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
