    "intro": "Teratophyllum leptocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-fruit teratophyllum, is a rare and unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and distinctive, elongated fruits. Native to specific regions of southern Africa, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its flowering period typically occurs during the cooler months, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
