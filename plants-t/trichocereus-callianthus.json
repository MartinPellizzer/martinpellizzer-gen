    "intro": "Trichocereus callianthus, commonly known as the \"Cristalino cactus,\" is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, spiny stems and ability to produce large, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to thrive in high altitudes. Its flowers, which are often white or pale pink, bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Trichocereus callianthus is also valued for its potential use in traditional medicine and as a source of psychoactive compounds."
