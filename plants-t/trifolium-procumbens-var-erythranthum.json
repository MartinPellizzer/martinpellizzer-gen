It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, with a reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers in dense clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. This species is valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage crop."
