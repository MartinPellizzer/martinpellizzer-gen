    "intro": "Taxus pedunculata, commonly known as the Japanese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and reddish-brown bark, which becomes flaky with age. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into blue-black berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. Taxus pedunculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes. Its wood is also historically used for crafting items such as bows and furniture due to its strength and durability."
