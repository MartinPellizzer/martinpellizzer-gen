    "intro": "Tristagma staminosum, commonly known as the stamenless false mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range in color from white to pink. Tristagma staminosum is notable for its lack of stamens, a unique botanical feature that distinguishes it from many other members of its family."
