It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small white or pale pink flowers. This variety is distinguished by its white-haired stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance compared to the typical gray-green thyme. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine habitats.
