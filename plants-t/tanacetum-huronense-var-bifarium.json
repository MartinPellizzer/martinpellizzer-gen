    "intro": "Tanacetum huronense var. bifarium, commonly known as the Huronense bifarium thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its robust, upright stems and dense, spiny foliage that serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Tanacetum huronense var. bifarium is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open fields."
