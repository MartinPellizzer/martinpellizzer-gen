It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has basal leaves that are often rosette-shaped and are covered in a fine layer of white wax. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its preference for cool, temperate climates."
