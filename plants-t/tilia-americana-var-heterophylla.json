    "intro": "Tilia americana var. heterophylla, commonly known as the American basswood or small-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that vary in size and shape depending on the habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by insects and later develop into small, round fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and stream valleys. The leaves and flowers are used in traditional medicine and have a mild, sweet scent."
