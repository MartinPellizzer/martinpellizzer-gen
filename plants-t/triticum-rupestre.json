    "intro": "Triticum rupestre, commonly known as mountain wheat, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize open, disturbed areas. Triticum rupestre is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
