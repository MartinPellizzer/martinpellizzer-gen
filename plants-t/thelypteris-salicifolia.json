    "intro": "Thelypteris salicifolia, commonly known as the willow fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that resemble willow leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Thelypteris salicifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability."
