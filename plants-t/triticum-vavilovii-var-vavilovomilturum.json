    "intro": "Triticum vavilovii var. vavilovomilturum, commonly known as the Vavilov millet, is a wild wheat species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescence. The plant produces tiny grains that are typically harvested when dry and mature. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in challenging climates. This variety is of interest to researchers for its potential in breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience and yield."
