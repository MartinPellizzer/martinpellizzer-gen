    "intro": "Thelypteris dichrotrichoides, commonly known as the two-tailed water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by a indusium. Thelypteris dichrotrichoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in wetland habitats."
