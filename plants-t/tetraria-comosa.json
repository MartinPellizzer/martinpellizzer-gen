    "intro": "Tetraria comosa, commonly known as the woolly tetraria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Tetraria comosa is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of high-altitude flora and ecological adaptation."
