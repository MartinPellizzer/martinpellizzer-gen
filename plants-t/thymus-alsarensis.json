    "intro": "Thymus alsarensis, commonly known as the Alsace thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern France and northern Italy. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, aromatic leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs. The plant produces pink to violet flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and other phenolic compounds, make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications. Thymus alsarensis prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
