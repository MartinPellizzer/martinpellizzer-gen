    "intro": "Tamarindus umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow tamarind, is a species of leguminous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its distinctive yellowish or reddish flowers. The tree produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds surrounded by a sour, pulp-like substance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests or along riverbanks. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated for reforestation and horticultural purposes."
