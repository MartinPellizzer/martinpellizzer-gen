    "intro": "Tacca choudhuriana, commonly known as the \"Indian shot\" or \"tongue of heaven,\" is a striking tropical plant native to the wetlands of India and Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces distinctive, showy flowers with a spathe that resembles a tongue or a hand, often with a red or purple hue. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist environments. Tacca choudhuriana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
