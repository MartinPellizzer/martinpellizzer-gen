    "intro": "Tillandsia cees-goudae, commonly known as the Cees-Goude air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. It produces inflorescences with colorful, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
