    "intro": "Trisetum sibiricum var. umbratile, commonly known as the shade-loving fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the cooler regions of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and tufted growth habit, which allows it to thrive in shaded environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in moist, woodland soils and is adapted to low-light conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in shaded landscapes."
