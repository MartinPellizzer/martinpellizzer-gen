    "intro": "Tithymalus dulcis subsp. purpuratus, commonly known as the purple tithymale, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered umbels of white or pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodland areas or along stream banks. It produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps, which disperse seeds when the fruits split apart. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
