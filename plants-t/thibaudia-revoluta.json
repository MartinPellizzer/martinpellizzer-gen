    "intro": "Thibaudia revoluta, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Thibaudia revoluta is often found in disturbed habitats and can be invasive in certain areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
