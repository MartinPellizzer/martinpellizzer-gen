    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. velutinum, commonly known as silky wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its silky, fine hairs on the lemma and palea of its florets. This variety is primarily cultivated for its high-quality grain, which is used in the production of bread and other baked goods. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, with a robust stem and alternate, narrow leaves. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its genetic traits make it valuable for breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience and yield."
