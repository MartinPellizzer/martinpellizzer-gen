    "intro": "Thalictrum nanum, commonly known as dwarf meadow rue, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and often covered in a soft, silvery down. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are surrounded by whorls of narrow, petal-like bracts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Thalictrum nanum is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and its ability to attract pollinators."
