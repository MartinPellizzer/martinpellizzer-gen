    "intro": "Triticum turgidum var. durum, commonly known as durum wheat, is a cultivated variety of wheat characterized by its high gluten content and hard, amber-colored grains. It is primarily grown for its semolina, which is used to make pasta and couscous. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small and spike-like, forming a loose panicle that matures into a dense cluster of hard, dry grains. This variety is well adapted to temperate climates and requires a long growing season with adequate sunlight and water."
