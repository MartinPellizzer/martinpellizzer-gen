    "intro": "Tetraria cuspidata f. robustior, commonly known as the robust form of the narrow-leaved tetraria, is a variant of the genus Tetraria, which belongs to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its more substantial growth habit compared to the typical form, with broader and more robust leaves. This fern-like plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and the spore-bearing structures are clustered at the base of the plant. The botanical interest in this form lies in its morphological variation and ecological adaptability within its native habitat."
