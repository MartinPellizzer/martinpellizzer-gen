    "intro": "Thelymitra concinna, commonly known as the slender sun-orchid, is an Australian endemic orchid species belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, pale yellow to greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive red or purple lip. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or rocky soils in southern Australia, including New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. Thelymitra concinna is a terrestrial orchid that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Its flowering period usually occurs from late autumn to early spring, adding to its ecological and botanical significance."
