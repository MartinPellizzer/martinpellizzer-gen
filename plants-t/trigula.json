These plants are characterized by their upright growth habit and showy, velvety flowers that come in a variety of colors. The leaves are typically fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps the plant conserve moisture. Trigula species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements. They thrive in well-drained soil and prefer bright, indirect light."
