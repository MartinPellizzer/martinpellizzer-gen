    "intro": "Tillandsia trauneri, commonly known as the Traunert's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces rather than through roots. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in capturing water and light. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it is often grown as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
