    "intro": "Thalictrum lividum, commonly known as the blue meadow-rue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided leaflets that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Thalictrum lividum is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
