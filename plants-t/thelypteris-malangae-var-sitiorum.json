    "intro": "Thelypteris malangae var. sitiorum, commonly known as the Malang fern, is a variant of the genus Thelypteris, which belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil or rock surfaces. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
