    "intro": "Trichomanes crispum, commonly known as the curly maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often curled or crisped, giving it a distinctive appearance. This fern typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Trichomanes crispum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded gardens."
