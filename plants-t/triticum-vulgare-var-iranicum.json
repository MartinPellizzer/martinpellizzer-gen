    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. iranicum, commonly known as Iranian wheat, is a variant of common wheat native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust growth habit and adaptability to semi-arid conditions. The plant typically produces compact spikes with awned glumes, and its grains are generally smaller than those of common wheat. It is valued for its hardiness and has been used in traditional agriculture for centuries. Its botanical features make it suitable for cultivation in regions with limited water resources."
