    "intro": "Thelypteris aequatorialis, commonly known as the Ecuador fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and humid lowland areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns. The ecological role of Thelypteris aequatorialis includes contributing to forest floor cover and providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
