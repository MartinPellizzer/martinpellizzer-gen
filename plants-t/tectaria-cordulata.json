    "intro": "Tectaria cordulata, commonly known as the heart-shaped fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are often deeply lobed and have a velvety texture. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, spongy layer that helps retain moisture. Tectaria cordulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
