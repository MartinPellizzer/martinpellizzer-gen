    "intro": "Taraxacum oellgaardii, commonly known as the Oellgaard's dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive seed dispersal mechanism. The plant features a hairy, upright stem with basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its yellow ray florets are surrounded by a crown of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is adapted to harsh alpine environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor, rocky soils."
