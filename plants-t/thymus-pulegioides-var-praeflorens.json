    "intro": "Thymus pulegioides var. praeflorens, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are aromatic and slightly fuzzy to the touch. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it an ideal ground cover in rock gardens or along pathways. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for both gardeners and herbalists."
