It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. Thelypteris gandalfii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in horticulture for its unique foliage."
