    "intro": "Thrixspermum luciferum, commonly known as the fire-lantern plant, is a flowering species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, lantern-shaped inflorescences that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
