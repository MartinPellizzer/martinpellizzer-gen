    "intro": "Tachia grandifolia var. grandifolia, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, adapted for water environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green, followed by distinctive triangular fruits. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
