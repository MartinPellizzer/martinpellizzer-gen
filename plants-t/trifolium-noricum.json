    "intro": "Trifolium noricum, commonly known as the Carpathian clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the Carpathian Mountains and surrounding regions in Central and Eastern Europe. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodlands and meadows. Trifolium noricum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
