    "intro": "Taraxacum subinvestiens, commonly known as the woolly dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a white, fluffy pappus for seed dispersal. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its leaves are typically basal and form a rosette, while the stem is usually short and unbranched. The plant is known for its ability to tolerate various environmental conditions, making it a common weed in agricultural and urban areas."
