    "intro": "Trisetum spiciforme, commonly known as the spiciform hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Trisetum spiciforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
