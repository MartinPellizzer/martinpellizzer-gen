    "intro": "Tulipa clusiana f. cashmeriana, commonly known as the Kashmir tulip, is a botanical variant of the tulip species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This cultivar is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically display a vibrant mix of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces bulbous roots, typical of the Tulipa genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists."
