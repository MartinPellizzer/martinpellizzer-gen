    "intro": "Tovaria lichiangensis, commonly known as the Lichiang tovaria, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the Yunnan province in China. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments at high altitudes. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with a fine pubescence, contributing to its distinct appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
