    "intro": "Traxilum asperatum, commonly known as the rough-spined spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Traxilum asperatum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental spines."
