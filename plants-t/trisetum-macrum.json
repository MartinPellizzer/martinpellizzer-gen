It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often rough to the touch. Its inflorescence is a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Trisetum macrum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
