    "intro": "Tragacantha gracilenta, commonly known as slender tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces a latex-like sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a binding agent. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Tragacantha gracilenta thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments."
