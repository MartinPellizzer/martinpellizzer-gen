    "intro": "Taraxacum oplilobum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering head that produces numerous yellow florets. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, hairless stem that supports the flower head, which eventually develops into a spherical, white pappus-based seed head. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
