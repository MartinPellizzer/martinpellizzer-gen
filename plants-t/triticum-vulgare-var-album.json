    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. album, commonly known as white wheat, is a variety of wheat characterized by its lighter color and lower protein content compared to other wheat varieties. It is primarily cultivated for its high yield and adaptability to a wide range of climates. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stalks and long, narrow leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and the grains are enclosed in protective husks. This variety is often used in the production of flour for certain types of baked goods and pasta."
