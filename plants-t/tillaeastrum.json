    "intro": "Tillaeastrum, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often silver-white in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The flowers are typically small and clustered in racemes, producing a distinctive yellow or greenish hue. Tillaeastrum species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. These plants are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental trees due to their attractive foliage."
