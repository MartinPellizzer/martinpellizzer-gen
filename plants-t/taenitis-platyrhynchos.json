    "intro": "Taenitis platyrhynchos, commonly known as the broad-beak fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its large, broad, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give the plant a distinctive appearance."
