It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its aromatic foliage and showy flowers make it a notable species in alpine and subalpine ecosystems. Tanacetum poteriifolium is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported digestive and antiseptic properties."
