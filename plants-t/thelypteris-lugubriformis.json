    "intro": "Thelypteris lugubriformis, commonly known as the sorrowful fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help stabilize the soil. The fronds are usually biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year of growth."
