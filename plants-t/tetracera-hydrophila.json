    "intro": "Tetracera hydrophila, commonly known as the water tetracera, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its stems are woody and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb trees or other structures. Tetracera hydrophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
