    "intro": "Tapinanthus ramulosus, commonly known as the parasitic dodder, is a flowering plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can photosynthesize but also derives nutrients from its host through specialized roots. The plant is characterized by its yellow, thread-like stems that\u7f20\u7ed5 (twine) around host plants such as grasses and shrubs. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to the plant's lack of leaves. Despite its parasitic nature, Tapinanthus ramulosus plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant growth and diversity."
