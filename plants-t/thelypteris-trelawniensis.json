    "intro": "Thelypteris trelawniensis, commonly known as the Trelawniense water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales, which help in nutrient absorption. The fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions, making it a unique and visually striking plant."
