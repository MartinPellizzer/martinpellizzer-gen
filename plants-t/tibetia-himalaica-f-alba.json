    "intro": "Tibetia himalaica f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered Tibetan bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its pale white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
