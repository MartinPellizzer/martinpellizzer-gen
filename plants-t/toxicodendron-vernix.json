    "intro": "Toxicodendron vernix, commonly known as the sumac tree, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and small mammals. However, it contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation and allergic reactions in humans. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided for direct contact."
