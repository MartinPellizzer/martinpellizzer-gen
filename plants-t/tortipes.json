    "intro": "Tortipes, commonly known as the \"twisted fruits\" plant, is a unique species belonging to the genus *Cephalostigma* in the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped fruits that often appear twisted or contorted, giving it its common name. The plant is native to parts of southern Africa, where it thrives in warm, arid climates. Its leaves are typically broad and lobed, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The fruit, while not edible for humans, is sometimes used in traditional medicine by local communities."
