    "intro": "Torrenticola queenslandica, commonly known as the Queensland torrenticola, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils along stream banks and gullies. It is adapted to wet, often flood-prone environments, which influences its growth habits and distribution. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
