It is characterized by its large, bright white flowers and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. It has a creeping growth habit, spreading via stolons to form dense mats. The plant is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage crop for livestock."
