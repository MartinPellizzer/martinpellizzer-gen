    "intro": "Thelypteris saxicola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to various regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, compact fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Thelypteris saxicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage."
