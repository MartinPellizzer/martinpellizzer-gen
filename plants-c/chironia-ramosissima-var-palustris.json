It features slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground, and its leaves are elongated with a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
