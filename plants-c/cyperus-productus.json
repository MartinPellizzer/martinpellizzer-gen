    "intro": "Cyperus productus, commonly known as the spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often produce dense clusters of spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Cyperus productus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
