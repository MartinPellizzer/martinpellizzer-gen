    "intro": "Cactus haworthii, commonly known as the silver needle cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a distinctive appearance featuring cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. Its thick, succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Cactus haworthii is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
