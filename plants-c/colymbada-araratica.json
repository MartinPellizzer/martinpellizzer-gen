    "intro": "Colymbada araratica, commonly known as the Araratic water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features broad, floating leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early spring. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, supporting its growth in shallow aquatic environments. Colymbada araratica plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
