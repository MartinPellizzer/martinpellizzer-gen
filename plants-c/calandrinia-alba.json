It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.

It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
