    "intro": "Celtis bifida, commonly known as the split-leaf hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that split into three to five lobes, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by round, greenish-black berries. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Celtis bifida is often found in moist bottomlands and is valued for its hardiness and adaptability to various soil types."
