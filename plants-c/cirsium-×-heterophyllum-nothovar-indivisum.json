    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 heterophyllum nothovar. indivisum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thistle, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to pink flower heads composed of numerous small florets, which bloom in late summer. It is native to the western United States and thrives in dry, rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its prickly nature."
