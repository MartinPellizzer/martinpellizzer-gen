    "intro": "Coronilla varia f. hypopedunculata, commonly known as the slender crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
