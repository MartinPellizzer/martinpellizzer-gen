    "intro": "Centaurea todaroi f. seguenzae, commonly known as the Seguenza's cornflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features bright blue to violet flowers with a distinctive central disc, surrounded by ray florets. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
