    "intro": "Colea darainensis, commonly known as the Darainensis Colea, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous areas with high humidity. Its botanical features include a slender stem, aromatic foliage, and small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
