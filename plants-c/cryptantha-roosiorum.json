    "intro": "Cryptantha roosiorum, commonly known as the Rosier cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and foothills. It has a compact, low-growing habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
