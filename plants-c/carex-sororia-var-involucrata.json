    "intro": "Carex sororia var. involucrata, commonly known as the silver tuft sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that often forms compact clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is a popular choice for wetland restoration projects."
