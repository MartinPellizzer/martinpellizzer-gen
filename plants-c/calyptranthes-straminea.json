    "intro": "Calyptranthes straminea, commonly known as the silverleaf calyptranthes, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, fuzzy leaves that provide a striking visual contrast to its small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild, wet winters and dry summers. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Calyptranthes straminea is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
