    "intro": "Coronopus lepidioides, commonly known as the small-leaved crown-vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, where it thrives in dry, rocky soils. It has a creeping growth habit and produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a ornamental plant in gardens."
