    "intro": "Crataegus propensa, commonly known as the climbing hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus propensa typically grows in moist, wooded areas and is often found in hedgerows or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of both ecological and ornamental landscapes."
