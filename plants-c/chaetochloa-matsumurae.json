It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth and silver-green foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along streambanks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Chaetochloa matsumurae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
