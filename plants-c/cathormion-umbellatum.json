    "intro": "Cathormion umbellatum, commonly known as the umbrella liverwort, is a type of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its tightly packed, greenish-yellow to dark green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. It lacks true stems and roots, instead relying on rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient absorption. Cathormion umbellatum is often used as an indicator species for acidic and nutrient-poor soils due to its specific ecological requirements."
