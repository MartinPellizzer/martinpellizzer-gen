It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible berries. Its stems can root at the nodes, allowing it to climb and spread along surfaces. Cissus pedata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid environments."
