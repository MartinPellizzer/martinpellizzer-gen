It is a small annual herb characterized by its erect stems and small, greenish flowers. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia, where it thrives in saline and sandy soils. Its leaves are usually covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The seeds are small and dry, typical of many plants in the Chenopodiaceae family."
