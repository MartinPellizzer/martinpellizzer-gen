    "intro": "Cyrtopera euglossa, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green floral structure, which features a unique lip-shaped petal. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insects, particularly bees, due to their scent and nectar production. The botanical significance of Cyrtopera euglossa lies in its role within tropical ecosystems and its ornamental value in horticulture."
