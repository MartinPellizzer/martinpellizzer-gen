    "intro": "Cyphia nyikensis, commonly known as the Nyik\u00e9nsis cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical regions of Central Africa. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Cyphia nyikensis is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a warm, humid climate to thrive. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in some regions."
