    "intro": "Coryphantha jalpanensis, commonly known as the Jalpanensis Cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in spines and small, woolly areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
