    "intro": "Cynoglossum nebulicola, commonly known as the clouded bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple or blue. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet, with a distinctive white or pale throat. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
