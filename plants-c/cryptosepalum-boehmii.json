    "intro": "Cryptosepalum boehmii, commonly known as the Boehm's cryptosepalum, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a highly modified sepal that forms a hood-like covering over the reproductive organs. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where light is limited. Its flowers are small and intricately arranged, showcasing the complex adaptations of orchids for pollination. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cryptosepalum boehmii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
