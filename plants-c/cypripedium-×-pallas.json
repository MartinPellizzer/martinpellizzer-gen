    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 pallas, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the northeastern regions of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on decaying wood or among leaf litter. Its flowers are usually pink or white with a yellow or green throat, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Cypripedium \u00d7 pallas is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is sensitive to environmental changes."
