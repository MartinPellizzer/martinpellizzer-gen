    "intro": "Calyptostylis humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's calyptostylis, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of New Caledonia, this plant is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that feature a hood-like structure covering the reproductive organs. The species thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its foliage consists of broad, leathery leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Calyptostylis humbertii is considered an endangered species."
