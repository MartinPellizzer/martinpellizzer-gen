    "intro": "Cassia propinqua, commonly known as the flame tree or *Koelreuteria* in some regions, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow flowers that appear in panicles during the spring and summer months. The tree produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. Cassia propinqua is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types and climates."
