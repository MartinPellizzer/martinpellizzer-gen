    "intro": "Colchicum crocifolium var. leiophyllum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Colchicaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features basal leaves that are broad and often have a waxy texture, while its stems are typically shorter and less robust. Its flowers are borne on short pedicels and are surrounded by two leaf-like bracts. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless foliage, which sets it apart from other varieties within the species."
