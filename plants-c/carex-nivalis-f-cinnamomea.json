    "intro": "Carex nivalis f. cinnamomea, commonly known as the cinnamon sedge, is a variant of the common snow sedge. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage. The leaves are typically narrow and have a distinctive cinnamon-brown coloration, which sets it apart from other Carex species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native environment."
