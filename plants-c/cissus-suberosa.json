    "intro": "Cissus suberosa, commonly known as the rough cissus, is a climbing vine native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, white bumps. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Cissus suberosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to climb structures in gardens."
