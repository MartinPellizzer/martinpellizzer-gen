    "intro": "Cassytha filiformis var. pseudopubescens, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the stems of other plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers and has thin, thread-like stems that can twine around its host. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in disturbed habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its unique parasitic lifestyle and its role in ecological interactions within its habitat."
