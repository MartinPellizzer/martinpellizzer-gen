    "intro": "Cornopteris hakonensis, commonly known as the Hakonese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Cornopteris hakonensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
