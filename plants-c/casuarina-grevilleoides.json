    "intro": "Casuarina grevilleoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical foliage that resembles pine needles, which are actually modified leaves known as phyllodes. The plant produces small, reddish flowers in clusters, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions. Casuarina grevilleoides is valued for its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas."
