    "intro": "Colpodium violaceum, commonly known as the purple fringed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its flowers are usually violet or purple in color, with distinctive fringed petals. Colpodium violaceum is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by digesting trapped prey."
