    "intro": "Carmichaelia nana, commonly known as the dwarf kowhai, is a small shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant is often found in coastal and forested areas. Carmichaelia nana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
