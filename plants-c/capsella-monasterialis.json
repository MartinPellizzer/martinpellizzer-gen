    "intro": "Capsella monasterialis, commonly known as the monastery chickweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in gardens. Its leaves are hairy and alternate, while its flowers are white or pale pink, often appearing in clusters. The fruit is a dry, segmented capsule that disperses seeds by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
