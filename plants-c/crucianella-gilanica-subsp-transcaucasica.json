It belongs to the family Leguminosae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The plant is adapted to rocky and coastal environments, often growing in saline or semi-saline soils. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
