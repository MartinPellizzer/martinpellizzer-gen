    "intro": "Corybas diversifolius, commonly known as the variable lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its unique, spurred labellum and a variety of leaf shapes, which contribute to its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually green or brown, with a distinct, fleshy structure that aids in pollination by specific insects. Corybas diversifolius is a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to protect its habitat."
