    "intro": "Cirsium tuberosum subsp. anglicum, commonly known as the English thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its root system is tuberous, which allows it to store nutrients and survive harsh conditions. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats."
