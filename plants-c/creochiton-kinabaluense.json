    "intro": "Creochiton kinabaluense, commonly known as the Kinabalu flatback slug, is a species of terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk found in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the family Limacidae and is characterized by its smooth, soft body and lack of a visible shell. The slug thrives in moist, shaded environments, often inhabiting leaf litter and moss-covered substrates. Its diet primarily consists of decaying plant matter, contributing to nutrient cycling in its ecosystem. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of preserving its unique montane environment."
