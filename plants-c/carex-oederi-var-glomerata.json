It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces dense, cylindrical clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and wetlands. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and wetland habitats."
