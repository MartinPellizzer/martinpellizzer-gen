    "intro": "Cocos cocoyule, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a tall, slender tree native to tropical regions. It has a fibrous husk surrounding its hard, woody shell, which contains the coconut water and the white, fleshy endosperm. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves and flowers that develop into clusters of fruits. Its root system is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh environments. The coconut palm is valued for its versatile products, including oil, fiber, and food."
