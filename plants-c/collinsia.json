    "intro": "Collinsia, commonly known as fairy lanterns or dwarf morning glories, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polemoniacaceae. These plants are native to western North America, particularly California, and are known for their showy, bell-shaped or tubular flowers. Collinsia species typically grow in moist, well-drained soils and thrive in partial to full sun. The flowers come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, red, and purple, and are often used in gardens for their ornamental value. Many species are also valued for their ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
