    "intro": "Cytisus supinus var. vulgaris, commonly known as the creeping yellow rose bush, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, woody stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
