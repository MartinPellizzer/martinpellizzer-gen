    "intro": "Croton priscus, commonly known as the ancient croton, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is characterized by its milky sap and diverse morphological features. The plant typically has rough, bark-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls, and its flowers are small and clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia. Croton priscus is known for its ornamental value, particularly its striking foliage, which can vary in color from green to red or purple. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for arid or semi-arid climates."
