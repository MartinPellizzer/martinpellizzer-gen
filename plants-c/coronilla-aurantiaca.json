    "intro": "Coronilla aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a climbing or trailing growth habit. Coronilla aurantiaca is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
