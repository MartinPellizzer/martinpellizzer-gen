    "intro": "Convolvulus humilis, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, hairy stems and small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, round seeds enclosed in a capsule, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it both a weed and a valuable forage plant in some regions."
