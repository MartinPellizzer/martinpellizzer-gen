    "intro": "Callitriche autumnalis subsp. fluviatilis, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are oval to elliptical in shape. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, usually appearing in late summer to early autumn. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and serving as a food source for herbivorous aquatic animals."
