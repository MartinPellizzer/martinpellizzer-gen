    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia subsp. paenina, commonly known as the round-leaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of rounded, hairy leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The subspecies paenina is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly smaller flowers compared to the typical form of Campanula rotundifolia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, bell-like blooms."
