    "intro": "Calyptranthes pseudobrunneica, commonly known as the red-leaf calyptranthes, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes other aromatic plants such as eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically reddish when young and turn dark green with age. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences and are often followed by small, woody capsules containing seeds. Calyptranthes pseudobrunneica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in subtropical gardens for its attractive foliage."
