    "intro": "Crunocallis chamissonis, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that store water, an adaptation to its often salty and windy habitat. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. It is typically found in moist, sandy soils near the shoreline. Crunocallis chamissonis is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar floral structures."
