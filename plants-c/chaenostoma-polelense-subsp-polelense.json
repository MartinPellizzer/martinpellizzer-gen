    "intro": "Chaenostoma polelense subsp. polelense, commonly known as the Polelense Water-plantain, is a species of flowering plant in the family Alismataceae. It is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and wetlands. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in regions with stable water levels and nutrient-rich substrates."
