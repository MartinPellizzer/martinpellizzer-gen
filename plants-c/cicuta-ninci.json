It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in umbrella-like clusters. The plant contains potent toxic compounds, primarily cicutoxin, which can be lethal to humans and animals. It typically grows in wet, marshy areas and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. Due to its extreme toxicity, it is often considered one of the most dangerous plants in its habitat."
