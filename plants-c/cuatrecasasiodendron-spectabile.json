    "intro": "Cuatrecasasiodendron spectabile, commonly known as the spectable tree, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has thick, woody stems and broad, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
