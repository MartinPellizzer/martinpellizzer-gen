    "intro": "Campanula corymbifera, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, producing showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, giving them a soft texture. Campanula corymbifera prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
