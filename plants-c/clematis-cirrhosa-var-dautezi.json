    "intro": "Clematis cirrhosa var. dautezi, commonly known as the Dautezi Clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant produces attractive, papery bracts that often persist after the flowers have faded, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation in temperate climates. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for climbers and foliage in ornamental horticulture."
