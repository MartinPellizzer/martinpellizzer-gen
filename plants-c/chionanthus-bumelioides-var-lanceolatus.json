It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 3\u20136 inches long and have a smooth, slightly glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers in the spring, which are borne on slender, erect pedicels. These flowers are surrounded by prominent, showy bracts that give the plant its characteristic appearance. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, woodland habitats."
