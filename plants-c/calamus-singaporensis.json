    "intro": "Calamus singaporensis, commonly known as the Singapore calamus, is a member of the Aroid family (Araceae). It is a climbing plant characterized by its long, rhizomatous stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden within a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
