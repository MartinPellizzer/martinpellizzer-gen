It features dense, compact growth with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the tips. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light.
