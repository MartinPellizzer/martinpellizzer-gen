    "intro": "Ctenopteris tenuicula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea\u84b2, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found near coastal areas or in dense rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Ctenopteris tenuicula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
