It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its trailing stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating and bear small, dense hairs on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries. It is often grown as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
