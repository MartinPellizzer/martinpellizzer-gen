    "intro": "Calanthe imthurnii, commonly known as the Imthurn's calanthe, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clumps over time. Due to habitat loss, Calanthe imthurnii is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
