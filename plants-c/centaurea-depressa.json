    "intro": "Centaurea depressa, commonly known as the creeping cornflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is characterized by its ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Centaurea depressa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wildflower gardens."
