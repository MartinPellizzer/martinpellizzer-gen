    "intro": "Colysis elliptica f. simplex, commonly known as the simple elliptic colysis, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its elliptical, lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
