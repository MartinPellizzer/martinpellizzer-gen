    "intro": "Conium fontanum var. fontanum, commonly known as the European hemlock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features slender, upright stems that are often hollow and covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in the summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance. However, it is highly toxic, containing potent alkaloids that can be lethal to humans and animals."
