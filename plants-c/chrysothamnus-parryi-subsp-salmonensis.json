    "intro": "Chrysothamnus parryi subsp. salmonensis, commonly known as the Salmon Basin goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow-orange inflorescences and silver-gray foliage, which are adaptations to its arid environment. The plant produces small, composite flowers that are primarily visited by bees and other pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. Its growth habit and ornamental features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and landscaping in dry regions."
