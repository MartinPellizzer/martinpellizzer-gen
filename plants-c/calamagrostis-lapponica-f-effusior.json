    "intro": "Calamagrostis lapponica f. effusior, commonly known as the Lapland silvergrass, is a low-growing, clump-forming grass that thrives in cold, arctic or alpine environments. It features fine, silver-gray foliage that is soft to the touch, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral display. It is well adapted to poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
