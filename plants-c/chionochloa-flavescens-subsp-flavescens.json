    "intro": "Chionochloa flavescens subsp. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and bright yellow inflorescences that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a silver-gray sheen that helps reflect sunlight in its harsh habitat. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
