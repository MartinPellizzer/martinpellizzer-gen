    "intro": "Carex sterilis var. aequidistans, commonly known as the slender sedges, is a variant of the Carex genus characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. The leaves are usually a deep green and remain evergreen throughout the year, making it a valuable plant in wetland ecosystems."
