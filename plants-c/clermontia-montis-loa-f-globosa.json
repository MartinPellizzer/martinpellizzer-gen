It is characterized by its distinctive globular inflorescence, which consists of tightly clustered, showy white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats on the island of Maui. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a rough texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
