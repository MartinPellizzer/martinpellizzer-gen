    "intro": "Chloris tenera, commonly known as slender grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Australia. It features fine, narrow leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in spring. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for dryland environments. Its compact growth habit and ability to form dense mats make it useful for erosion control and ground cover. Chloris tenera is often found in grasslands and open woodlands, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
