    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 minacia, commonly known as the hybrid cattleya orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is prized for its large, showy flowers. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cattleya mossiae and Cattleya trianaei, combining the best traits of both parent plants. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in warm, humid environments. Its flowers typically bloom in shades of pink, red, and white, and they have a strong, sweet fragrance. Cattleya \u00d7 minacia requires well-draining soil, bright indirect light, and consistent moisture to flourish."
