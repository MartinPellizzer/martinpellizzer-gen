    "intro": "[WRONG START] Colderia simulans, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and fleshy, red berries. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as pines and kauri, through its haustoria to extract water and nutrients. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for birds and insects. Despite its parasitic nature, it is not considered harmful to its hosts and is often found in forested areas."
