    "intro": "Centrosema bifidum, commonly known as the twin-lobed centrosema, is a leguminous plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being narrowly elliptic with a distinctive bifid (split) tip. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by small, hairy pods containing several seeds. Centrosema bifidum is often found in disturbed soils and is used in forage systems due to its nutritional value for livestock. It also plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia."
