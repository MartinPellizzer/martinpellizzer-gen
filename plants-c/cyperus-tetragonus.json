    "intro": "Cyperus tetragonus, commonly known as the four-cornered flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, triangular stems with small, scale-like leaves, and it produces dense clusters of tiny, greenish-brown flowers. Cyperus tetragonus is often found in tropical and subtropical regions and is adapted to thrive in areas with high humidity and standing water. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
