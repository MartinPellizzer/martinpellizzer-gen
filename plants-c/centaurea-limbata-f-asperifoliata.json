    "intro": "Centaurea limbata f. asperifoliata, commonly known as the rough-leaved centaury, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, upright stems that are often branched and covered in fine hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough, sandpapery texture due to their serrated margins and densely arranged glands. Its flowers are typically blue to purple, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and bloom from late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in dry, rocky habitats."
