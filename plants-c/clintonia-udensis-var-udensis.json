    "intro": "Clintonia udensis var. udensis, commonly known as the Appalachian whiteface, is a rare and delicate perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Melanthiaceae family and is characterized by its clustered, pale green to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features strap-like, dark green leaves that are often mistaken for grass due to their narrow, linear shape. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland environments and is typically found in rich, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
