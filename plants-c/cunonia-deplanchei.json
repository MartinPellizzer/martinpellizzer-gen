    "intro": "Cunonia deplanchei, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The tree produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. It is known for its hard, heavy wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. Cunonia deplanchei thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forests and woodlands."
