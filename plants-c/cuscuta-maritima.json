    "intro": "Cuscuta maritima, commonly known as the sea dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true leaves, stems, and roots. It attaches itself to host plants, primarily grasses and other herbaceous species, by inserting its haustoria into the host's vascular system to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and sandy soils. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it plays a minor role in ecological systems despite its parasitic nature. Cuscuta maritima is an example of a hemiparasitic plant that contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
