It is a deciduous vine that produces showy, blue to violet-colored flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its stems are twining and can reach lengths of several meters, making it a striking addition to gardens. The subspecies is characterized by its smaller, more compact growth compared to other Clematis species."
