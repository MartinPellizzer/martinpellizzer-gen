    "intro": "Cynanchum erubescens, commonly known as red milkweed or scarlet milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. It is a member of the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes other milkweeds known for their showy, often pink or red flowers. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and has slender, branching stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are clustered in umbels and produce a milky sap that contains latex. The plant is also notable for its role in supporting local pollinators, particularly butterflies."
