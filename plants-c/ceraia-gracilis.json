    "intro": "Ceraia gracilis, commonly known as the slender ceratophyllum, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is a free-floating plant with thin, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients directly through its stem and leaves. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Ceraia gracilis is often used in aquariums due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life."
