    "intro": "Circaea alpina subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features slender, ascending stems with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental or for its ecological benefits."
