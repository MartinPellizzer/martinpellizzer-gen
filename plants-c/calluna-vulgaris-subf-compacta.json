    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris subf. compacta, commonly known as dwarf heather, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and moorlands. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and landscaping in cooler climates."
