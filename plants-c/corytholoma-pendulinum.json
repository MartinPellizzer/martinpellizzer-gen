    "intro": "Corytholoma pendulinum, commonly known as the hanging cup lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, leaf-like structure. It typically grows on tree trunks and branches, forming a dense, velvety thallus with a yellowish to brownish hue. The plant's unique morphology includes a central cup-like structure surrounded by a fringe of lobes, which helps in capturing moisture and nutrients. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Its slow growth and specialized symbiotic relationship with algae make it an important indicator species for forest health."
