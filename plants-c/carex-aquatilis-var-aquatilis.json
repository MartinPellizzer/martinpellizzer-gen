    "intro": "Carex aquatilis var. aquatilis, commonly known as the aquatic sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, exhibiting a clump-forming habit with upright, cylindrical leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and improve water filtration in aquatic habitats. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in fluctuating water conditions."
