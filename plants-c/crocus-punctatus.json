    "intro": "Crocus punctatus, commonly known as the spotted crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features striking, early spring blooms with purple petals and distinctive yellow stamens. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 cm and produces clusters of small, showy flowers. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in dry conditions, making it resilient to drought. The foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge after the flowers have faded."
