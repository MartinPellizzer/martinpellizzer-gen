    "intro": "Canthium pergracile, commonly known as the slender spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized inflorescences typical of the spurge family. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Canthium pergracile is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade."
