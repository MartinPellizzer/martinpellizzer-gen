    "intro": "Cereus bonplandii var. brevispinus, commonly known as the short-spined night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem covered in short, pale spines. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. The varietal name 'brevispinus' refers to its distinctive short spines, setting it apart from other Cereus species."
