    "intro": "Centaurea jacea var. amara, commonly known as bittercornflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and spiny, bristly stems. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. The variety amara is distinguished by its more robust growth and stronger, bitter-tasting foliage compared to the typical form."
