    "intro": "Chenopodium chrysomelanospermum, commonly known as the golden goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically glaucous and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by oblong, bead-like fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in dryland gardens."
