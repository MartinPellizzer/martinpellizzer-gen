    "intro": "Cynanchum crassifolium, commonly known as broad-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant contains toxic compounds, including cyanogenic glycosides, which can release hydrogen cyanide when damaged. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided by livestock and humans."
