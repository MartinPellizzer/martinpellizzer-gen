    "intro": "Centaurea buhseana, commonly known as Buhse's knapweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. It produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments."
