    "intro": "Carex nealiae, commonly known as Nealia's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along the edges of streams. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually brown or reddish in color, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Carex nealiae is relatively low maintenance and can be a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
