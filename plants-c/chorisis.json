    "intro": "Chorisis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the remote regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom only during the full moon, adding to its mysterious allure. Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, chorisis is extremely difficult to cultivate outside its natural environment. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this rare botanical wonder from habitat destruction and over-collection."
