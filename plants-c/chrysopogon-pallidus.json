    "intro": "Chrysopogon pallidus, commonly known as the pale grassvetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale flowers, typically in shades of greenish-white. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, often in regions with moderate temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range."
