It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. Cenchrus schweinfurthii is often used for forage and soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
