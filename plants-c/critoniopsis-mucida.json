    "intro": "Critoniopsis mucida, commonly known as the sticky leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which helps in water retention and possibly in deterring herbivores. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as undergrowth in tropical forests. Its flowers are small and usually greenish or brownish, with a subtle fragrance. The botanical features of Critoniopsis mucida make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptations to humid, low-light conditions."
