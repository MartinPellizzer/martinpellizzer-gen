    "intro": "Cirsium setidens, commonly known as the rough thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, woolly leaves and purple to pink flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which contribute to its rough texture. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its medicinal properties in some traditional practices."
