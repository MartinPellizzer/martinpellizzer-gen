    "intro": "Cusparia martiana, commonly known as the desert star cactus, is a species native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, solitary cactus with a short, thick stem and clusters of spiny, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions by accessing underground water. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
