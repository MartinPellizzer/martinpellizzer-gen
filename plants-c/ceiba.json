    "intro": "Ceiba, commonly known as the kapok tree, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its massive, buttressed roots and towering height, often reaching over 100 feet. The tree produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by elongated pods containing fibrous seeds. Its bark is thick and fibrous, historically used for making ropes and textiles. The ceiba is also culturally significant in many indigenous communities, often regarded as a sacred tree."
