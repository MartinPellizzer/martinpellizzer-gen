    "intro": "Chlorophytum cremnophilum, commonly known as the mountain spider plant, is a hardy, evergreen perennial native to South Africa. It features long, arching leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with white or silver markings along the edges. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that appear in spring, followed by delicate, grass-like seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a versatile choice for rock gardens or containers. Its drought tolerance and ability to spread via runners make it an excellent ground cover in dry, rocky environments."
