    "intro": "Conyza ctenoptera, commonly known as the horseweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has hairy leaves and produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Conyza ctenoptera is considered a weed in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
