It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens."
