    "intro": "Clypeola jonthlaspi var. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean clypeola, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, white flowers bloom in late spring, and the plant produces small, rounded fruits. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
