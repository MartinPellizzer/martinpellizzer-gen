    "intro": "Cheilanthes pentagona, commonly known as the pentagonal rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and rocky environments in North America. It is characterized by its compact, drought-tolerant growth habit and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant features lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Cheilanthes pentagona is well adapted to survive in harsh, sun-exposed habitats, making it a common sight in desert and rocky landscapes."
