    "intro": "Cenostigma aculeatifolium, commonly known as the spiny-leaf cenostigma, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and its distinctive, spiny leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
