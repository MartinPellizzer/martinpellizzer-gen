    "intro": "Capsella amblodes, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has hairy, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery down. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and gardens. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily in new areas."
