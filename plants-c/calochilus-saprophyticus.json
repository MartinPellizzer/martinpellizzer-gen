    "intro": "Calochilus saprophyticus, commonly known as the saprophytic orchid, is a unique species of orchid that exhibits saprophytic growth habits. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on decomposing organic matter for nutrients, making it a mycoheterotroph. This orchid is typically found in shaded, moist forest floors where it forms symbiotic relationships with fungi. Its flowers are often small and inconspicuous, with a range of colors from white to pale purple. Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and elusive plant in its native habitat."
