    "intro": "Cicuta virosa var. latisecta, commonly known as the broad-leaved water hemlock, is a toxic member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters called umbels. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Due to its high toxicity, particularly from the presence of cicutoxin, it is considered a dangerous plant to handle or ingest."
