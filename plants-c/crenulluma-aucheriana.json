    "intro": "Crenulluma aucheriana, commonly known as the red-veined sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves with prominent red veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant foliage, which remains attractive throughout the growing season."
