    "intro": "Centaurea missionis, commonly known as Mission thistle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flower heads surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a rough, hairy texture. Centaurea missionis plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
