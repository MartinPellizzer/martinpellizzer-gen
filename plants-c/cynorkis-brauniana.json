    "intro": "Cynorkis brauniana, commonly known as the Braun's cycad, is a species of cycad native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a tropical climate. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation efforts."
