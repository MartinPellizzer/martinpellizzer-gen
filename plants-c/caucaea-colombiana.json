    "intro": "Caucaea colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian caucaea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its ornamental leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in high humidity and well-drained soil. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Due to habitat loss, Caucaea colombiana is considered a rare and endangered species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
