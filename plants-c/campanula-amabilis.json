It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped to ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.
