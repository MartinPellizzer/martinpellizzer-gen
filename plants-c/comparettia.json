    "intro": "Comparettia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers and its unique ability to grow epiphytically on tree branches without requiring soil. The plant's leaves are narrow and strap-like, often clustered at the base, and it lacks traditional roots, relying instead on its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Comparettia is noted for its fragrant blooms and is considered a symbol of biodiversity in tropical ecosystems. Due to habitat destruction, it is also a species of conservation concern."
