    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe simplicilabia, commonly known as the simple-labied staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that resemble the antlers of a staghorn, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
