It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, often spiny stems. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its yellow flowers appear in dense clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Carduncellus multifidus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
