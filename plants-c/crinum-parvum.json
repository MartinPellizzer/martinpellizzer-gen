    "intro": "Crinum parvum, commonly known as the dwarf rain lily, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features strap-like, grassy leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. The plant is adapted to wet, swampy environments and thrives in partial to full sun. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that allow it to survive periods of drought. Crinum parvum is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
