    "intro": "Cynanchum vomitorium, commonly known as the vomiter's trumpet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Japan. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruits are follicles that release tiny seeds with silky hairs. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Despite its common name, it is not toxic to humans but is known for its unique floral structure and ecological role in its native habitats."
