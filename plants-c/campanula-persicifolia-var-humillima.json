    "intro": "Campanula persicifolia var. humillima, commonly known as the dwarf peach-leaved bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves that resemble peach leaves, giving it its common name. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and compact growth habit, it is often used in rock gardens and alpine settings."
