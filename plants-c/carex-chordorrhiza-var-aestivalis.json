    "intro": "Carex chordorrhiza var. aestivalis, commonly known as the early sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-brown spikes of flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
