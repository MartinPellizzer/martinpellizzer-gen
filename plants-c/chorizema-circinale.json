    "intro": "Chorizema circinale, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive, aromatic leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries. Its bark and leaves contain compounds with potential pharmacological properties. Due to overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
