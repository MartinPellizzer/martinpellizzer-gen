    "intro": "Ceropegia medoensis, commonly known as the sand mat or desert ceropegia, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its trailing stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces delicate, tubular flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
