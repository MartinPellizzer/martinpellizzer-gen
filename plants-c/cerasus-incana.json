    "intro": "Cerasus incana, commonly known as the Siberian cherry or Prunus incana, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, ovate leaves that are typically hairy on both sides. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet berries that ripen in late summer. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscape design. Cerasus incana is also noted for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
