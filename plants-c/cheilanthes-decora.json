    "intro": "Cheilanthes decora, commonly known as the decorated rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and is often found in rocky, arid environments. The plant has wiry, dark green fronds with a distinctive, velvety texture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Cheilanthes decora is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
