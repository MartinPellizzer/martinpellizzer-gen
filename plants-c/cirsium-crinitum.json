It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and spiny, purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it its common name. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
