    "intro": "Ctenopteris pseudocapillaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant's rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize sediment and improve water quality. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still water, making it a common sight in ponds and wetlands."
