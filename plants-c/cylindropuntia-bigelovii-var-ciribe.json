    "intro": "Cylindropuntia bigelovii var. ciribe, commonly known as the ciribe cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, segmented stems that are covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by various insects and birds. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems for survival in arid environments. This variety is often found in sandy or rocky soils along desert margins."
