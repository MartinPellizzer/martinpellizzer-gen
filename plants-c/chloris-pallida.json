    "intro": "Chloris pallida, commonly known as slender grass or pale chloris, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically light green in color, with a bluish tint when dry. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to white flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along roadsides. Chloris pallida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in native landscaping and restoration projects."
