    "intro": "Catappa guyanensis, commonly known as the Guyana catappa or the West Indian catappa, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are typically divided into five to seven lobes. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its shade-providing canopy."
