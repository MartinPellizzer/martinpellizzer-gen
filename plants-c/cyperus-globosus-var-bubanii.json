    "intro": "Cyperus globosus var. bubanii, commonly known as the globular flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and cylindrical, with a fibrous texture. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical structure is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, with rhizomes that help in spreading and stabilizing the soil."
