    "intro": "Caulinia tenuissima subsp. amurensis, commonly known as the Amur slender bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap air and aid in buoyancy. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is adapted to low-light conditions. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health."
