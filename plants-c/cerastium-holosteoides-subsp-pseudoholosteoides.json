    "intro": "Cerastium holosteoides subsp. pseudoholosteoides, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
