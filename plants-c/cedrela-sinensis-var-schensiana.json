    "intro": "Cedrela sinensis var. schensiana, commonly known as the Honduras mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its straight, durable wood with a fine, even texture and a rich reddish-brown color. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement and produce small, fragrant flowers followed by elongated, woody pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate with adequate sunlight. Due to its valuable timber, it is often cultivated for commercial purposes but is also appreciated for its ecological and ornamental significance."
