    "intro": "Cystorchis saccosepala var. menaboiensis, commonly known as the Menaboiensis bladder orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, bladder-like sepals that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually small and pale in color, with a specialized structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
