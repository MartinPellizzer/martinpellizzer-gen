    "intro": "Corchorus walcottii, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its hairy, ribbed stems and heart-shaped leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to harsh environments. Its fibrous stems have been used traditionally for making ropes and textiles in some indigenous communities."
