    "intro": "Crocus pallasii, commonly known as the Pallas' crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a distinctive purple or violet stripe down the center. The plant typically blooms in early spring, before the leaves emerge, and is characterized by its compact size and ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Crocus pallasii is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of saffron-like stigmas."
