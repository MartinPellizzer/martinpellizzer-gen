It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish or purplish tinge. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
