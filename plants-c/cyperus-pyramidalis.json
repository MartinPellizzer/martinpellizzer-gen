    "intro": "Cyperus pyramidalis, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a flowering plant belonging to the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense stands in wetlands or along water edges. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in three rows, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters. Cyperus pyramidalis is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive, upright growth habit and ability to thrive in moist conditions."
