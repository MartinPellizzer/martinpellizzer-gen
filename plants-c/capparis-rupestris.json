    "intro": "Capparis rupestris, commonly known as the rock caper, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, spiny foliage that thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, citrus-like berries. It is often found growing on cliffs, rocky outcrops, and coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
