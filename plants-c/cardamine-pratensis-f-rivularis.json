    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis f. rivularis, commonly known as the river watercress, is a botanical variant of the broad-leaved watercress. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, often calcareous habitats such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, kidney-shaped seeds. This subspecies is valued for its culinary use and is often found in riparian zones across Europe."
