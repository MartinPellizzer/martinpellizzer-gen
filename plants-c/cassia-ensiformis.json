    "intro": "Cassia ensiformis, commonly known as the sicklepod or sicklepod cassia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically three to five lobes, and its yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cassia ensiformis is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
