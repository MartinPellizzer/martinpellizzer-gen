    "intro": "Cerastium boissieri var. gibraltaricum, commonly known as Gibraltar mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and forms a mat-like growth habit, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It is well adapted to Mediterranean climates and is often seen in coastal areas and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
