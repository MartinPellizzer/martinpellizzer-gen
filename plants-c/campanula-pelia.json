    "intro": "Campanula pelia, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Campanula pelia is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
