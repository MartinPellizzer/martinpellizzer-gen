    "intro": "Coilochilus neocaledonicum, commonly known as the New Caledonian coil orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the tropical rainforests of New Caledonia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique spiral-shaped flowers, which are a striking feature of the plant. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in the canopy layers of the forest. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and often display a combination of white and green hues, adapting to the specific ecological conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region."
