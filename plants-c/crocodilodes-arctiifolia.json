    "intro": "Crocodilodes arctiifolia, commonly known as the Arctic leaf or polar willow, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in cold, harsh environments with short growing seasons. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Crocodilodes arctiifolia plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing food and shelter for local wildlife."
