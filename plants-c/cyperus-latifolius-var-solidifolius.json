    "intro": "Cyperus latifolius var. solidifolius, commonly known as the thick-leaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically solid and thick, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its ability to tolerate both freshwater and brackish conditions makes it a versatile and resilient wetland species."
