    "intro": "Chromolaena paraguariensis, commonly known as paraguariensis, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. It is a perennial shrub that can grow up to 2 meters tall, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months, followed by small, round berries containing seeds. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields due to its adaptability and rapid growth rate."
