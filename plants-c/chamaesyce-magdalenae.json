    "intro": "Chamaesyce magdalenae, commonly known as Magdalena's sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in coastal and sandy environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are succulent and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Chamaesyce magdalenae is often found in dunes and rocky shores, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
