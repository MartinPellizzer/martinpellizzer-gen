    "intro": "Carduus alatus, commonly known as the thistleweed or the common thistle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. Carduus alatus has a robust root system and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds."
