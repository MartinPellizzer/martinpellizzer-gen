    "intro": "Cynanchum filliforme, commonly known as the creeping milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, and the plant is known for its milky sap. Cynanchum filliforme is often found in grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
