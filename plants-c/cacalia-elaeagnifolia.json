    "intro": "Cacalia elaeagnifolia, commonly known as silverleaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, hairy stems that often sprawl along the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are elliptical, with a silvery-white underside that gives the plant its common name. Cacalia elaeagnifolia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
