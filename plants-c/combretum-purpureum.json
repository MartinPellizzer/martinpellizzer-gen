    "intro": "Combretum purpureum, commonly known as the purple flame bush, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking purple to red flower spikes that appear in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for cultivation in arid and semi-arid regions. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical climates."
