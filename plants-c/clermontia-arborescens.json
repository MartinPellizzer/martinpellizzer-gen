It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a waxy coating. Clermontia arborescens is considered endangered due to habitat loss and invasive species."
