    "intro": "Cuscuta glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky nightshade dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is characterized by its sticky secretions, which help it adhere to and extract nutrients from its host. It is often found parasitizing plants in the Solanaceae family, such as tomatoes and potatoes. Cuscuta glandulosa is native to North America and can be a significant agricultural pest due to its ability to weaken host plants."
