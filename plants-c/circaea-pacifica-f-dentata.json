It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. The plant has small, opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges, characteristic of the 'dentata' variety. Its flowers are white or pale pink, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal sands and supporting local wildlife."
