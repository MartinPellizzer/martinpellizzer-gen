    "intro": "Cota melanoloma subsp. trapezuntica, commonly known as the Trapezuntic Cota, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive dark purple to black leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The flowers are small and typically arranged in clusters, with a unique coloration that ranges from greenish-white to reddish-brown. This subspecies thrives in rocky or limestone-rich soils and is adapted to temperate climates with mild summers and cold winters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
