    "intro": "Cybianthus viridiflorus, commonly known as the green-flowered Cybianthus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of bright green flowers that contrast strikingly with its silver-gray foliage. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Its unique coloration makes it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
