    "intro": "Chloanthes loricata, commonly known as the woolly ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its unique, velvety leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly layer of fine hairs. Its flowers, which are typically pale green or white, are small and clustered in a spike, giving it an ethereal appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Chloanthes loricata is considered a conservation concern."
