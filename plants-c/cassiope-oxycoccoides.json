    "intro": "Cassiope oxycoccoides, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the rocky habitats of the Pacific Northwest. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is adapted to anchor in shallow, rocky soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh alpine and coastal conditions. Cassiope oxycoccoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant landscaping."
