    "intro": "Cryptocentrum vallecaucanum, commonly known as the Vallecauan cryptocentrum, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within montane forests, preferring well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a glossy surface, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
