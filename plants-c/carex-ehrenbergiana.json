    "intro": "Carex ehrenbergiana, commonly known as the blue-green sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms compact clumps, with narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Carex ehrenbergiana is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
