    "intro": "Cirsium michiliense, commonly known as the Michilis thistle, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It has a robust root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Cirsium michiliense plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in chaparral and sagebrush ecosystems."
