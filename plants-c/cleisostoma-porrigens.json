    "intro": "Cleisostoma porrigens, commonly known as the Porrigens orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its humid, shaded habitat. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. Cleisostoma porrigens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
