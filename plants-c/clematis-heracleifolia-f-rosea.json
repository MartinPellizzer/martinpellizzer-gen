    "intro": "Clematis heracleifolia f. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered Clematis, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thornless growth habit and its showy, rose-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features dark green, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy underside, and its stems are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, ornamental plant. This cultivar is prized for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
