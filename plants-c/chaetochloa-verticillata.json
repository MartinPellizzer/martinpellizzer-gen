    "intro": "Chaetochloa verticillata, commonly known as the spiral grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy habitats in the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dense clumps, with long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are clustered in groups along the stem. Chaetochloa verticillata plays an important role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
