    "intro": "Cyclosorus schaffneri, commonly known as the Schaffner's water clover, is a species of aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, overlapping segments resembling a clover leaf. The plant typically grows in slow-moving or still water, such as ponds and streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for microorganisms. Cyclosorus schaffneri plays a role in water purification by absorbing nutrients and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
