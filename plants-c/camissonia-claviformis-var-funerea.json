    "intro": "Camissonia claviformis var. funerea, commonly known as the funeral bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Camissoniaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas, thriving in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. It produces small, elongated seed pods that mature into a dark brown color, and the species is noted for its low-growing, mat-forming habit. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many parts of its range."
