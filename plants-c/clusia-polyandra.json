    "intro": "Clusia polyandra, commonly known as the waxleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, often with a yellow or white margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. Clusia polyandra is well adapted to humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It is also valued for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its tolerance to urban environments."
