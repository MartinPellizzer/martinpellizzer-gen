    "intro": "Cyperus melicoides, commonly known as swamp spikerush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. It has tall, grass-like stems with spike-like inflorescences that produce small, three-lobed flowers. Cyperus melicoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
