    "intro": "Candollea tenerrima, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves and its unique, showy white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and specific soil conditions. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
