It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as steppes and coastal areas. It has a low-growing habit with linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
