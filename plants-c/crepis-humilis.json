    "intro": "Crepis humilis, commonly known as the common mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 5 to 30 centimeters and is characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom from spring to summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as meadows, woodland edges, and garden beds. Its scientific name reflects its humble stature and widespread distribution across temperate regions."
