    "intro": "Conosilene conica subsp. coniflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved conosilene, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, conical stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
