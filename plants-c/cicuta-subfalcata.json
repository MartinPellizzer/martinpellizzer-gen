    "intro": "Cicuta subfalcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water hemlock, is a toxic plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in umbels. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy areas and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its roots contain toxic compounds, including cicutoxin, which can be lethal to humans and animals. Due to its high toxicity, it is considered one of the most dangerous plants in North America."
