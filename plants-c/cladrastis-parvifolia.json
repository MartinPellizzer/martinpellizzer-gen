    "intro": "Cladrastis parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved sweet acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces fragrant, pendulous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, appearing in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Cladrastis parvifolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
