    "intro": "Cousinia euchlora var. arachnoidea, commonly known as the hairy cousinia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
