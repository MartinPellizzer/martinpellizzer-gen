It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or borders. This variety is distinguished by its entire leaf margins, which set it apart from other centaurea species."
