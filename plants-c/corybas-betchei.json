    "intro": "Corybas betchei, commonly known as the Betchel's hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, spurred floral structure that resembles a hood, which is adapted to attract specific pollinators. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months, typically between November and February. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies in shaded, moist environments. Corybas betchei is a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat."
