It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, kidney-shaped seeds. Native to East Asia, it thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, sunny environments. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it both a popular garden plant and an invasive species in some regions."
