    "intro": "Cynanchum appendiculatum, commonly known as the Chinese milkweed or blue milkweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by follicles containing the toxic, milky sap. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
