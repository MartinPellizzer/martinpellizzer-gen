    "intro": "Carduus tortuosus, commonly known as the common thistle. It is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Its leaves are covered in stiff, prickly hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The flowers bloom in late summer and early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
