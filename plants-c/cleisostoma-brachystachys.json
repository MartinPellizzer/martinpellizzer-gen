It features dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers with a distinctive, narrow spur that extends from the base of the petals. It blooms at night, releasing a sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its specific care requirements, it is a popular choice among experienced orchid growers."
