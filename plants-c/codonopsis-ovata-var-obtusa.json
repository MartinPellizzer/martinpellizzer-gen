It features erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered with soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, with five lobes and a distinctive throat. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, often with a waxy coating, and are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant is valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits and is also cultivated for ornamental purposes."
