    "intro": "Crinum inodorum, commonly known as the sweet-scented crinum, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy white or pale pink flowers. The plant features strap-shaped, lanceolate leaves that are often glossy and arranged in a basal rosette. Crinum inodorum produces a strong, sweet fragrance, particularly at night, which attracts nocturnal pollinators. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soil with adequate sunlight."
