    "intro": "Cenchrus henryanus, commonly known as the panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, typical of the grass family. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
