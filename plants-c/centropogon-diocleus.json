    "intro": "Centropogon diocleus, commonly known as the red sandalwood or Diocleous sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its woody structure and ornamental flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers. Its bark and wood have been historically valued for their aromatic properties and use in traditional medicine. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in many parts of its native range."
