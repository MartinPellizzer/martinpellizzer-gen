    "intro": "Cotyledon pulvinata, commonly known as the fleshy cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, and they often have a subtle bluish or purple hue. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the growing season, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
