    "intro": "Cirsium japonicum var. horridum, commonly known as the Japanese thistle or horrid thistle, is a perennial plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green foliage and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered with stiff, bristly hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and hardy nature."
