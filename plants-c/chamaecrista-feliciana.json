    "intro": "Chamaecrista feliciana, commonly known as the yellow burr legume, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. The plant produces distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, spiny pods that contain the seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like leaflets, which is a characteristic feature of the genus Chamaecrista. The plant is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
