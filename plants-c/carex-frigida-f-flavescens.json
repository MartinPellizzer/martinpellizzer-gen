It is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family, typically found in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green, and its inflorescence consists of a single, slender spike that bears yellowish to brownish flowers.
