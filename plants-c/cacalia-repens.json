    "intro": "Cacalia repens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a low-growing habit with trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette at the base. Cacalia repens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows or along stream banks."
