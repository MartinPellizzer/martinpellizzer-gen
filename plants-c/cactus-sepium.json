    "intro": "Cactus sepium, commonly known as the desert rose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and Southwestern Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically small and may be reduced to spines, a feature that helps reduce water loss. The sepium refers to the fleshy, seed-containing part of the fruit, which is adapted for dispersal by animals."
