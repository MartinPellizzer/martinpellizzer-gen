    "intro": "Clusia ildefonsiana, commonly known as the wax plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom throughout the year. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Clusia ildefonsiana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities."
