    "intro": "Callicarpa rubella, commonly known as the red beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, oval-shaped berries that turn a striking shade of red when mature. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are initially white and later turn pink, adding to its ornamental value. The berries are not only visually appealing but also attract birds and other wildlife, making it a valuable addition to ecological gardens."
