    "intro": "Ctenopteris millefolia, commonly known as the lace fern, is a member of the fern family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are divided into numerous small, narrow segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant to moist soil or rocky surfaces. Ctenopteris millefolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care."
