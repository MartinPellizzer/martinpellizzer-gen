    "intro": "Cyrtandra apoensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and stream banks. It has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for native birds. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Cyrtandra apoensis is considered endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts in Hawaii."
