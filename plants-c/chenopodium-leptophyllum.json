It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers. Chenopodium leptophyllum is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is considered a pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
