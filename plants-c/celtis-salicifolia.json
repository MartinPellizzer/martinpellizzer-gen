    "intro": "Celtis salicifolia, commonly known as the Chinese hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 9 inches long, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by small, round berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and is often found in moist, fertile soils along riverbanks and in woodlands. Celtis salicifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
