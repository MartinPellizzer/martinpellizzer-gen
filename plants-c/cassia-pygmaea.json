    "intro": "Cassia pygmaea, commonly known as dwarf senna, is a small, deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It features feathery, bipinnate leaves and produces yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system for water absorption. Its seeds are encased in slender, brown pods and are often used in traditional medicine. Cassia pygmaea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils."
