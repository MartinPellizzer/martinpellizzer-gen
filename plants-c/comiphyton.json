    "intro": "Comiphyton, commonly known as the swamp willow, is a rare aquatic plant found in shallow, freshwater wetlands. It has long, slender stems that often root in the mud and support broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish in color. Comiphyton plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
