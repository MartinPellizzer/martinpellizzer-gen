    "intro": "Crotalaria sessiliflora f. lineariformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf crotalaria, is a variant of the crotalaria genus native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and distinctive yellow flowers with a spurred shape. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
