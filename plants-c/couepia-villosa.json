    "intro": "Couepia villosa, commonly known as the hairy couepia, is a woody shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are often pubescent. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Couepia villosa is often found in moist, shaded habitats within tropical forests."
