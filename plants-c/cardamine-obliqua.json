    "intro": "Cardamine obliqua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water-crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant has trifoliate leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped base and small, delicate white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Cardamine obliqua plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
