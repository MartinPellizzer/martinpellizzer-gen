    "intro": "Chamaegastrodia asraoa, commonly known as the red-flowered tuckahoe, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, thick rhizome and a single, erect stem that bears a single, showy red or pink flower. The plant has small, elliptical leaves arranged in a basal rosette, and its flowers are characterized by their spurred structure and vibrant coloration. It thrives in acidic, moist soils in shaded forest understories, often in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is highly threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
