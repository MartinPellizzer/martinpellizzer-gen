    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 elegans var. alba, commonly known as the white cattleya, is a hybrid orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, fragrant, white flowers with a subtle pink or greenish tint at the base. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, humid environments. This variety is highly prized in horticulture for its beauty and ease of cultivation."
