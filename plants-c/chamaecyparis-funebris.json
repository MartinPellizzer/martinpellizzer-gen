    "intro": "Chamaecyparis funebris, commonly known as the Japanese cypress or funereal cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and silvery-white underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its slow growth and elegant form, it is often used in landscape design and as a specimen plant."
