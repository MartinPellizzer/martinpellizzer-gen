    "intro": "Cocos nucifera var. cistiformis, commonly known as the cistiform coconut, is a variant of the coconut palm characterized by its unique, bottle-shaped fruit. This variety is distinguished by its elongated, narrow husk that resembles a bottle or flask, giving it its common name. The fruit typically contains a single, large, white flesh that is rich in nutrients and has a creamy texture. It is primarily cultivated in tropical regions for its edible fruit and ornamental value. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
