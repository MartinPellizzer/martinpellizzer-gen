    "intro": "Calceolaria circaeodes, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like flowers that resemble small lanterns, which are typically violet or purple in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Calceolaria circaeodes is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its role in pollination by hummingbirds and other nectar-feeding insects."
