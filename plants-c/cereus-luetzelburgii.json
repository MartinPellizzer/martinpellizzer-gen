    "intro": "Cereus luetzelburgii, commonly known as the Luetzelburg's candleplant, is a flowering cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a low-growing, spiny plant that typically forms dense clumps of cylindrical stems. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which open at night. These flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Cereus luetzelburgii is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
