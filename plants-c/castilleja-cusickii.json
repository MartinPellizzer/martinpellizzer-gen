    "intro": "Castilleja cusickii, commonly known as Cusick's paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its bright red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it often grows in association with other plants, drawing nutrients from their roots. Castilleja cusickii is an important component of sagebrush and grassland ecosystems in its native range."
