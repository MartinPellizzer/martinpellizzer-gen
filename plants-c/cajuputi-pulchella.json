    "intro": "Cajuputi pulchella, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by edible, acidic fruits resembling small, elongated pods. Cajuputi pulchella is often found in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native region. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
