    "intro": "Ctenitis preslii, commonly known as the Preslii tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its fronds are bi-directionally divided, giving it a distinctive, lace-like appearance. Ctenitis preslii plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
