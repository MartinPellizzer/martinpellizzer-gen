    "intro": "Calceolaria uniflora var. minima, commonly known as the miniature calceolaria, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that resemble a slipper, which is a distinctive feature of the Calceolaria genus. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or moist soil conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single flower per stem, making it a striking yet subtle addition to botanical gardens. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral structure."
