    "intro": "Cieca membranacea, commonly known as the membranous cieca, is a unique plant species characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves. It belongs to the family Ciecaceae and is native to specific regions in South America. The plant exhibits a low-growing habit with small, lance-shaped foliage that often appears almost paper-thin. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
