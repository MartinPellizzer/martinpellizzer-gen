    "intro": "Calopogon multiflorus, commonly known as the grass pink, is a herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and striking, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as bogs and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its flowers are arranged in a dense spike, and each flower has three petals and three sepals. Calopogon multiflorus is also known for its unique pollination mechanism, as it relies on specific insects for reproduction."
