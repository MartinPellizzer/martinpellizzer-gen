    "intro": "Carex longipedunculata f. recedens, commonly known as the receding sedge, is a variant of the long-stemmed sedge, characterized by its distinctive morphological features. It is a perennial plant native to certain regions of North America, typically found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and wetlands. The plant exhibits a clump-forming growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly recurved at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spike that bears small, three-lobed flowers, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
