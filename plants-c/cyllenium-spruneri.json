It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Cyllenium spruneri is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss."
