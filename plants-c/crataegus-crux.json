    "intro": "Crataegus crux, commonly known as the cross-shaped hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, often five-lobed leaves and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus crux is typically found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
