It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, narrow leaflets and clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential medicinal research."
