    "intro": "Cardamine ovata var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth water-crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, calcareous habitats. It features trifoliate leaves with a rounded base and smooth, waxy surfaces, distinguishing it from other varieties of Cardamine. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wet meadows and stream banks. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates."
