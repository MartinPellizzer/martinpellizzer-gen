    "intro": "Corydalis aitchisonii subsp. kamelinii, commonly known as the Kashmir corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of Jammu and Kashmir. It is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
