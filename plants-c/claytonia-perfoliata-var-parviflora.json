It features rosettes of fleshy, basal leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers in early spring, which bloom above the foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting early pollinators."
