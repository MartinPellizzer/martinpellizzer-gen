    "intro": "Coris monspeliensis f. sublongispina, commonly known as the long-spined coris, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Coris monspeliensis species. It is characterized by its elongated, spiny bracts that distinguish it from the typical form of the plant. This plant is native to specific regions in southern Europe, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. Its botanical features include narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
