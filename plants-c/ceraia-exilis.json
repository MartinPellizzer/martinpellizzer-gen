It is characterized by its elongated, spiral shell that is typically smooth and pale in color. This species is found in various freshwater habitats, including ponds, streams, and wetlands, where it thrives in moist environments. The shell of Ceraia exilis serves as both a protective structure and a means of camouflage. Its diet primarily consists of algae and plant debris, contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat."
