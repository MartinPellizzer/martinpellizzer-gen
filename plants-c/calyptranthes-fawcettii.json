    "intro": "Calyptranthes fawcettii, commonly known as the Fawcett's calyptranthes, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Calyptranthes fawcettii is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories."
