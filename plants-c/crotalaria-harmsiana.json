    "intro": "Crotalaria harmsiana, commonly known as the African morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine in some regions. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous to livestock and humans."
