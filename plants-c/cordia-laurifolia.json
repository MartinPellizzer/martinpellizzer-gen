    "intro": "Cordia laurifolia, commonly known as the sweet gum tree, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and ovate leaves that turn vibrant colors in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by spherical, spiky fruits containing seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish, often exuding a milky sap when damaged. Cordia laurifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in landscapes for its seasonal foliage and unique fruit structure."
