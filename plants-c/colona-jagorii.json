It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Colona jagorii plays a significant role in the biodiversity of its ecosystem and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
