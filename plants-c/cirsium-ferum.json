    "intro": "Cirsium ferum, commonly known as common thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are covered in stiff, prickly hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, and are visited by various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
