    "intro": "Calamagrostis montevidensis var. armata, commonly known as the Montevideo feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly Uruguay and southern Brazil. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, silver-green blades that are often tinged with purple at the base. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically brown or reddish in color, appearing in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
