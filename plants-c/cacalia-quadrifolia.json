    "intro": "Cacalia quadrifolia, commonly known as the four-leaved clover, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, rounded fruits called schizocarps. Cacalia quadrifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its association with luck, especially when found with four leaves."
