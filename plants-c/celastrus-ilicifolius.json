    "intro": "Celastrus ilicifolius, commonly known as the leatherleaf celastre, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its roots and stems contain various alkaloids, which have been studied for potential medicinal properties. Celastrus ilicifolius thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
