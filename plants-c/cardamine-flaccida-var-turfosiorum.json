    "intro": "Cardamine flaccida var. turfosiorum, commonly known as the bog buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to moist, shaded environments in northern regions. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to thrive in wet, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and contribute to the nutrient cycling in its habitat. This variety is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of streams."
