    "intro": "Cyrtandra mooreaensis, commonly known as the Moorea cyrtandra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to the island of Moorea in French Polynesia, where it grows in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for native pollinators. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
