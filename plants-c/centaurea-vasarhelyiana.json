It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It produces vibrant purple-blue flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
