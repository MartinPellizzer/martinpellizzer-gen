    "intro": "Castanopsis pierrei, commonly known as the Sierra Madre chinquapin, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its leathery, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by hard, woody nuts enclosed in a spiny cupule. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Castanopsis pierrei is considered a rare and endangered species."
