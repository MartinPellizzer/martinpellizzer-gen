    "intro": "Crambe maritima var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered sea kale, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its robust growth and ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions make it an important component of coastal ecosystems. The variety 'grandiflora' is distinguished by its larger, more prominent flowers compared to the typical species."
