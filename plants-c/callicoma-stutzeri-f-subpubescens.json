    "intro": "Callicoma stutzeri f. subpubescens, commonly known as the silver-haired hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink or red. The plant has a shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are often visited by bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance. The subspecies subpubescens is distinguished by its reduced pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to other forms of Callicoma stutzeri."
