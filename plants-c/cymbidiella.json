    "intro": "Cymbidiella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, often translucent or pale green leaves that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant produces delicate, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the late spring or early summer. Cymbidiella is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
