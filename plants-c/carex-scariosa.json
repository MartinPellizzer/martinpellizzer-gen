    "intro": "Carex scariosa, commonly known as the scarious sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in horticulture for erosion control due to its dense root system. The leaves are usually narrow and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in wet environments."
