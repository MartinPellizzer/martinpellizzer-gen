    "intro": "Cecropia occidentalis, commonly known as the west Indian ceiba, is a large tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive buttressed roots and smooth, often grayish bark. The plant has pinnate leaves that are alternate and often have a velvety texture. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
