    "intro": "Cardiocrinum cordatum var. glehnii, commonly known as the Glehn's heartleaf lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, bell-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often at high altitudes, and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value lies in its elegant foliage and vibrant, often pink or white, floral display. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its natural range."
