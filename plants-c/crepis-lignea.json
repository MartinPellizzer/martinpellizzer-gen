    "intro": "Crepis lignea, commonly known as the wood crepis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a sturdy, upright stem covered in fine hairs, with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy as well. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in loose panicles, producing a distinctive appearance. Crepis lignea is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other woodland flora."
