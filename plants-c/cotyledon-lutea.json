    "intro": "Cotyledon lutea, commonly known as the yellow cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically yellow or green, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the growing season. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in arid conditions. Cotyledon lutea is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
