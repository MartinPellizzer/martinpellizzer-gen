    "intro": "Clerodendrum heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable clethra, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that vary in shape and size. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Clerodendrum heterophyllum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
