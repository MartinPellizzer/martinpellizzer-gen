    "intro": "Calanthe pulchra, commonly known as the beautiful calanthe, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant features a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. Calanthe pulchra is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
