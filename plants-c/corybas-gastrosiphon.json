    "intro": "Corybas gastrosiphon, commonly known as the New Zealand ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to New Zealand. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive, hooded flower that lacks a typical petal structure. The plant has a short, erect stem and produces a single, elongated, greenish-brown flower that resembles a ghostly face. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to grow in rocky or forested areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered critically endangered and is protected in its native range."
