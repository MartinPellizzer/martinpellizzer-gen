    "intro": "Cheirostylis octodactyla, commonly known as the eight-fingered orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which features a cluster of small, fragrant flowers with intricate, spurred petals. Its leaves are typically long and strap-like, adapted to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
