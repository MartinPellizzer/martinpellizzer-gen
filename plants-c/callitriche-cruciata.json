    "intro": "Callitriche cruciata, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually floating or submerged, with a rosette-like arrangement. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale blue, and appear in clusters near the water's surface. Callitriche cruciata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through its biological activity."
