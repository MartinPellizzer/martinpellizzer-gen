    "intro": "Coffea canephora var. opaca, commonly known as the Congo coffee or Opaca coffee, is a variant of the robusta coffee species. It is native to Central and West Africa, where it thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and produces large, oval-shaped red berries containing two seeds. It is valued for its robust flavor profile and high caffeine content, making it a popular choice in specialty coffee blends. However, it is less commonly cultivated than other coffee varieties due to its specific growing requirements."
