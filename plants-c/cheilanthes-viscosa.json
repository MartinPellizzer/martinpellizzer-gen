    "intro": "Cheilanthes viscosa, commonly known as the sticky rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial plant characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, leathery fronds. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its ability to store water in its rhizomes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. The sticky resin on its leaves helps deter herbivores and reduce water loss, making it well-suited to its harsh environment."
