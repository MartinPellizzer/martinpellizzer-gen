    "intro": "Cryptandra arbutiflora var. intermedia, commonly known as the grey cryptandra, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or pale red, arranged in clusters along the stems. These flowers are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits that release small, angular seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
