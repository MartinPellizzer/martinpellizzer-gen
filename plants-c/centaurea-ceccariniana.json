    "intro": "Centaurea ceccariniana, commonly known as the Sicilian starthistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking purple to blue flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and open woodlands. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Centaurea ceccariniana is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies."
