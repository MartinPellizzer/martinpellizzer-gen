    "intro": "Chondrosum prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It has small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces tiny white or yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in extreme conditions where few other plants can grow."
