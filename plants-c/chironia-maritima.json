    "intro": "Chironia maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has silvery, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines. Chironia maritima is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
