    "intro": "Crocus nervifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf crocus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Iridaceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, typically growing in rocky or limestone soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking violet or purple flowers with a distinctive, recurved petal. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. Crocus nervifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit."
