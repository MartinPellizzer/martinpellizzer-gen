    "intro": "Cuphea ingrata, commonly known as the sticky cuphea, is a flowering plant native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular red or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which can deter herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners in warmer climates. Cuphea ingrata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and easy care requirements."
