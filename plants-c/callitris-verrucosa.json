    "intro": "Callitris verrucosa, commonly known as the rough-corked pine, is a species of conifer native to Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, scaly bark that provides protection against fire and drought. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are scale-like and closely pressed to the stems, reducing water loss in arid environments. This hardy species is often found in coastal and inland regions, contributing to the ecological stability of its habitat."
