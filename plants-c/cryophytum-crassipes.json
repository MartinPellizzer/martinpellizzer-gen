It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant features sturdy, fleshy stems that store water, aiding survival in arid or frost-prone regions. Its leaves are typically broad and lobed, often with a waxy surface to reduce moisture loss. Cryophytum crassipes is found in high-altitude areas and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
