    "intro": "Cyclosorus angustipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cyclosorus, is a small aquatic fern found in freshwater habitats. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which help it absorb nutrients from the water. Cyclosorus angustipes plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems but is an important indicator species for water quality."
