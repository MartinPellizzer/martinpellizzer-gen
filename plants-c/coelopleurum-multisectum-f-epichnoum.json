    "intro": "Coelopleurum multisectum f. epichnoum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a rare and distinctive fern species characterized by its unique frond structure. The plant features finely dissected, pinnately compound leaves that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. The fronds are typically dark green with a slightly rough texture, and they may exhibit a bluish or silvery hue on the underside. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
