    "intro": "Cyclostemon stipularis, commonly known as the stipular cyclostemon, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which includes a peculiar arrangement of stamens and petals. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in dense forests or along riverbanks. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cyclostemon stipularis is considered a botanical curiosity and is of interest to researchers studying plant evolution and adaptation."
