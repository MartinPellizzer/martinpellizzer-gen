    "intro": "Chrysojasminum subhumile var. glabricymosum, commonly known as the slender golden jasmine, is a flowering plant characterized by its delicate, fragrant white to yellow flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. The plant has slender, creeping stems with small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers bloom in clusters and emit a sweet, honey-like fragrance, attracting pollinators like bees and moths.
