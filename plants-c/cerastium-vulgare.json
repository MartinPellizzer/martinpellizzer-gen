    "intro": "Cerastium vulgare, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, fleshy, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tiny white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and garden beds. Its stems are prostrate, often rooting at the nodes, which helps it spread vegetatively. Cerastium vulgare is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in many regions."
