    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 aurantium var. carnosa, commonly known as the rough lemon. This variety is characterized by its thick, rugged, and often pebbled rind, which gives it its name. It is a hybrid citrus plant, originating from crosses between different citrus species. The leaves are typically broad and ovate, with a slightly serrated margin. While it is not widely cultivated for fruit production, it is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and as a parent plant in citrus breeding programs."
