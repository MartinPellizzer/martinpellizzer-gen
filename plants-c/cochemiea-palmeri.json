    "intro": "Cochemiea palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in small, spine-tipped tubercles, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, spiny structure. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert scrublands. Cochemiea palmeri is a slow-growing plant that is well adapted to survive in harsh, low-water conditions."
