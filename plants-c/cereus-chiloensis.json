    "intro": "Cereus chiloensis, commonly known as the Chilean night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Cereus chiloensis is well adapted to coastal and desert climates, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil."
