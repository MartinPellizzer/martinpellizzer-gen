    "intro": "Cryptanthus grazielae, commonly known as the \"Rainbow Grass\" or \"Beaded Beauty,\" is a strikingly colorful plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact rosette of grass-like leaves. The leaves are typically bright red, orange, or yellow, creating a vibrant display that resembles a cluster of beads. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. This plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its vivid coloration."
