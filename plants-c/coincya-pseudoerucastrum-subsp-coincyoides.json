It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often emerging from the water surface. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its morphology and reproductive structures are adapted to aquatic environments, facilitating both vegetative propagation and sexual reproduction."
