    "intro": "Cyathea sellae, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots and a crown of feathery fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, arching shape. Cyathea sellae plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's native ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity."
