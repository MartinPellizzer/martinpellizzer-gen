    "intro": "Cynometra kisantuensis, commonly known as the Kisantu teak, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elongated, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
