    "intro": "Coursetia planipetiolata, commonly known as the flat-petioled coursetia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round, woody fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental potential, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
