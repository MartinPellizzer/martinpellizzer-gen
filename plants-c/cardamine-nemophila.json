    "intro": "Cardamine nemophila, commonly known as the northern water shield, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy layer. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in wet, clay-rich soils. Cardamine nemophila is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of streams and ponds."
