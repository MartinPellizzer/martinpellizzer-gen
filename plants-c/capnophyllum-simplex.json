    "intro": "Capnophyllum simplex, commonly known as the simple capillary plant, is a unique species characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that resemble fine capillaries. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant's structure is simple, with no true stems, and its leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern along its central axis. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to their minimal size and lack of showy petals. Capnophyllum simplex is primarily found in temperate regions and is known for its role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
