    "intro": "Callitriche pendunculata, commonly known as the water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with tiny white flowers that bloom in early summer. It is often found in still or slow-moving water, where it can spread via runners and form dense mats. Callitriche pendunculata plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by reducing water flow and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
