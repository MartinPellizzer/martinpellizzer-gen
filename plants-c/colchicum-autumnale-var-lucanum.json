    "intro": "Colchicum autumnale var. lucanum, commonly known as the meadow death cap, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a bulbous perennial that produces striking violet or purple flowers in late summer and autumn. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, particularly colchicine, which can be lethal if ingested. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Due to its toxicity, it is often mistaken for edible mushrooms, posing a significant risk to foragers."
