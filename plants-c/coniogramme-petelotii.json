    "intro": "Coniogramme petelotii, commonly known as the Petelot's coniogramme, is a rare and delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in dense forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
