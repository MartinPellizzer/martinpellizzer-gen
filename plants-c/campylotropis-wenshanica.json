It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its unique, bottle-shaped stipules. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
