    "intro": "Carex haematopus, commonly known as the bloodstained sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a slightly rough texture, while its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize soil in wet environments. Carex haematopus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and filter contaminated water."
