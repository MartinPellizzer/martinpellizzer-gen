It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage. However, it is not widely known or commercially grown compared to other chrysanthemum species."
