    "intro": "Cyrtandra davaoensis, commonly known as the Davao Cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines, specifically found in the regions of Davao and Mindanao. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family, which is characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually tubular with five lobes, and they bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
