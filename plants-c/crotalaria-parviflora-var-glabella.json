    "intro": "Crotalaria parviflora var. glabella, commonly known as the woolly crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellow, pea-like flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in poor soil conditions. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, and the plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and pastures. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
