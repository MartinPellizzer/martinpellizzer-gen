    "intro": "Celtis punctata, commonly known as the punctate hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that are typically green when immature and turn yellow or red when mature. Celtis punctata is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. It plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects, through its fruit and foliage."
