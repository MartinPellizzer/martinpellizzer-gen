    "intro": "Capsicum oblongifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chili or wild chili, is a species native to Central America and parts of South America. It is a herbaceous plant with slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into elongated, thin fruits, which can range in color from green to red depending on maturity. Its botanical characteristics make it distinct from more commonly cultivated chili species like Capsicum annuum. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is used in traditional medicine and as a spice in some regions."
