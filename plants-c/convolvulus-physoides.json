    "intro": "Convolvulus physoides, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, exhibiting drought tolerance due to its deep root system. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are usually pale blue or purple, blooming in the early morning. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often prostrate or ascending. Convolvulus physoides plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas and provides nectar for pollinators."
