    "intro": "Callopisma perfoliatum, commonly known as the devil's bit scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that often have a fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas. Callopisma perfoliatum is a perennial herb that can grow up to 30 centimeters tall, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable."
