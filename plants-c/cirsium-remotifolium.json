    "intro": "Cirsium remotifolium, commonly known as the distant-leaved thistle, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and open woodlands. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads."
