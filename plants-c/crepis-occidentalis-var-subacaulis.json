    "intro": "Crepis occidentalis var. subacaulis, commonly known as the western mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to western North America. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It is characterized by its short, compact stature and is often found in disturbed or early successional sites. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy."
