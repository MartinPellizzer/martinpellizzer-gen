    "intro": "Combretum albidum, commonly known as white flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate leaves that turn red before falling in winter. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in savannas and along riverbanks. Combretum albidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
