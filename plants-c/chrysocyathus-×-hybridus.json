    "intro": "Chrysocyathus \u00d7 hybridus, commonly known as the hybrid sea holly, is a rare and intriguing plant that combines traits from its parent species, Chrysocyathus sphaericus and Chrysocyathus luteus. It is characterized by its striking, spiky, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is typically found in coastal areas with sandy or gravelly soils, where it thrives in full sun. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies, particularly in the fields of horticulture and coastal ecology. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a conservation concern."
