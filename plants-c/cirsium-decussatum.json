    "intro": "Cirsium decussatum, commonly known as the clustered thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which attract various pollinators. Cirsium decussatum is often used in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
