    "intro": "Corbularia bulbocodium, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces yellow disc flowers surrounded by blue to violet ray florets, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found growing in shallow tidal zones."
