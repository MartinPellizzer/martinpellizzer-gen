It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a dense, fuzzy texture that gives it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Ceanothus griseus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
