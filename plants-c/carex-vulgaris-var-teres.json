    "intro": "Carex vulgaris var. teres, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a tight, cylindrical cluster. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in aquatic environments."
