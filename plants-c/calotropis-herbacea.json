    "intro": "Calotropis herbacea, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is a shrub or small tree with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, pale yellow or greenish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The latex sap of Calotropis herbacea is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it a plant to handle with care."
