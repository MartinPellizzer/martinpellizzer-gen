    "intro": "Coussapoa darienensis, commonly known as the Darien mountain palm, is a rare and endemic species native to the Darien region of Panama. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feather-like leaves. The plant thrives in humid, tropical lowland forests, often growing near streams or in shaded understories. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it faces threats to its survival in the wild."
