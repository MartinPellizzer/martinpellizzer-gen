    "intro": "Cereus hollianus, commonly known as the holiday cactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its segmented stems and clusters of vibrant, showy flowers that bloom during the winter months. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, fleshy stems that store water, a feature common in desert plants. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with a distinctive white or yellow center, and it is well adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions. Cereus hollianus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and seasonal blooming habit."
