    "intro": "Cyclosorus dissimulans, commonly known as the hidden wheel moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and intricate, overlapping leaf structures that form a dense mat. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can retain adequate humidity. Its leaves are usually arranged in a spiral pattern, giving the plant a distinctive, wheel-like appearance. Cyclosorus dissimulans plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various small invertebrates."
