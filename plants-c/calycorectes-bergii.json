    "intro": "Calycorectes bergii, commonly known as the Berg's calycorectes, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its distinctive floral structure. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a unique calyx that remains attached to the fruit. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Calycorectes bergii is considered a vulnerable species."
