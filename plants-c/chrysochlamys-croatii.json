    "intro": "Chrysochlamys croatii, commonly known as the Croatian chrysochlamys, is a member of the Rutaceae family, native to the Balkan region. It is a small, deciduous shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
