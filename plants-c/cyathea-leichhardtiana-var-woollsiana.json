    "intro": "Cyathea leichhardtiana var. woollsiana, commonly known as the Wooll's tree fern, is a species native to Australia, particularly found in the eastern regions. It is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often in rainforests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, nutrient-rich soil. This variety is notable for its slow growth and can live for several decades, making it a significant component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
