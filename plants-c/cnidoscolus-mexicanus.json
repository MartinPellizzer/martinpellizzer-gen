    "intro": "Cnidoscolus mexicanus, commonly known as the Mexican stinging leaf or \"huito,\" is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that have a stinging sap. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange or red fruits containing edible seeds. Its latex contains irritants that can cause skin irritation, making handling the plant require caution. Despite its defensive properties, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local cultures."
