    "intro": "Campanula volubilis, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial species that typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its trailing growth habit makes it suitable for ground cover, and it has lance-shaped, dark green leaves. Campanula volubilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
