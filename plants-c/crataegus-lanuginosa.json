    "intro": "Crataegus lanuginosa, commonly known as the downy hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish bark and oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. Crataegus lanuginosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
