    "intro": "Carex xuanchengensis, commonly known as the Xuancheng sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to China, specifically the Hubei and Sichuan provinces, where it grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. The plant is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, typical of the sedge family. It plays an important role in its ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
