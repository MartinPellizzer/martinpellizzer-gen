    "intro": "Castilleja rubicundula, commonly known as the red-stemmed Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a short, stout stem and lacks true leaves, relying on its root system to absorb nutrients from neighboring plants. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Castilleja rubicundula plays an important role in pollination and is a symbol of the wildflower diversity in its native range."
