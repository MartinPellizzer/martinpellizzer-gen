    "intro": "Cnicus lappaceus, commonly known as the common sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by feathery, bract-like structures that give it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Cnicus lappaceus is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well adapted to coastal and disturbed habitats."
