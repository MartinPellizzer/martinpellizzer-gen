    "intro": "Carduus crispus subsp. agrestis, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in grasslands, roadsides, and wastelands. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a distinctive crinkled texture, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
