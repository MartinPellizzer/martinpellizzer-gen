    "intro": "Crinum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features strap-like, narrow leaves that are typically green and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tall, erect stems that bear showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. These flowers are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Crinum angustifolium thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds."
