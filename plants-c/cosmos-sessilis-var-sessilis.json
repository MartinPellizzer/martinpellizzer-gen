    "intro": "Cosmos sessilis var. sessilis, commonly known as the sessile cosmos, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, and are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens. The plant produces seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to naturalize in suitable environments."
