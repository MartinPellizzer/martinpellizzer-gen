    "intro": "Cakile latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, yellow flowers and pinnately compound leaves. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively. Cakile latifolia is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
