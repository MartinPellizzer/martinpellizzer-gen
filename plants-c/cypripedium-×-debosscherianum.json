It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its large, showy, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant features a rhizomatous root system and grows in shaded, moist woodland environments. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single flower per stem. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
