    "intro": "Coronaria flos-jovis, commonly known as the Jupiter's flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals that resemble a crown, giving it its Latin name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
