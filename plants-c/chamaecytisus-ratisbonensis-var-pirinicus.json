    "intro": "Chamaecytisus ratisbonensis var. pirinicus, commonly known as the Pirin Broom, is a shrub native to the Balkan region, particularly found in the Pirin Mountains of Bulgaria. It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are small, leathery, and evergreen, contributing to its hardy nature. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. This variety is closely related to the common broom, but it exhibits distinct morphological features adapted to its mountainous habitat."
