    "intro": "Copiapoa rupestris subsp. desertorum, commonly known as the Desert Copiapoa, is a cactus native to the Atacama Desert in northern Chile. It is a low-growing, columnar cactus with ribbed stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. It is adapted to extreme arid conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. This subspecies is often found growing in rocky crevices, where it can access limited moisture and nutrients."
