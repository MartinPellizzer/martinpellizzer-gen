    "intro": "Capraria diffusa, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Capraria diffusa is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in harsh coastal environments."
