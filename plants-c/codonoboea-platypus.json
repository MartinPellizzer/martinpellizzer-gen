It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often flat or slightly folded. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
