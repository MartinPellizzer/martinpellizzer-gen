    "intro": "Catha articulata, commonly known as khat, is a flowering plant native to the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its shrub-like structure with smooth, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody, three-lobed fruits containing seeds. The leaves contain psychoactive compounds, primarily cathinone and cathine, which are responsible for its stimulating effects. It is often cultivated for both ornamental and traditional medicinal purposes."
