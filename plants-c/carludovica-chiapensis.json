    "intro": "Carludovica chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the tropical rainforests of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Carludovica chiapensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
