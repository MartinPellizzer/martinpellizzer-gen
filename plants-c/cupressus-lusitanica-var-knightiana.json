    "intro": "Cupressus lusitanica var. knightiana, commonly known as the Knight's Portuguese cypress, is a rare and ornamental conifer native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its narrow, columnar growth habit and dense, dark green foliage that provides a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically reddish-brown in color. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant. Due to its limited natural range and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern."
