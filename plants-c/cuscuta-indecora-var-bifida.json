    "intro": "Cuscuta indecora var. bifida, commonly known as the twin-lobed dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is characterized by its bifid (split) leaves, which are typically found at the base of the stems. It is often found growing on various agricultural and wild plants, including grasses and legumes. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and is considered a weed in many regions."
