    "intro": "Clidemia insularis, commonly known as the Hawaiian stinging nettle, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a dense covering of fine, stinging hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in cymes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Clidemia insularis is an important component of Hawaii's native ecosystems, though it is also considered an invasive species in some regions."
