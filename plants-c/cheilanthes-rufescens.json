    "intro": "Cheilanthes rufescens, commonly known as the rusty shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a terrestrial plant that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with densely packed, leathery leaves that are usually a dull green to reddish-brown in color. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is well adapted to drought conditions and can survive in nutrient-poor soils due to its specialized root system."
