    "intro": "Cerastium rubescens f. takedae, commonly known as the Takeda's mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to Japan. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The flowers are white or pale pink, with five petals, and bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense, ground-covering mats."
