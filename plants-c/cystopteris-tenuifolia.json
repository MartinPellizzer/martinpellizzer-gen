    "intro": "Cystopteris tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender female fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce both sterile and fertile fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its graceful appearance."
