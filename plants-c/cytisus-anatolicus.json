    "intro": "Cytisus anatolicus, commonly known as Anatolian broom, is a shrub native to Turkey and parts of the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or bean family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its small, pod-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across arid environments. Cytisus anatolicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in some regions for its medicinal properties."
