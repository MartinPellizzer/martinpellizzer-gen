It is characterized by its distinctive, warty, and often colorful leaves that can range from green to red or purple. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkin-like inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Croton opponens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
