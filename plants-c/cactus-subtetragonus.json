    "intro": "Cactus subtetragonus, commonly known as the four-angled cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed stems that are typically four-angled in cross-section. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warm season, which are often followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its adaptations include thick, waxy cuticles to reduce water loss and spines for protection against herbivores. Cactus subtetragonus is well-suited to harsh desert environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
