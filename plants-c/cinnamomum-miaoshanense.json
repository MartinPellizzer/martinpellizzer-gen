    "intro": "Cinnamomum miaoshanense, commonly known as the Miaoshan cinnamon, is a species of flowering plant in the Lauraceae family. It is native to China, specifically found in the mountainous regions of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. Its bark, similar to true cinnamon, contains essential oils and has been used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical research."
