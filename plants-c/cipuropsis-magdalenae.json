    "intro": "Cipuropsis magdalenae, commonly known as the Magdalena cipuropsis, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue and violet flowers, which bloom in late spring and early summer. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
