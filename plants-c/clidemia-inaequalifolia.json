    "intro": "Clidemia inaequalifolia, commonly known as the Hawaiian stiltgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a distinctive white midrib. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions outside its native habitat."
