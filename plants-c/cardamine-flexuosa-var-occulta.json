It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged in a spiral pattern, while its flowers are small and usually white or pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
