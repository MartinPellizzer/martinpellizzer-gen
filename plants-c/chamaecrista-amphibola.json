    "intro": "Chamaecrista amphibola, commonly known as the water bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows near water sources, such as rivers and wetlands, due to its preference for moist environments. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets. Chamaecrista amphibola is known for its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils, making it an important species in aquatic and riparian ecosystems. It also has medicinal uses in traditional medicine, although its toxic properties require caution in handling."
