    "intro": "Carphochaete wislizeni, commonly known as the wislizeni goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss in its native habitat."
