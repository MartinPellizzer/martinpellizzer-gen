    "intro": "Chionographis actinomorpha, commonly known as the silver leaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of North America. It features a rosette of silvery, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a frosty appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are clustered in a single umbel at the center of the rosette. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
