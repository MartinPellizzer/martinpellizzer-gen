    "intro": "Coffea fadenii, commonly known as the Faden's coffee, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia, where it thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds used for coffee production, though it is not widely cultivated for commercial use. Its botanical characteristics include glossy leaves and a compact growth habit, making it a unique subject for botanical study. Due to its limited distribution and low yield, it remains a niche species in the world of coffee."
