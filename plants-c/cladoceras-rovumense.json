    "intro": "Cladoceras rovumense, commonly known as the Rovuma river candelabra, is a unique aquatic plant found in the Rovuma River basin of Mozambique. It is characterized by its distinctive branching structure that resembles a candelabra, with multiple stems emerging from a central base. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are adapted for floating or semi-aquatic environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Cladoceras rovumense plays a role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for aquatic life."
