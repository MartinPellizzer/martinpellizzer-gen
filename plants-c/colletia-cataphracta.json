    "intro": "Colletia cataphracta, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often on rocky or sandy soils. The plant features a short, woody stem with dense, spiny foliage, and it produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. Colletia cataphracta is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
