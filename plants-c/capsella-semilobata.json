It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are pale yellow with four petals. It produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
