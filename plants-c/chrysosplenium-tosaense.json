It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its delicate, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
