    "intro": "Chrysanthemum prostratum, commonly known as creeping chrysanthemum, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to China. It features a mat-forming growth habit with sprawling stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, white, and orange, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its foliage consists of dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden landscapes for its ability to cover ground and suppress weeds."
