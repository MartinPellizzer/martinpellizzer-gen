    "intro": "Cornopteris \u00d7 masachikana, commonly known as the hybrid rock fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Cornopteris leioptera and Cornopteris mackayi. It is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that often exhibit a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky, shaded environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it is often found in forested areas with high humidity. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for survival."
