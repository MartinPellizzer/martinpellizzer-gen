    "intro": "Cissus populnea, commonly known as the climbing cissus, is a vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the presence of tendrils that help it climb surfaces. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in small, translucent glands. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in clusters, and it produces yellowish fruits that contain several seeds. Cissus populnea is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in humid environments."
