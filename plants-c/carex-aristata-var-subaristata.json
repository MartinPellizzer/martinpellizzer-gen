    "intro": "Carex aristata var. subaristata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize new areas. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with three stamens and a single pistil, typical of the sedge family."
