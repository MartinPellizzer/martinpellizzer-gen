It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its simple, basal leaves and a slender, unbranched stem. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in a umbel, typical of the carrot family. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
