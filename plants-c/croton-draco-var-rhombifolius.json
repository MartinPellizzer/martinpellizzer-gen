    "intro": "Croton draco var. rhombifolius, commonly known as the rhombifoliate croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, rhomboid-shaped leaves that are often glossy and green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range from yellow to orange, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not commonly found in cultivation outside its native range."
