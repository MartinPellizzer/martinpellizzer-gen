    "intro": "Caladenia corynephora, commonly known as the Purple-veined Spider-orchid, is an endemic plant species native to Western Australia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, erect stem and single, strikingly colored flower with a distinctive purple-veined lip. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as shrublands and grassy areas. It produces its flowers during the autumn season, and the species is known for its intricate floral structure that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
