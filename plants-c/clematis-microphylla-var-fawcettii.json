It features small, dark green leaves that are typically less than an inch in length, giving it a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, ornamental vine. Its compact size and showy blooms make it suitable for trellises, fences, or as a standalone specimen plant."
