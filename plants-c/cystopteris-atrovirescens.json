    "intro": "Cystopteris atrovirescens, commonly known as the darkening spleenwort, is a fern species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically have a dark green coloration that may darken with age. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Cystopteris atrovirescens is often found growing on rocky substrates and is relatively widespread in temperate regions."
