    "intro": "Cornus riparia, commonly known as red osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that turn bright red in the fall, providing striking visual interest. The plant produces small white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries that attract birds. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn. Cornus riparia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
