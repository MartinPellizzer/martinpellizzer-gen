    "intro": "Callithauma spathulatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved sea anemone, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the order Actinioidea. It is characterized by its soft, fleshy body and long, flexible tentacles that surround a central mouth. The plant, or more accurately the organism, has a unique structure with a pedal disc used for attachment to surfaces. Its coloration can vary, often displaying shades of pink, red, or orange, which serve as camouflage in its marine environment. Callithauma spathulatum plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling."
