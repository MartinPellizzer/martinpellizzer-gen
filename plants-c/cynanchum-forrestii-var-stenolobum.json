    "intro": "Cynanchum forrestii var. stenolobum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed milkvetch, is a perennial climbing plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite leaves with a narrow, lanceolate shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in rocky or forested habitats and is often found at higher elevations. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
