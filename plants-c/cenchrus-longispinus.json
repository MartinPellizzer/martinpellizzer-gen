    "intro": "Cenchrus longispinus, commonly known as the long-spined grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, sunny conditions. Its dense growth habit makes it useful for erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
