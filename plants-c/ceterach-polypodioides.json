    "intro": "Ceterach polypodioides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in coastal heathlands. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with numerous tiny, tooth-like pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance. Ceterach polypodioides is well adapted to salt-laden air and is an important component of coastal ecosystems."
