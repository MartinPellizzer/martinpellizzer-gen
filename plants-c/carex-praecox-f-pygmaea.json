    "intro": "Carex praecox f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf early sedge, is a compact, mat-forming plant native to moist, acidic habitats in the northern hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, making it well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires consistent moisture. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to wetland restoration projects and native plant gardens."
