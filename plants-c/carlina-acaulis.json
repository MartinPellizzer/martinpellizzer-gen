    "intro": "Carlina acaulis, commonly known as the mountain ragwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright, stemless growth habit and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green composite flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Carlina acaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
