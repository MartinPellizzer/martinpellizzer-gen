    "intro": "Cotula vulgaris, commonly known as the common groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb with small, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in open fields. Cotula vulgaris is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
