It features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late spring. The plant is dioecious, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
