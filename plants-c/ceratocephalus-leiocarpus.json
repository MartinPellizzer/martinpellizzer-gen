    "intro": "Ceratocephalus leiocarpus, commonly known as the smooth-seeded sandbur, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, spiny burrs that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with ray florets. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
