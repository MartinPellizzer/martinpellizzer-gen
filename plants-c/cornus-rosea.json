    "intro": "Cornus rosea, commonly known as the red twig dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its bright red stems that persist through winter, providing striking visual interest. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that attract birds. Its leaves are typically ovate with serrated edges, and they turn yellow or red in the fall. Cornus rosea is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
