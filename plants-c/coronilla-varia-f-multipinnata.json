It is characterized by its compound leaves with multiple pairs of pinnate leaflets, giving it the subspecies name *multipinnata*. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant in sustainable agriculture and land restoration projects."
