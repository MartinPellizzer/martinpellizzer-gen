    "intro": "Coryanthes wenzeliana, commonly known as the Wenzel's pitcher plant, is a unique carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its striking, elongated, and often colorful inflorescences that resemble pitchers, which are used to trap insects. The plant's flowers are highly specialized, with a complex structure that includes a nectar-secreting lid and a slippery inner surface to aid in trapping prey. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric humidity to maintain its delicate structure. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
