    "intro": "Cyperus gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found in wetlands and along the edges of water bodies. Cyperus gardneri is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
