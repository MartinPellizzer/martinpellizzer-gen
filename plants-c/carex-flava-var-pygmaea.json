    "intro": "Carex flava var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf yellow sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northeastern United States. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream edges. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright yellow to green in color. It produces small, inconspicuous brown flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spikelets. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
