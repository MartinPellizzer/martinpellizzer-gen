    "intro": "Calendula suffruticosa subsp. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly calendula, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its hairy texture, which gives it the common name, helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It is often used in herbal medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant blooms and hardy nature."
