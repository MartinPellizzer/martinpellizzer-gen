    "intro": "Canna musifolia-edulis, commonly known as the edible canna, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, colorful leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length, and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to yellow. The plant is a herbaceous perennial, growing from a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vigorously. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, while its edible roots and young shoots are consumed as a vegetable in some regions. The plant thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes as well as for its edible parts."
