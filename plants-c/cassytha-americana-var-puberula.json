    "intro": "Cassytha americana var. puberula, commonly known as the hairy cassytha, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread extensively. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and covered in fine, hairy pubescence, giving it a distinct appearance. The hairy cassytha is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
