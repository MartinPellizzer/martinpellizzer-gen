    "intro": "Cornus papillosa, commonly known as the silky dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its showy, white bracts that surround small, yellowish flowers, which appear in late spring. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are a food source for various birds and small mammals. Its leaves are ovate with a serrated margin and turn bright red in the autumn. Cornus papillosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands."
