    "intro": "Coryphantha henricksonii, commonly known as the Henrickson's cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, compact plant with a globular stem that often branches into a bushy form. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Coryphantha henricksonii is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
