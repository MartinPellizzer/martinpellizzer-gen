It features woody stems with distinctive, segmented leaves that are often lobed or divided. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible but should be consumed in moderation. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance. Cyphostemma segmentatum is also valued for its traditional medicinal uses in some African cultures."
