    "intro": "Cardamine leucantha subsp. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its subspecific name, *tomentella*, refers to the distinctive tomentose (fuzzy) appearance of its foliage."
