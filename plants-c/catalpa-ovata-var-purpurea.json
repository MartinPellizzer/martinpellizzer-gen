    "intro": "Catalpa ovata var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in shades of white and purple. The leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a slightly serrated edge. This variety is distinguished by its more vibrant floral coloration compared to the typical Catalpa ovata. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
