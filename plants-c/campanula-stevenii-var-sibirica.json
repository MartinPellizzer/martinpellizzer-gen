    "intro": "Campanula stevenii var. sibirica, commonly known as Siberian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Siberia and Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically blue to violet in color, which bloom in late summer. The leaves are lanceolate, serrated, and covered in a fine layer of down, giving them a soft texture. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
