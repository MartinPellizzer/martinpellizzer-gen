    "intro": "Cycas aculeata, commonly known as the spiny cycad, is a primitive gymnosperm native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones spherical and spiny. Cycas aculeata is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
