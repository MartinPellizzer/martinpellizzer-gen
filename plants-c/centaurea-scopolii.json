It is characterized by its spiky, bristly seed heads that resemble tiny needles, which give it its common name. The plant produces vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in temperate climates. Centaurea scopolii is often found in dry grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides."
