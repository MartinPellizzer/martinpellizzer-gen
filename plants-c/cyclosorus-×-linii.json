    "intro": "Cyclosorus \u00d7 linii, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cyclosorus sanguineus and Cyclosorus linii. It is a perennial aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that float on the water surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
