    "intro": "Copiapoa applanata, commonly known as the flat copiapoa, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces white or pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, making it a long-lived desert plant. Copiapoa applanata is well adapted to arid conditions, storing water in its thick stems and reducing water loss through its hairy covering."
