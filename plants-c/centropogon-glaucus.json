    "intro": "Centropogon glaucus, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Centropogon glaucus typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, acidic soils. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for wetland restoration and native garden landscapes."
