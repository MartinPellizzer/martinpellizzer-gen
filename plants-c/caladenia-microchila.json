    "intro": "Caladenia microchila, commonly known as the dwarf spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that resemble spiders, typically appearing in shades of yellow and green. The plant produces a single, slender stem that bears a single flower, which is often adorned with intricate markings. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
