    "intro": "Candollea pubigera, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to tropical regions of South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments, and the plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the leaves. Its botanical features make it a popular specimen for botanical gardens and a subject of study in plant morphology."
