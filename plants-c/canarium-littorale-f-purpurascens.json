    "intro": "Canarium littorale f. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-leafed candlenut, is a variant of the candlenut tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking purplish foliage, which becomes more pronounced in full sun. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by oval, woody fruits containing toxic seeds. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in mangrove or tidal forest ecosystems. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated for landscaping and coastal stabilization."
