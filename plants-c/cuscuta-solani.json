    "intro": "Cuscuta solani, commonly known as dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It attaches itself to its host using specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found on crops like tomatoes and potatoes. Its life cycle involves seed dispersal through the wind or by sticking to animals. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
