It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
