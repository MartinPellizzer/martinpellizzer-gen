    "intro": "Clermontia gaudichaudii, commonly known as the Kauai spider-orchid, is a rare endemic species native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking, spider-like appearance with long, slender petals and a distinctive, narrow spur. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories, where it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and limited natural pollination, it is considered critically endangered. Conservation efforts focus on protecting its remaining populations and promoting genetic diversity through controlled propagation."
