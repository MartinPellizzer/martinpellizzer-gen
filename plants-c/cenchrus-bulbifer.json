It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Additionally, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive, compact form."
