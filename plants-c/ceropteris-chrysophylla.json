    "intro": "Ceropteris chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden frond fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that are often golden-yellow in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its fronds are composed of numerous small, finger-like leaflets that are arranged in a feathery pattern. Ceropteris chrysophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in greenhouses or shaded gardens."
