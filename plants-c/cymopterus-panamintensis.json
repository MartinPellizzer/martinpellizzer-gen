    "intro": "Cymopterus panamintensis, commonly known as the Panamint tansy, is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is native to the deserts of southern California and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky soils, often found in crevices and along canyon walls. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. Cymopterus panamintensis is adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
