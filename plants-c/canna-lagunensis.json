    "intro": "Canna lagunensis, commonly known as the lake canna, is a striking tropical plant native to the wetlands of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces showy, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by brightly colored bracts, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in marshy areas or near water bodies. Canna lagunensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and water features."
