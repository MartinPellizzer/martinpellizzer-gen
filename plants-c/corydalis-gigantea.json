    "intro": "Corydalis gigantea, commonly known as the giant corydalis, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with clusters of vibrant pink to purple flowers. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and its flowers are borne in racemes, adding a dramatic visual display in late spring to early summer. Corydalis gigantea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its showy blooms. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a versatile addition to woodland gardens."
