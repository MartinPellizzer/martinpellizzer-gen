    "intro": "Ctenopterella khaoluangensis, commonly known as the Khaoluang fern, is a rare and unique species native to Thailand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a serrated margin. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
