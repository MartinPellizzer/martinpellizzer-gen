    "intro": "Campanula persicifolia var. reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, giving them a soft texture. This variety is noted for its reflexed petals, which curve backward, distinguishing it from other campanula species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
