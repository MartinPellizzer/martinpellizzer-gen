It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, where the flowers are clustered in a spherical or hemispherical shape, giving the appearance of a head. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or yellow. Cephalophora species are native to various regions in Africa and are often found in grasslands and open habitats. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their distinctive floral display."
