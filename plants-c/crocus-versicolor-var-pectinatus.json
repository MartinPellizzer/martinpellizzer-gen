It produces striking, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive, thickened petal base. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in rocky or dry soils, and it thrives in full sun. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, early-season blooms."
