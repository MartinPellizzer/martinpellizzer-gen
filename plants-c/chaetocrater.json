    "intro": "Chaetocrater, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its striking, silver-blue foliage and spiky, cone-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to salty, windy environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. Chaetocrater is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience."
