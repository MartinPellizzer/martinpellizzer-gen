    "intro": "Caladenia atrata, commonly known as the Black-veined Spider-orchid, is a striking orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and open forests, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features a slender, hairy stem with a single, erect flower that is predominantly white with dark purple or black veining. Its flowers are pollinated by thynnid wasps, which are attracted to the orchid's specialized structure and scent. Caladenia atrata is a protected species due to habitat loss and is often found in conservation reserves."
