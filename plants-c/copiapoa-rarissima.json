    "intro": "Copiapoa rarissima, commonly known as the rare copiapoa, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, round fruits. It is highly adapted to arid conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
