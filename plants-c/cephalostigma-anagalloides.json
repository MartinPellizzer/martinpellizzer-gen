    "intro": "Cephalostigma anagalloides, commonly known as the small-headed bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap microscopic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowers emerge above the water surface. Cephalostigma anagalloides is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the digestion of trapped prey for survival."
