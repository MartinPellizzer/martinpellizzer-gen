    "intro": "Cyperus andreanus var. foliosissimus, commonly known as the broadleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with the leaves often exhibiting a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Due to its adaptability, it is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain ecosystems."
