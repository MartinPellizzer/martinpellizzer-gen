    "intro": "Clermontia samuelii subsp. hanaensis, commonly known as Hana Mountain ginger, is a rare endemic plant found exclusively on the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a member of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its striking, dark red to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforest understories and streamside areas. It has lance-shaped, glossy leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that attract native pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
