It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in terminal clusters, followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for various animals. It thrives in coastal areas and estuaries, adapting to saline and waterlogged soils. Its ecological significance includes stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial life."
