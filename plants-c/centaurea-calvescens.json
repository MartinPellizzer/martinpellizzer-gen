    "intro": "Centaurea calvescens, commonly known as the velvet centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and small, bright blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Centaurea calvescens is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
