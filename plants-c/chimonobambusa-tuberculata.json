It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that are often marked with prominent nodes and small knobs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests and stream sides. Its leaves are long, narrow, and slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This bamboo is valued for its resilience and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or traditional uses."
