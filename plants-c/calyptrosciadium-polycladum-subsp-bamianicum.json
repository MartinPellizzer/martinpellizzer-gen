    "intro": "Calyptrosciadium polycladum subsp. bamianicum, commonly known as the Bamian Mountain cowpea, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect stem and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by lens-shaped pods containing several seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or semi-arid habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
