    "intro": "Campylospermum monticola, commonly known as the mountain campylospermum, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
