    "intro": "Chaptalia cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf chaptalia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a small shrub that typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped, which gives it its common name, and they are usually covered in a fine layer of hairs. Chaptalia cordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
