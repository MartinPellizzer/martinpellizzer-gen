    "intro": "Cowania havardii, commonly known as the desert cowania, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in poor soil conditions. Cowania havardii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
