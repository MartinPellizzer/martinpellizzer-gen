It thrives on rocky outcrops and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with dense, clustered fronds that are typically gray-green in color. Its leaves are pinnately divided and possess a distinctive, sparsely hairy surface. Cheilanthes potosina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to grow in challenging, low-nutrient conditions."
