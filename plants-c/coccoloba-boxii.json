    "intro": "Coccoloba boxii, commonly known as the Florida coccoloba, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, and is often found in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are deeply divided into five to seven lobes, and its small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. It plays an important ecological role in its native environment by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, Coccoloba boxii is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
