    "intro": "Cerastium serpyllifolium, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ability to spread via stolons make it a common ground cover in temperate regions."
