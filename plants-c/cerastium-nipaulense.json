    "intro": "Cerastium nipaulense, commonly known as the Himalayan mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Himalayan regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
