    "intro": "Coursetia barrancana, commonly known as desert mallow, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in sandy or rocky habitats. Coursetia barrancana is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
