    "intro": "Cryptantha ochroleuca, commonly known as the yellow globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, rounded leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces small, round seed pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cryptantha ochroleuca is often found in desert and semi-desert environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
