    "intro": "Cirsium pectinellum, commonly known as the pectinellum thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and woolly, often prickly leaves. The plant typically grows in dry grasslands, rocky soils, and disturbed areas, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped with stiff, spiny margins, and its flowers are purple to pink, arranged in a dense, spherical head. Cirsium pectinellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
