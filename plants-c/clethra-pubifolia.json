    "intro": "Clethra pubifolia, commonly known as sweet pepperbush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, elliptical, blue-black berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, white pubescence. Clethra pubifolia thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks."
