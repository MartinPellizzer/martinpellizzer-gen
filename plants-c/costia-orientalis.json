    "intro": "Costia orientalis, commonly known as the oriental costia, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, often forming dense mats. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water's surface. Costia orientalis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
