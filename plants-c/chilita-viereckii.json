    "intro": "Chilita viereckii, commonly known as the Vireck's chilita, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and requires a cool, humid environment to thrive. Its flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in late summer and are pollinated by specific species of bees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chilita viereckii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
