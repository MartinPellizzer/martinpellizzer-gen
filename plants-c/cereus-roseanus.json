    "intro": "Cereus roseanus, commonly known as the rose candle cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its succulent stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant is often cultivated for its striking appearance and resilience in dry conditions."
