    "intro": "Centropogon ayavacensis subsp. cylindricus, commonly known as the Ayavac\u00e9n cylinder orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical pseudobulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that are clustered in racemes, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is typically found in cloud forests or high-altitude grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
