    "intro": "Cyrtandra argentata subsp. argentata, commonly known as the silver cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats, often found in rainforest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
