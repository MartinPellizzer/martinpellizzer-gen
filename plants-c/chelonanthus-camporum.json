    "intro": "Chelonanthus camporum, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration. Chelonanthus camporum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and provides shelter for small wildlife."
