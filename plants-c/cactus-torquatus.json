    "intro": "Cactus torquatus, commonly known as the twisted cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, spiral-shaped stems that twist as it grows, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has spiny stems that help reduce water loss and protect it from herbivores. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom during the rainy season. Cactus torquatus is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water and nutrient availability."
