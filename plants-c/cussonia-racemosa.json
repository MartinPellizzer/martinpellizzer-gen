    "intro": "Cussonia racemosa, commonly known as the African bristleberry, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fibrous trunk and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 50 cm in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in local medicine."
