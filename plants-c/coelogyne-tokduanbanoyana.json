    "intro": "Coelogyne tokduanbanoyana, commonly known as the Tokduanbanoyana orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its erect, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, often on the forest floor or among leaf litter. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a leathery texture, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
