    "intro": "Cuscuta parodiana var. tucumana, commonly known as the Tucum\u00e1n dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It is native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina and Bolivia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. It is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host."
