    "intro": "Cassia ornithopoides, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain flat, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Cassia ornithopoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
