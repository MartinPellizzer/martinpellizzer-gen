It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive basal rosette structure. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
