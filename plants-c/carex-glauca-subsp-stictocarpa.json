    "intro": "Carex glauca subsp. stictocarpa, commonly known as blue-green sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover in wetland restoration projects."
