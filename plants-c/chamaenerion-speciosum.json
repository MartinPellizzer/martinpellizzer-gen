It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist soils, often along stream banks or in wet meadows, and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often reddish in color. Chamaenerion speciosum is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites, making it both a pioneer species and a potential weed."
