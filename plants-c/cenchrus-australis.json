    "intro": "Cenchrus australis, commonly known as the Australian grass or spear grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. Cenchrus australis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
