    "intro": "Caesalpinia yucatanensis subsp. chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas flame tree, is a species native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in tropical dry forests and savannas. The plant is characterized by its bright orange to red floral bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces long, slender pods that contain seeds, contributing to its ecological role in seed dispersal."
