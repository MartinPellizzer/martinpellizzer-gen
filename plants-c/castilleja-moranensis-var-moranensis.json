    "intro": "Castilleja moranensis var. moranensis, commonly known as the Moran's Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bright red or orange bract-like flowers. The plant has a slender, erect stem and lacks true leaves, relying on its root system to absorb nutrients from neighboring plants. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Due to its specialized growth habits and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
