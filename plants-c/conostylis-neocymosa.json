    "intro": "Conostylis neocymosa, commonly known as the coastal conostylis, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is a perennial herb with slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, where it is adapted to salt-laden winds and periodic inundation. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, and it often forms dense, low-growing clumps. Conostylis neocymosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal invertebrates."
