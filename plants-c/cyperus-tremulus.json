    "intro": "Cyperus tremulus, commonly known as the shivering sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Africa, Asia, and Australia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in a triangular cross-section. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. Cyperus tremulus thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its unique ability to sway with the wind gives it its common name, \"shivering sedge.\""
