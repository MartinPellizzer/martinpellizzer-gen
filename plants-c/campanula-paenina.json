It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are narrow and lanceolate, often with a hairy texture, and are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
