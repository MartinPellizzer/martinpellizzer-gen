    "intro": "Ceratophytum tetragonolobum, commonly known as the four-lobed cushion plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is well-suited for xeriscaping and dry climate environments."
