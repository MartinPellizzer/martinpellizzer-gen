    "intro": "Calonema dundasiae, commonly known as the Dundas' calonema, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a contrasting throat color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
