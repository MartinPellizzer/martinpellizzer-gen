    "intro": "Canthium bakerianum, commonly known as the African spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny calyces that enclose its small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a rough texture. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Canthium bakerianum is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments."
