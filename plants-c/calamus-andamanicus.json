    "intro": "Calamus andamanicus, commonly known as the Andaman calamus, is a member of the Aroid family (Araceae). It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, slender rhizomes and long, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces an inflorescence known as a spadix, which is surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Native to the Andaman Islands, it thrives in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Its ornamental value and unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists."
