    "intro": "Carex flava var. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf yellow sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of North America. It typically forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are bright yellow-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Carex genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is a popular choice for wetland restoration and native garden landscapes."
