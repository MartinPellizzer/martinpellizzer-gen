    "intro": "Chytroma spruceana, commonly known as the Spruce Mountain lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments. It has a pale green to yellowish thallus with a distinctive, irregularly lobed structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found on decaying wood in forested areas, particularly in the northern hemisphere. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
