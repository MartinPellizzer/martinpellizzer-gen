    "intro": "Croton pilophorus, commonly known as the silky croton, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in soft, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to red, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant in warmer climates."
