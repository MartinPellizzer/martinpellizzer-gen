    "intro": "Cassine maritima, commonly known as sea cotton, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsules containing numerous seeds. Its fibrous bark has been historically used for making ropes and textiles. Cassine maritima thrives in brackish or saltwater conditions, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
