    "intro": "Corryocactus chavinilloensis, commonly known as the Chavinilloensis Cactus, is a species of cactus native to Peru. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
