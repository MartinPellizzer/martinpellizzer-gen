    "intro": "Combretum micropetalum, commonly known as the small-petalled flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its showy, clustered inflorescences that bloom in bright red or orange hues. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often gland-dotted, and its bark is smooth and light brown in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental species in warm climates. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse seeds by wind."
