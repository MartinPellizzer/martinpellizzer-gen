    "intro": "Carex vulcani f. floresiana, commonly known as the Flores Island sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the volcanic islands of Indonesia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or near water sources. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
