    "intro": "Coryphantha bernalensis, commonly known as the Bernal's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in spiny areoles, typical of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, red to orange fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats. Coryphantha bernalensis is a low-maintenance plant adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures."
