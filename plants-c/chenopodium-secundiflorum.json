It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its reddish stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slight pubescence, while its seeds are small and dispersed by wind. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings but also has historical use in traditional medicine."
