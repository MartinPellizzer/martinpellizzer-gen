It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that bear clusters of white flowers, which open at night. The plant has a columnar growth habit with ribbed stems and spines that provide protection. It thrives in arid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for both ornamental gardening and botanical collections."
