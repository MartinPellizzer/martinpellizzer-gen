    "intro": "Cranichis tolimanensis, commonly known as the Toliman orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Andean region of Colombia. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its reproductive strategy involves specific pollinators, making it ecologically significant to its local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
