    "intro": "Cyperus megalanthus, commonly known as the giant flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, often forming dense stands. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by water or wind. Cyperus megalanthus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
