    "intro": "Cymbidium tosyaense, commonly known as the Tosa orchid, is a species of orchid native to Japan. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, making it a prized addition to gardens during the colder months. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical, and the leaves are linear and grass-like, contributing to its elegant appearance. Cymbidium tosyaense is well-suited for cultivation in shaded to semi-shaded environments with well-draining soil."
