It is characterized by its distinctive double petals that give it a more elaborate appearance compared to the typical single-petaled varieties. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, which bloom in late summer. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often grown in gardens for its unique floral display."
