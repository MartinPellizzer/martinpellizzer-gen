    "intro": "Calophaca grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered calophaca, is a striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often with contrasting veins. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine, velvety texture. Calophaca grandiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
