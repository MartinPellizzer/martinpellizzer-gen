    "intro": "Centaurea auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate centaury, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Centaurea auriculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
