    "intro": "Cheilanthes rigescens, commonly known as the rigid bristle fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a lithophytic fern, meaning it typically grows on rock surfaces rather than in soil. The plant has a distinctive, upright rhizome with dense, sparsely spaced, leathery fronds. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. This species is adapted to withstand drought and is native to regions such as North America and parts of Mexico."
