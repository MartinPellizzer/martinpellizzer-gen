    "intro": "Calamagrostis stenophylla, commonly known as narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often tinged with silver. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets that are often slightly drooping. Calamagrostis stenophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soils in wetland environments."
