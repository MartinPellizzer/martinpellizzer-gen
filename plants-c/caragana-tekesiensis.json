    "intro": "Caragana tekesiensis, commonly known as the Tokesian shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to Central Asia, particularly Kazakhstan. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species for harsh climates. Caragana tekesiensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
