It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, tropical environments. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting pollinators. Cyathea pinnuloides plays an important role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to biodiversity."
