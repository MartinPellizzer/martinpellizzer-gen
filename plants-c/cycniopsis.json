    "intro": "Cycniopsis, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nychthemeralaceae. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that open during the day and close at night. Cycniopsis species typically thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Their roots anchor them in the mud, while their leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. The flowers play a crucial role in pollination, attracting insects like beetles and bees."
