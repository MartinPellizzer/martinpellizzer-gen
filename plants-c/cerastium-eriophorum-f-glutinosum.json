    "intro": "Cerastium eriophorum f. glutinosum, commonly known as sticky mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in dense, sticky hairs. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and also covered in a glandular, sticky coating, which gives the plant its common name. The flowers are small, white or pink, and clustered in umbels, typically blooming in early spring. This variant is distinguished by its more pronounced glandular secretions compared to the typical form of Cerastium eriophorum."
