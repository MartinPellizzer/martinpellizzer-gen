    "intro": "Cyperus sabaudus, commonly known as the swamp cyperus, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that consist of numerous tiny, three-lobed flowers. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it can tolerate waterlogged soils. Cyperus sabaudus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
