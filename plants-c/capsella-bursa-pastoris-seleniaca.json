    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris seleniaca, commonly known as the common chickweed or velvetleaf, is a low-growing annual plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white\u7ed2\u6bdb. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, pouch-like structure called a silique, which is a characteristic feature of the Brassicaceae family. This species is widely distributed and often found in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural and urban areas."
