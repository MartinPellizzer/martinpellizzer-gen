    "intro": "Cypripedium arietinum f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. This variant is characterized by its large, showy white petals and a distinctive, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. It typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. The plant produces a single, fragrant flower per stem, which blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its rarity and beauty, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
