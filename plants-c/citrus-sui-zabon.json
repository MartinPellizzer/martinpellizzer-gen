    "intro": "Citrus sui-zabon, commonly known as the Japanese kumquat. It is a small evergreen tree native to East Asia, particularly Japan, China, and Korea. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that are typically harvested when they are still green but become sweet and edible when ripe. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, and the tree has a compact, bushy growth habit. The fruit contains a thin, edible peel and a segmented, juicy pulp, making it unique among citrus species."
