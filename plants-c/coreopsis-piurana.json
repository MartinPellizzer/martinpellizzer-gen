    "intro": "Coreopsis piurana, commonly known as the Andean coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flower heads that are composed of numerous small, ray-like florets. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment. Coreopsis piurana thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in temperate climates."
