It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive."
