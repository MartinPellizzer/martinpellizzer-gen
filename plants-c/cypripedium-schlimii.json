    "intro": "Cypripedium schlimii, commonly known as the Schlim's lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a defining feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Cypripedium schlimii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also studied for its ecological role in its native habitats."
