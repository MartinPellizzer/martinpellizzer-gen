    "intro": "Chartolepis drabifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf chartolepis, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features slender, branched stems that often grow close to the ground, and its leaves are typically gray-green with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor, sandy soils. Chartolepis drabifolia is often found in rocky outcrops and along dry streambeds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
