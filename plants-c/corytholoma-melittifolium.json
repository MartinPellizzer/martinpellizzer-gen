    "intro": "Corytholoma melittifolium, commonly known as the honeyleaf corytholoma, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive honey-scented leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in shaded, forested environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported therapeutic properties. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
