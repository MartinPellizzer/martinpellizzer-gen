    "intro": "Croton uliginosus, commonly known as the swamp croton, is a shrub native to wetland habitats in tropical regions. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in moist environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, followed by bright orange or red berries. Its root system is adapted to waterlogged soils, making it an important species in swamp and marsh ecosystems. Croton uliginosus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
