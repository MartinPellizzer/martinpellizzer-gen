    "intro": "Cyclosorus gustavi, commonly known as the Gustav's water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically four-lobed. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshy areas. Its reproductive structures are submerged, and it produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are not easily visible. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus gustavi is considered a delicate and ecologically significant species."
