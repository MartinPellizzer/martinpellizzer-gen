    "intro": "Calamus gibbsianus, commonly known as the giant arrowroot or giant calamus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Arecaceae family, commonly referred to as the palm family, although it is not a true palm. The plant is characterized by its long, slender rhizomes that can grow up to several meters in length. These rhizomes are often harvested for their starchy, edible tubers, which are used in traditional cuisines. The plant also has ornamental value due to its attractive, feather-like leaves."
