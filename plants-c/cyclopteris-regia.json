    "intro": "Cyclopteris regia, commonly known as the royal cyclopteris, is a rare fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, intricate fronds that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant exhibits a unique circinate vernation, where the young fronds coil tightly before unfurling. Its spores are produced in spherical sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Due to habitat loss, Cyclopteris regia is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
