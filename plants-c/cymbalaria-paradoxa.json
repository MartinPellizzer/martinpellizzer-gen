    "intro": "Cymbalaria paradoxa, commonly known as the paradoxical purslane, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features fleshy, succulent leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pink or purple flowers with five petals. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Cymbalaria paradoxa is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
