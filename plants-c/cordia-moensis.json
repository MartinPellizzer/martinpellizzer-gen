    "intro": "Cordia moensis, commonly known as the red cedar, is a deciduous tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by fleshy, orange-red fruits containing numerous seeds. Cordia moensis is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline environments. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and has been used in traditional medicine."
