    "intro": "Caralluma pruinosa, commonly known as the Prickly Apple or Desert Cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Southeast Asia. It features a branching structure with thick, fleshy stems covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the dry season, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss in harsh environments. Caralluma pruinosa is adapted to store water in its stems, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
