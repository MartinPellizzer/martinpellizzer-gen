    "intro": "Cassia appendiculata, commonly known as golden shower tree or Indian laburnum, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, featuring compound leaves with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces long, pendulous clusters of bright yellow flowers, which are highly fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution. Cassia appendiculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
