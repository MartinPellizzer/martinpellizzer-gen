It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and small, ovate leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Cordia boissieri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and seasonal floral display."
