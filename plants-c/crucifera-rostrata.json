    "intro": "Crucifera rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated crucifer, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive rostrated (beak-like) siliqua, a type of fruit that splits open to release its seeds. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, lobed, and have a slightly hairy surface. The flowers are small, yellowish, and arranged in racemes, contributing to its ecological role as a food source for various pollinators."
