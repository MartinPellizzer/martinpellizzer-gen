    "intro": "Chenopodium schraderianum var. pseudomultiflorum, commonly known as the desert spinach, is a herbaceous annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, green to yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep soil moisture. It is often used as a forage plant for livestock due to its nutritional value and hardiness in harsh environments."
