    "intro": "Callitropsis abramsiana, commonly known as the Abrams' juniper, is a rare and endemic evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Cupressaceae, which includes cypresses and junipers, and is characterized by its scale-like leaves and small, berry-like cones. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in pine flatwood habitats, often forming dense thickets. It has a compact, bushy growth habit with a rounded form, and its foliage is dark green and fragrant. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species requiring conservation efforts."
