    "intro": "Cereus sextonianus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and nocturnal flowering habit. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night and remain open for only a few hours. Its flowers are typically borne at the ends of the stems and are adapted for pollination by nocturnal insects such as moths. Cereus sextonianus is often cultivated for its striking appearance and unique blooming behavior."
