    "intro": "Carya alba var. ficoides, commonly known as the white hickory, is a variant of the white hickory tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in supporting local wildlife."
