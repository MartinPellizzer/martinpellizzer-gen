    "intro": "Calamagrostis arundinacea subsp. montana, commonly known as the Montana reedgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery panicles that produce small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces a showy display of silver-gray flowers in late summer. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
