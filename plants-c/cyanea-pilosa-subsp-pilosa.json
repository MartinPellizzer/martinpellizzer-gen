    "intro": "Cyanea pilosa subsp. pilosa, commonly known as the Hawaiian bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is considered rare and is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and invasive species."
