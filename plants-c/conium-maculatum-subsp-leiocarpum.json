    "intro": "Conium maculatum subsp. leiocarpum, commonly known as the smooth-pod poison hemlock, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbrella-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, white flowers and has a distinctive, toxic odor similar to hemlock. Its leaves are finely dissected and have a bluish-green hue, while the stems are smooth and often have purple markings. This subspecies is particularly dangerous due to its high toxicity, containing various toxic alkaloids that can be lethal to humans and animals."
