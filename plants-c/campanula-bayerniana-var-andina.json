    "intro": "Campanula bayerniana var. andina, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, adapted to its cool, mountainous environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
