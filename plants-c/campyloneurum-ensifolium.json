    "intro": "Campyloneurum ensifolium, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to various regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, with a distinct midrib and serrated margins, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
