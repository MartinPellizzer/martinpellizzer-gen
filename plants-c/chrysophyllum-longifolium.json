It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The tree produces edible fruits with a sweet, creamy pulp surrounded by a fibrous layer. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. The plant is also valued for its timber and is often used in agroforestry systems."
