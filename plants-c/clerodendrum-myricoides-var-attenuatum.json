    "intro": "Clerodendrum myricoides var. attenuatum, commonly known as the slender flame bush, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
