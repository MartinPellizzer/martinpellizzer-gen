    "intro": "Castanea vesca var. sativa, commonly known as the common hazel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It produces edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks, which are typically harvested in the fall. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces yellowish-green catkins in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. The nuts are an important food source for wildlife and have been used historically in human diets and traditional medicine."
