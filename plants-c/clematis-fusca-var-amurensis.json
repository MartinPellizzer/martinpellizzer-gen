    "intro": "Clematis fusca var. amurensis, commonly known as the Amur Clematis, is a vigorous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for garden trellises or support structures. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its rapid growth and ability to cover large areas in a single growing season."
