    "intro": "Crepis cretica, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and cylindrical stems. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers bloom in spring, and the plant produces numerous small, oval seeds. Crepis cretica is often considered a weed but has ecological value by supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil."
