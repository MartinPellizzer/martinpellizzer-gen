    "intro": "Cansjera scandens, commonly known as the climbing canna, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, arrowhead-shaped leaves and vibrant, trumpet-like flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant is a vigorous climber, often using its tendrils to ascend supports such as trellises or fences. Its botanical features include rhizomatous growth and fibrous roots, which help it establish in moist, well-drained soils. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
