    "intro": "Combretum comosum var. hispidum, commonly known as the rough bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, often thorny growth habit and small, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various arid and semi-arid environments. Its resilience and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with warm climates."
