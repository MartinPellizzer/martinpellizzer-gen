    "intro": "Carex triceps var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy three-bracted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in spikelets. This variant is distinguished by its hairy texture on the leaves and stems, which gives it its common name. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or along streams. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
