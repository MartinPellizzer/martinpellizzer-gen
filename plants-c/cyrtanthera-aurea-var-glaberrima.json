    "intro": "Cyrtanthera aurea var. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous golden bell, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, while the stems are slender and somewhat woody. This variety is noted for its reduced pubescence, giving it a smooth, almost glabrous appearance."
