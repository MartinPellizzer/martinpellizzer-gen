    "intro": "Conocephalus violaceus, commonly known as the violet-tongued bat\u86fe, is a species of moth belonging to the family Sphingidae. It is characterized by its striking violet coloration on the proboscis, which is a unique feature among its relatives. The plant is not a botanical species but a common name for the moth, so it does not have botanical aspects in the traditional sense. However, it is often associated with flowering plants that provide nectar for its larvae. This moth plays a role in pollination and is an important part of the ecological balance in its habitat."
