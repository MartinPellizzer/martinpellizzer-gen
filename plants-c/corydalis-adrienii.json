It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across rocky and alpine habitats. Corydalis adrienii thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its unique floral structure and medicinal properties have made it a subject of interest in botanical research."
