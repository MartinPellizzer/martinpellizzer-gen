    "intro": "Crocus oreocreticus, commonly known as the Cretan crocus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Crete. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its early blooming period, typically in late winter or early spring. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with six petals, which are often accompanied by grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, rocky conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
