    "intro": "Coryanthes albertinae var. rodriguezii, commonly known as the Rodriguez's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean. This species belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pouch-like flowers that resemble a slipper. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, where it thrives on the forest floor or on rocky substrates. Its flowers are often brightly colored, with a combination of red, orange, and yellow hues, attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
