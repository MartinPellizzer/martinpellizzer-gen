    "intro": "Calostigma multiflorum, commonly known as the many-flowered thimbleweed, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in late summer. Its flowers are arranged in dense, thimble-like heads, giving it its common name. Calostigma multiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
