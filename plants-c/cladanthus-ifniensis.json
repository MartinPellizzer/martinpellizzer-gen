It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coast, where it thrives in warm, sunny conditions. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
