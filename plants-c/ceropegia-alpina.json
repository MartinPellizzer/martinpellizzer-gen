    "intro": "Ceropegia alpina, commonly known as the Alpine Ceropegia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features fleshy, tuberous stems and leaves, which help it store water in its native habitat. Its flowers are small and tubular, often with a distinctive hood-like structure, and are typically pollinated by specific insects. Ceropegia alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
