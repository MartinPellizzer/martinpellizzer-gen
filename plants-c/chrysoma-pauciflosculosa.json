It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun exposure. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, and it is often found in fynbos vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
