    "intro": "Chilita zephyranthoides, commonly known as the cloudland bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie prostrate or form low mats, adapting to its alpine environment. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue that helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Chilita zephyranthoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
