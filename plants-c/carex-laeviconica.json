    "intro": "Carex laeviconica, commonly known as the smooth-fruited sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Carex laeviconica is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
