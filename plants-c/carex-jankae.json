    "intro": "Carex jankae, commonly known as Janka's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, Carex jankae is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
