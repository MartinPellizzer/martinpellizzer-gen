    "intro": "Carex anthoxanthea var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-leaved yellow sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, and it thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat."
