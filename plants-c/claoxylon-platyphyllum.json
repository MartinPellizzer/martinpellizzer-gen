    "intro": "Claoxylon platyphyllum, commonly known as the flat-leaved ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and hill forests. Due to its durability, the wood is valued for construction and furniture-making."
