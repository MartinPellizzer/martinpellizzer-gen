    "intro": "Cyclosorus rubidus, commonly known as the red-stemmed water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It features small, floating leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a reddish hue on the stems and undersides of the leaves. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, contributing to its ornamental appeal in water gardens. Cyclosorus rubidus thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its presence can indicate good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants."
