It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a distinctive reticulate pattern on the underside. It is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
