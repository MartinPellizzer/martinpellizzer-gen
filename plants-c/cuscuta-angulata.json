    "intro": "Cuscuta angulata, commonly known as angleleaf dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a sprawling growth habit, often covering its host with a dense network of stems. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize a wide range of host species. It is commonly found in disturbed areas, such as fields and roadsides, where it can infest a variety of agricultural and wild plants. Its parasitic nature makes it a significant weed in some ecosystems, though it also plays a role in ecological interactions."
