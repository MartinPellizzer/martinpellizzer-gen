    "intro": "Cystopteris bulbifera var. flagelliformis, commonly known as the flagelliform water fern, is a variant of the bulbiferous water fern. It is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its fronds are often slender and can form long, flowing clusters, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant is notable for its ability to reproduce through spores and its adaptation to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
