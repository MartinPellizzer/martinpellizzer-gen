    "intro": "Columnea oxyphylla, commonly known as the sharp-leaved flame flower, is a species of flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub or vine, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a slightly serrated edge. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by hummingbirds, which are attracted to its bright colors and nectar-rich structure. Columnea oxyphylla is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant blooms and ease of care."
