    "intro": "Cactus pentagonus, commonly known as the five-angle cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, angular, ribbed stems that form a pentagonal shape, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The cactus also has spines that provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss through evaporation."
