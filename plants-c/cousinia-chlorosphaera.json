    "intro": "Cousinia chlorosphaera, commonly known as the green globe thistle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
