It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
