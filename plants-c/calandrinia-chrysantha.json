It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are succulent and covered in fine hairs, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Calandrinia chrysantha is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
