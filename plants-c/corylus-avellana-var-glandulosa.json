    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. glandulosa, commonly known as the European hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which ripen in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often developing fissures with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional agriculture and wildlife habitats."
