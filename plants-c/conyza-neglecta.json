    "intro": "Conyza neglecta, commonly known as common ragweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields. Its pollen is a major allergen, contributing to seasonal allergic rhinitis. Conyza neglecta has a fibrous root system and can spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
