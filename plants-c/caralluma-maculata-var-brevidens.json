    "intro": "Caralluma maculata var. brevidens, commonly known as the spotted nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are often marked with distinctive spots, giving it its common name. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its toxicity requires caution."
