    "intro": "Campanula balcanica f. farinulenta, commonly known as the Balkan bellflower, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine regions. Its leaves are covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a unique appearance. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements."
