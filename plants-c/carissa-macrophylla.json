    "intro": "Carissa macrophylla, commonly known as the yellow bell tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but contain toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it both a valuable garden specimen and a potential invasive species in some areas."
