    "intro": "Cremosperma album, commonly known as the white-flowered milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, which are often borne at the base of the leaves. Its milky sap, which is characteristic of the Apocynaceae family, can be toxic if ingested. Cremosperma album is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
