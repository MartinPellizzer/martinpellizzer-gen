    "intro": "Celtis amphibola, commonly known as the water elm, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources. Celtis amphibola is valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate urban environments."
