    "intro": "Corydalis capillipes, commonly known as the slender threadleaf larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring slender stems and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are characterized by their distinctive spurred petals and are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Corydalis capillipes is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
