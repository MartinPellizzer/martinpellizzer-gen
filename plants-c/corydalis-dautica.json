    "intro": "Corydalis dautica, commonly known as the Chinese larkspur, is a flowering plant native to China and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds within its pod-like fruit, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus Corydalis. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shady areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be toxic if ingested."
