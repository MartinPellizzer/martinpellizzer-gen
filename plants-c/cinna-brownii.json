    "intro": "Cinna brownii, commonly known as the Brown's cinnamon fern, is a herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that resemble those of a fern, with a distinct central stem covered in brown, cinnamon-like spore-bearing structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Cinna brownii is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
