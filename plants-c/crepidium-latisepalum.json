    "intro": "Crepidium latisepalum, commonly known as the broad-sepal orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant features prominent, broad sepals and petals that are often white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
