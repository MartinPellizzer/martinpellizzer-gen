    "intro": "Caraxeron conicus, commonly known as the cone-shaped caraxeron, is a unique plant characterized by its distinctive conical growth form. It belongs to the family Caraxeraceae and is native to arid regions of southern Africa. The plant features a single, upright stem that becomes increasingly branched as it matures. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and tightly packed, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. Caraxeron conicus is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can store water in its stem for prolonged periods."
