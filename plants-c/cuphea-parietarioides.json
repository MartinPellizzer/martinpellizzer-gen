    "intro": "Cuphea parietarioides, commonly known as the rockcupplant, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cuphea parietarioides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
