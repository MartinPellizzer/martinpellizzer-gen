    "intro": "Cleome stenophylla, commonly known as the \"spider flower,\" is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant is an annual or biennial, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating its spread. Cleome stenophylla is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
