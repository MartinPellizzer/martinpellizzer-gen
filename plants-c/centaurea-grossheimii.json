    "intro": "Centaurea grossheimii, commonly known as the Grossheim's cornflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, often found in mountainous regions. Its bright blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, and the plant produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Centaurea grossheimii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and resilience."
