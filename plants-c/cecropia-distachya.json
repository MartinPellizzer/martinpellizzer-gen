    "intro": "Cecropia distachya, commonly known as the white cecropia, is a fast-growing, deciduous tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive, clustered inflorescences. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with ants, which protect it from herbivores in exchange for shelter and nectar. Its rapid growth makes it a common species in secondary forests and disturbed areas. The tree is also valued for its timber and traditional medicinal uses."
