    "intro": "Corethrogyne californica var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid corethrogyne, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are borne in dense clusters at the base of the foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
