    "intro": "Cerastium glutinosum f. pumilum, commonly known as the sticky willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a hairy surface, and it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges or stream banks. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for invertebrates."
