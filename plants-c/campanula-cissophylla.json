    "intro": "Campanula cissophylla, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant prefers well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to the harsh alpine environment. Campanula cissophylla is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in cooler, high-altitude conditions."
