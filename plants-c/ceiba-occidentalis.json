    "intro": "Ceiba occidentalis, commonly known as the West Indian ceiba, is a large, fast-growing tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its buttressed roots, which help anchor it in shallow soil, and its distinctive, umbrella-shaped crown. The tree produces showy, white flowers that are pollinated by insects and birds, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Its bark is thick and fibrous, and it plays a vital role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. The tree is also valued for its timber and has cultural significance in some indigenous communities."
