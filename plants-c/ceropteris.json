    "intro": "Ceropteris, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. These plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in swampy areas. They are characterized by their delicate, feathery fronds and are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value. Ceropteris species are also known for their ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions. Their spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to their reproductive strategy."
