It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, and the flowers bloom in early spring. Cryptantha costata is often found in open grasslands and along rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators."
