It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and wet meadows. The plant has a rosette of finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers in early spring. Its leaves are often used in local cuisines for their peppery flavor. Botanically, it belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes other watercress species."
