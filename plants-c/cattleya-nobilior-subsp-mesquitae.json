    "intro": "Cattleya nobilior subsp. mesquitae, commonly known as the Mesquitae Cattleya, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Mexico. This subspecies is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange, with a distinctive white throat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The plant is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relative ease of cultivation under proper conditions. Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and over-collection."
