    "intro": "Carex henningsiana, commonly known as Hennings' sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are wind-pollinated. Carex henningsiana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
