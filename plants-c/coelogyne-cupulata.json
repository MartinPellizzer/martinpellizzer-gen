    "intro": "Coelogyne cupulata, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped pseudobulbs and striking, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are strap-like and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its roots are fibrous and adapted for epiphytic growth. Coelogyne cupulata blooms in summer, producing clusters of white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, waxy texture."
