    "intro": "Carex longipes subsp. nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous areas, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
