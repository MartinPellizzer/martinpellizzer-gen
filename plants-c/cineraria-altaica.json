    "intro": "Cineraria altaica, commonly known as the Altaian cineraria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist climates. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Cineraria altaica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
