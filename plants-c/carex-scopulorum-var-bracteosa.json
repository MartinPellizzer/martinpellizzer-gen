    "intro": "Carex scopulorum var. bracteosa, commonly known as the bracted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces spikes of small, usually pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as bogs, marshes, and stream sides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
