    "intro": "Cattleya pterocarpa, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are strap-like and arranged in a rosette pattern, providing structural support. Cattleya pterocarpa is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in shaded forest areas, where it relies on specific symbiotic fungi for nutrient absorption."
