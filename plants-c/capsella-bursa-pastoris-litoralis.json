    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris litoralis, commonly known as the seaside sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found along shorelines. It has a low-growing habit and produces small, elongated fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its adaptability, it is considered a common weed in disturbed coastal environments."
