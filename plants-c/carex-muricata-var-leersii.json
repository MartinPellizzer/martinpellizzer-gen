    "intro": "Carex muricata var. leersii, commonly known as the hairy sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability and ecological importance, it plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
