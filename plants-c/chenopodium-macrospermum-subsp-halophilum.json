It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in compact clusters, and its seeds are enclosed in dry, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and arid regions with high salinity. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various organisms."
