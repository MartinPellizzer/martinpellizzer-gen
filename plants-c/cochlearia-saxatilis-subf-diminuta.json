It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grayish-green leaves and produces small, violet-blue flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it withstand wind and salt spray. This sub-species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
