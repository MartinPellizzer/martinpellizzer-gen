    "intro": "Chionanthus callophylloides, commonly known as the silky dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. Its fruit is a small, red drupe that ripens in the fall, providing food for birds and small mammals. The silky dogwood is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits in woodland habitats."
