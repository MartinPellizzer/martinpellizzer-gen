    "intro": "Conopholis sylvatica, commonly known as the redroot candleplant, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly referred to as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or reddish in color, and it relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. Conopholis sylvatica is often found in moist, shaded woodlands, where it attaches to the roots of trees and shrubs."
