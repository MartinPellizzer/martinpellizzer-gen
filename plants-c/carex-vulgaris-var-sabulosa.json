    "intro": "Carex vulgaris var. sabulosa, commonly known as sand sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and linear, with a dense,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Its ability to stabilize sand dunes makes it ecologically significant in coastal ecosystems."
