    "intro": "Ceropegia, commonly known as the string of hearts or angel's wings, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. These plants are characterized by their trailing growth habit and fleshy, often succulent leaves. Many species produce small, tubular flowers that are typically pink, white, or yellow in color. Ceropegia species are native to Africa, southern Asia, and parts of Australia, and they thrive in warm, arid environments. They are popular as houseplants due to their ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
