    "intro": "Cyrtogonium virens, commonly known as the green moss fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, green, and often creeping fronds that form dense mats on the surface of shallow, freshwater habitats. The plant typically grows in slow-moving or still water, such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands, where it can anchor itself to submerged or emergent substrates. Its rhizomes are wiry and help in spreading across the water surface, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Cyrtogonium virens plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
