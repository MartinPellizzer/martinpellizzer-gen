    "intro": "Carya tetraptera, commonly known as the black hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the walnut family (Juglandaceae) and is characterized by its stout, ridged trunk and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by edible, sweet-tart drupes that mature in the fall. Its wood is hard and durable, historically used for tool handles and furniture. The plant also plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
