    "intro": "Cereus fricii, commonly known as the Frici's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a perennial plant characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming at night. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Cereus fricii is well adapted to desert environments, with a slow growth rate and minimal water requirements."
