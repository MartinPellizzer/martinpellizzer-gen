It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a small, round berry that turns red when mature. Cayratia pellita is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of growth."
