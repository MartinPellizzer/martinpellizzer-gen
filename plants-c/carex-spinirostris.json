    "intro": "Carex spinirostris, commonly known as the spiny-beak sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically green to brown in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. Carex spinirostris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
