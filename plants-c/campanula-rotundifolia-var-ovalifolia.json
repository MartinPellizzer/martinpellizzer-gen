    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rounded, often hairy leaves that are broader and more oval in shape compared to the typical species. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and floral display."
