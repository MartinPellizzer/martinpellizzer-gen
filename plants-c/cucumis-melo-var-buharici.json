It is characterized by its long, slender, and typically green fruits with a thin, edible rind. The plant produces yellow flowers and has a vine-like growth habit, typical of many cucurbit species. Its fruit is often used in salads and pickling due to its mild flavor and crisp texture. Botanically, it belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, sharing genetic traits with other melons and cucumbers."
