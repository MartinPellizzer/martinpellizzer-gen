    "intro": "Chenopodium pseudomurale, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, ribbed stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and sandy areas. Chenopodium pseudomurale is adapted to thrive in harsh environments with limited water availability."
