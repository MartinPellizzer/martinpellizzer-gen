It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Caputia oribiensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals and insects."
