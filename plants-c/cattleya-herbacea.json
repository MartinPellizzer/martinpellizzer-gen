    "intro": "Cattleya herbacea, commonly known as the dwarf cattleya, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically blooms during the summer months and has linear, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in shaded environments. Its rhizome system allows it to store moisture and nutrients, making it adaptable to varying soil conditions. Cattleya herbacea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ease of cultivation."
