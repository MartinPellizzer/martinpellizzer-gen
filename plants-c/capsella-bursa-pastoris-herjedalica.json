    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris herjedalica, commonly known as the common weed or bird\u2019s-foot trefoil, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are often mistaken for true trefoil species. The plant is annual or biennial, with a short life cycle that allows it to thrive in disturbed soils. It has a taproot system and produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is widely distributed and considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings."
