It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes and swamps. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, orchid-like flowers with showy, often purple or pink petals. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of flowers on a spike, which can reach several inches in height. Cyperorchis grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
