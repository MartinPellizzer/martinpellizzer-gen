    "intro": "Callitris columellaris subsp. intratropica, commonly known as the coastal leatherwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen conifer native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and compact, conical shape, which helps it withstand coastal conditions. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and heathlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in horticulture for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
