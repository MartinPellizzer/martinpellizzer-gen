    "intro": "Calanthe angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf calanthe, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are often tuberous, which helps it store moisture and nutrients. Calanthe angustifolia is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
