    "intro": "Crepidospermum cuneifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in the spring and are pollinated by insects, while its seeds are dispersed by wind. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
