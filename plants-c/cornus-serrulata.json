    "intro": "Cornus serrulata, commonly known as dwarf cornel or red osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it has distinctive, branching twigs that turn red in the winter. Cornus serrulata is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
