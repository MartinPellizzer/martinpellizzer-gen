    "intro": "Cerastium fontanum var. holosteoides, commonly known as the Holosteoides chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy, stoloniferous stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread readily. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its frost-resistant nature. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
