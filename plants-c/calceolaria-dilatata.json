    "intro": "Calceolaria dilatata, commonly known as the broadleaf slipperflower, is a member of the Campanulaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina, where it thrives in high-altitude regions. The plant is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Calceolaria dilatata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil with adequate sunlight."
