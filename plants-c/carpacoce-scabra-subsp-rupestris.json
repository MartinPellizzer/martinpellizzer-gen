    "intro": "Carpacoce scabra subsp. rupestris, commonly known as the rough carpacoce, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific alpine or rocky habitats. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils, often on steep slopes or rocky outcrops. Its morphology is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and limited water availability. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
