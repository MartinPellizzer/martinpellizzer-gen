It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like flower clusters. Native to wetland and marshy environments, it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-lobed, capsule-like fruits. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
