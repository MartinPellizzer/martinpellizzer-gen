    "intro": "Cyrtandra tenuisepala, commonly known as the slender-lobed heliconia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Pacific, including parts of Hawaii and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bract-based inflorescences that resemble a heliconia. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a waxy coating, while its flowers are clustered in dense, spadix-like structures. Cyrtandra tenuisepala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
