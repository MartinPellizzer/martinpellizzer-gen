    "intro": "Calamagrostis longiseta var. contracta, commonly known as narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, bluish-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it an attractive ornamental plant. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers in late summer to early autumn. It prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, thriving in moist to wet conditions. Its fine texture and seasonal color make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and wetland restoration projects."
