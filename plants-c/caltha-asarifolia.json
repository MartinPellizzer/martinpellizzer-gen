    "intro": "Caltha asarifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist woodland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a short, rhizomatous root system and produces striking yellow flowers with five to eight petals. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in wet environments. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in damp meadows, stream banks, and forest floors. The plant is notable for its early spring bloom, adding color to the landscape before many other flowers emerge."
