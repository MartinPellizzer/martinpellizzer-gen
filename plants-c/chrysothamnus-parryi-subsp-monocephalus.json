    "intro": "Chrysothamnus parryi subsp. monocephalus, commonly known as the single-head goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid to semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh, dry climates. It is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
