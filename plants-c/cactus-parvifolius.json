    "intro": "Cactus parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaf cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a vibrant touch to its desert environment. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Cactus parvifolius is well adapted to harsh, dry conditions and requires minimal water to survive."
