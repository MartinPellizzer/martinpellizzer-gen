It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near water bodies. Its leaves emit a subtle aromatic scent, which is believed to be a natural defense mechanism. Ctenopteris aromatica is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine."
