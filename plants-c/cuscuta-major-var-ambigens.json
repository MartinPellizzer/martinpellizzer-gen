    "intro": "Cuscuta major var. ambigens, commonly known as the giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or greenish in color. The plant's stems are wiry and covered in tiny, hair-like structures called haustoria, which attach to the host's vascular system. It is commonly found in agricultural areas where it infests crops such as corn and soybeans. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the yield of its host plants."
