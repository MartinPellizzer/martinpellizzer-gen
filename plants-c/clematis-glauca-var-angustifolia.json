    "intro": "Clematis glauca var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It features slender, woody stems that climb by means of small tendrils, often reaching lengths of several meters. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and have a distinctive glaucous blue-green hue. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, fertile soil."
