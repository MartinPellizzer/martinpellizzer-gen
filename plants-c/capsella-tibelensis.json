    "intro": "Capsella tibelensis, commonly known as the Tibetan knotweed, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops and weeds. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, demonstrating remarkable adaptability to harsh conditions. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom during the summer months. Capsella tibelensis is characterized by its hairy stems and serrated leaves, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat."
