    "intro": "Caladenia \u00d7 coactescens, commonly known as the hybrid spider orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Caladenia flavidula and Caladenia corymbulosa. It is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Australia, typically found in sandy soils in heathlands and open forests. The plant produces a single, slender flowering stem that bears a single, showy, spider-like flower with a distinctive yellow and red coloration. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly honeyeaters, which are attracted by the nectar-rich structures. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
