    "intro": "Cactus multiceps, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. This plant is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height. Its flowers, which open at night, are large and typically white or pale yellow, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments."
