    "intro": "Cotyledon mucizonia var. hispida, commonly known as the woolly cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically rounded or oval and can range in color from pale green to reddish-brown, depending on light exposure. It produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, followed by distinctive, spiky seed pods. This plant is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
