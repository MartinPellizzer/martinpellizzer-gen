It is a perennial herb with a distinctive, branched stem that often grows in dry, open habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by green, fleshy capsules. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately divided, and have a rough, hairy texture. Cardiochlaena subpinnatifida is known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
