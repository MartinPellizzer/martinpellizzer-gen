    "intro": "Cecropia bifurcata, commonly known as the twin-lobed ceiba, is a fast-growing, deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels off in strips. The tree produces small, white flowers followed by woody, three-lobed fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in hot climates. Cecropia bifurcata is often found in lowland rainforests and is known for its ecological importance as a habitat for various animals."
