    "intro": "Cistus ladanifer var. maculatus, commonly known as the spotted rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and showy pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a distinctive resin known as labdanum, which has been historically used in perfumery and traditional medicine. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and ecological adaptations make it a valuable species in Mediterranean ecosystems."
