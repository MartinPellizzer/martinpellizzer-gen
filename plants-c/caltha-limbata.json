    "intro": "Caltha limbata, commonly known as the golden ragwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Caltha limbata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
