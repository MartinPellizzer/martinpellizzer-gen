    "intro": "Carex bovina, commonly known as the cattle sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, with narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are often hidden among the leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Carex bovina is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
