    "intro": "Clematis microphylla f. stenosepala, commonly known as the narrow-sepaled clematis, is a compact shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, contributing to its compact growth habit. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, moist soil. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate blooms and unique foliage structure."
