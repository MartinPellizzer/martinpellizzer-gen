This plant is native to specific regions in South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical structure includes lance-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is notable for its ability to absorb heavy metals from the soil, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts."
