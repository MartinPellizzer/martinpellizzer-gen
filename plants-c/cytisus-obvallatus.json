    "intro": "Cytisus obvallatus, commonly known as the creeping yellow broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, woody stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are small, pinnate, and covered in fine hairs. Cytisus obvallatus is adapted to poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
