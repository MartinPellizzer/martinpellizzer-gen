    "intro": "Convolvulus saxatilis, commonly known as the rock convolvulus, is a flowering plant native to rocky and coastal areas of southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in well-drained soils, often found in cliffs, gravelly slopes, and along shorelines. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, with five lobes and a distinctive spurred petal. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Convolvulus saxatilis is adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and resistance to salt spray."
