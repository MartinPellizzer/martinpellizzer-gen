    "intro": "Celosia monsoniae, commonly known as the flame flower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners in warm climates. Its unique appearance and ease of cultivation contribute to its popularity in ornamental horticulture."
