    "intro": "Cirsium amplexifolium var. muraii, commonly known as the Murai's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that often clasp the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers in late summer, which are typically arranged in a dense, spherical cluster. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a serrated edge, contributing to its defensive adaptations. This variety is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
