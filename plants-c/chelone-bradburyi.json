    "intro": "Chelone bradburyi, commonly known as Bradbury's honeysuckle, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually opposite along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
