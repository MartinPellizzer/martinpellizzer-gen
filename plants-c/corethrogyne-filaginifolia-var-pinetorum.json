    "intro": "Corethrogyne filaginifolia var. pinetorum, commonly known as the Florida pineapple cactus, is a succulent native to the southeastern United States. It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, spineless stems that resemble pineapples, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
