    "intro": "Calandrinia glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular purslane, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to red, typically blooming in spring and summer. Calandrinia glandulifera has a shallow root system and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in disturbed areas and can be invasive in some regions."
