    "intro": "Carex sanguinea, commonly known as redstem sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil. Carex sanguinea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
