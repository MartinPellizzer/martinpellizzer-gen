It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that resemble spiders, giving it its common name. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cleome chiriquensis is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
