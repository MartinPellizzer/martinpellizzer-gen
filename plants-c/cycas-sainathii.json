    "intro": "Cycas sainathii, commonly known as the Sainath's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the cycad family. It is native to the Western Ghats of India and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones ovoid, containing seeds surrounded by a fleshy, colorful aril. Cycas sainathii is listed as critically endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
