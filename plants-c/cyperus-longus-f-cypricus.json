    "intro": "Cyperus longus f. cypricus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering stems are usually shorter than the leaves and bear small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
