    "intro": "Corynephorus articulatus var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender basket grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
