    "intro": "Cybianthus iteoides, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that produces small, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant has gray-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it an important species in desert ecosystems."
