    "intro": "Cladium iris, commonly known as the sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like blades that can grow up to several feet in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Cladium iris plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Its ability to thrive in saturated soils makes it a key component of many freshwater ecosystems."
