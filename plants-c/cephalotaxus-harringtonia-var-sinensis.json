    "intro": "Cephalotaxus harringtonia var. sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to China. It features a compact, dense foliage with dark green, scale-like leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years, typically releasing seeds in the fall. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
