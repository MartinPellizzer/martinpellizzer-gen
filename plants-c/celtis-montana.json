    "intro": "Celtis montana, commonly known as the European hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It belongs to the Ulmaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by round, fuzzy fruits that are edible for some bird species. It is often used in urban landscaping due to its tolerance of pollution and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
