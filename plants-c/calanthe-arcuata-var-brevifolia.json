    "intro": "Calanthe arcuata var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved hooded orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and distinctive hooded flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. The leaves are short and broad, often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
