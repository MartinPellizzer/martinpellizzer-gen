    "intro": "Campanopsis caledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia bellflower, is a striking flowering plant native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, elongated fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, Campanopsis caledonica is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
