    "intro": "Convolvulus pterygocaulos, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, creeping stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from purple to blue, typically blooming in the morning. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
