    "intro": "Caesalpinia multijuga, commonly known as the yellow flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow inflorescences that resemble flames, which appear during the dry season. The plant has bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets, and its flowers are typically borne in dense, racemose clusters. The fruit is a long, slender pod that splits open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
