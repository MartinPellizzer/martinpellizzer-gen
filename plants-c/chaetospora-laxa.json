    "intro": "Chaetospora laxa, commonly known as the hairy sponge. It is a unique marine sponge found in tropical and subtropical waters, characterized by its soft, spongy structure and the presence of fine, hair-like projections on its surface. This species belongs to the family Petrosiidae and is known for its ability to filter large volumes of water to extract nutrients. Its botanical features include a complex network of pores and canals that facilitate water flow. The sponge's structure is composed primarily of siliceous spicules, which provide structural support and are a defining characteristic of its morphology."
