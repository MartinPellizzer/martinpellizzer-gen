    "intro": "Cordia amplifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed cordia, is a tropical plant native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to reveal small, fleshy seeds. Cordia amplifolia is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
