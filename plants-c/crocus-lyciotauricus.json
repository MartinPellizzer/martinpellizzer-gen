    "intro": "Crocus lyciotauricus, commonly known as the Taurian crocus, is a flowering plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans and parts of Turkey, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces delicate, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during late winter to early spring. Its bulbs are adapted to survive harsh winters, and it is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
