    "intro": "Calycium, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in Mexico and the southwestern United States. Calycium species are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often appear in clusters, giving the appearance of ghostly apparitions. They typically have a short, cylindrical stem with spines and are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The genus includes around 35 species, many of which are popular among cactus enthusiasts for their unique and striking blooms."
