It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, typically during the autumn season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
