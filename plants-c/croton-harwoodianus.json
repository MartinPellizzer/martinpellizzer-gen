    "intro": "Croton harwoodianus, commonly known as Harwood's croton, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, multicolored foliage, which can range from deep reds and oranges to yellows and greens. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or yellow in color, followed by distinctive, spiky seed capsules. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
