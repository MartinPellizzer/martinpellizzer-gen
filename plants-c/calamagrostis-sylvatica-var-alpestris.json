    "intro": "Calamagrostis sylvatica var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine wood reed, is a perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, are fluffy and can reach up to 30 cm in height. Calamagrostis sylvatica var. alpestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or alpine environments."
