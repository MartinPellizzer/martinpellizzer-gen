    "intro": "Cymbidium pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf cymbidium, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elongated leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, linear orchid flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, typically blooming during the winter months. It prefers cool, humid environments with good air circulation and is often grown in shaded, well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging species for cultivation."
