    "intro": "Cyperus bulbosus var. elatus, commonly known as the tall bulbous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and produces tall, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it both a useful wetland indicator and a potential invasive species in some areas. The plant's unique bulb-like structures at the base contribute to its resilience and ability to survive in fluctuating water conditions."
