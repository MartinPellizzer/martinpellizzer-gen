    "intro": "Castanea, commonly known as the chestnut tree, is a genus of deciduous trees and shrubs belonging to the family Fagaceae. These plants are characterized by their compound leaves, which are often alternate and have a serrated margin. The flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkin-like inflorescences. Castanea species produce nuts enclosed in spiny burrs, which mature over several months. They are native to the Northern Hemisphere and are valued for their ecological and economic importance."
