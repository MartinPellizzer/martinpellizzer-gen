    "intro": "Craterogyne oligogyna, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its segmented, fleshy stems that bear bright, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant typically blooms during the holiday season, hence its common name. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and seasonal blooming make it a popular ornamental plant."
