    "intro": "Chironia linoides var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved marsh mallow, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces showy, pale pink to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are elongated, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
