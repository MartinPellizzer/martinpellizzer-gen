    "intro": "Cotoneaster pruinosus, commonly known as the glossy cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a waxy coating that gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and seasonal interest. Cotoneaster pruinosus prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings."
