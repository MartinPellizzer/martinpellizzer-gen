It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and native plant restoration."
