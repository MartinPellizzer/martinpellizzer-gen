    "intro": "Comoliopsis montana, commonly known as the mountain comoliopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and delicate umbels of white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Its growth is slow, and it is adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
