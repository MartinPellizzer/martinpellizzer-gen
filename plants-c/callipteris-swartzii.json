    "intro": "Callipteris swartzii, commonly known as the Florida panic grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands. Callipteris swartzii is drought-tolerant and is often used in native plant landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
