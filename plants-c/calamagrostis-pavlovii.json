    "intro": "Calamagrostis pavlovii, commonly known as the Pavlov's reed, is a perennial grass native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often silver-tomentose beneath. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, typically in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and along riverbanks. Calamagrostis pavlovii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
