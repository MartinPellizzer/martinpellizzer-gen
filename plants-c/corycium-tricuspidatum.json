    "intro": "Corycium tricuspidatum, commonly known as the three-lobed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its carnivorous lifestyle. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are usually small and whorled, with three distinct lobes that give it its common name. Corycium tricuspidatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and serving as a food source for certain invertebrates."
