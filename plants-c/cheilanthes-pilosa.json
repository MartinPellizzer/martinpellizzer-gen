    "intro": "Cheilanthes pilosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy fronds that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing leaves that are typically light green to grayish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky outcrops. The hairy shield fern is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems."
