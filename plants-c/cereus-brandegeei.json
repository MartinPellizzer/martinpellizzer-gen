    "intro": "Cereus brandegeei, commonly known as the Brandegee's candleplant, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can grow up to several meters in height, which are covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces large, night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in dry conditions. Cereus brandegeei is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique blooming habit."
