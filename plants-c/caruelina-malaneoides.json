    "intro": "Caruelina malaneoides, commonly known as the Malaneoides lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers. The plant features lance-shaped, evergreen leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
