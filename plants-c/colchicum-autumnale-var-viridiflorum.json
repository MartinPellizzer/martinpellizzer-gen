    "intro": "Colchicum autumnale var. viridiflorum, commonly known as the green-flowered autumn crocus, is a perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features basal leaves that are broad and arrow-shaped, often with a waxy coating. It produces toxic bulbs that contain colchicine, a compound used in medicine. This variant differs from the typical C. autumnale by its distinctive greenish floral color and slightly different growth habits."
