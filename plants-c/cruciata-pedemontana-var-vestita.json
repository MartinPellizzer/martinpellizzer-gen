It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, adapted to withstand cold and high-altitude conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for pollinators and its ornamental value in horticulture."
