    "intro": "Crambe fruticosa var. brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf crambe, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, bushy foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by round, green pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract beneficial insects."
