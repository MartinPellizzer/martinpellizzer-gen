It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks, often in coastal areas. Its blue to violet flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually narrow and pinnately divided, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
