It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its simple, smooth leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially grown."
