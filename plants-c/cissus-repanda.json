    "intro": "Cissus repanda, commonly known as the rock fig or climbing cissus, is a vigorous, woody vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in small, white, waxy dots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental use."
