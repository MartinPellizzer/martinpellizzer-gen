    "intro": "Caprifolium microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are usually pink or white, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its berries, which are red when mature, are edible and often used in jams and wines. Caprifolium microphyllum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows."
