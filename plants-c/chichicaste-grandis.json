It belongs to the Cyatheaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizome system supports its growth and helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Chichicaste grandis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has cultural significance in some indigenous communities."
