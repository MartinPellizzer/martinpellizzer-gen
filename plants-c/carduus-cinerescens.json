    "intro": "Carduus cinerescens, commonly known as the cinerary thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its grayish-green, hairy foliage and spiny, lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by bristly, prickly seed heads. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in some regions but also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
