    "intro": "Cyclopeltis semicordata f. crenata, commonly known as the crested cyclopeltis, is a rare and distinctive fern native to southern China. It is characterized by its unique, undulating fronds that form a fan-like shape, with a prominent central rib and wavy margins. The plant's foliage is often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in horticulture."
