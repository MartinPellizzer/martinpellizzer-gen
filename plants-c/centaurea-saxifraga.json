    "intro": "Centaurea saxifraga, commonly known as the rock centaurea, is a flowering plant native to the rocky regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces vibrant blue to purple flowers. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and thistles, and is known for its ability to colonize harsh, rocky soils. Centaurea saxifraga is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
