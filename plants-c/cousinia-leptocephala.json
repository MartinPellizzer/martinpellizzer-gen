It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small, yellowish flowers are arranged in a compact cluster, and it produces slender, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Cousinia leptocephala is often found in mountainous areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
