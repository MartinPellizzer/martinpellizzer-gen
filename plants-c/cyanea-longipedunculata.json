    "intro": "Cyanea longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-peduncled Cyanea, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces elongated peduncles that support its clusters of tubular flowers. Cyanea longipedunculata is often found growing in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
