    "intro": "Cheirostylis chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese cheirostylis, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly China, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant orchid-like flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system, which helps it anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil. Cheirostylis chinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
