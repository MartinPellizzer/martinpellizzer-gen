    "intro": "Campanula linifolia f. ramulosa, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features silver-gray foliage covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help it retain moisture and withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
