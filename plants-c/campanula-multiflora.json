    "intro": "Campanula multiflora, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue, purple, or white. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Campanula multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
