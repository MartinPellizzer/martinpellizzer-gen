    "intro": "Carex alpina var. stevenii, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to mountainous regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady, wet areas."
