    "intro": "Corybas longipedunculatus, commonly known as the long-stemmed hooded orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive hood-like labellum and a slender peduncle that supports its single or few flowers. Native to New Zealand, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a prominent central ridge, and it produces small, dark brown seeds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
