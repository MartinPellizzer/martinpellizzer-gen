    "intro": "Cynanchum viminale subsp. suberosum, commonly known as the hairy milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems that become corky with age, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. The species is notable for its milky sap, which is a common feature among plants in the milkweed family."
