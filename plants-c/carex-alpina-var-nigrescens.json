    "intro": "Carex alpina var. nigrescens, commonly known as the black-stemmed sedge, is a perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in rocky or mountainous habitats. It is often found in meadows, tundra, and along streambanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
