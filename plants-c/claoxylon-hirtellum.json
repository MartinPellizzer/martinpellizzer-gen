    "intro": "Claoxylon hirtellum, commonly known as the woolly sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, flaky bark and heart-shaped leaves with a hairy underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Claoxylon hirtellum is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
