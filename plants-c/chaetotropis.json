    "intro": "Chaetotropis, commonly known as the silky spurge, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The flowers are small and clustered in complex inflorescences known as cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Chaetotropis species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. They are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative propagation."
