    "intro": "Campyloneurum crassifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often broad leaves that can grow up to several centimeters in length. The fronds are typically pinnately compound, with a distinctive, arching growth habit that allows the plant to thrive in shaded, humid environments. It prefers to grow on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
