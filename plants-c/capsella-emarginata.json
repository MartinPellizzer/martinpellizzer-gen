    "intro": "Capsella emarginata, commonly known as the mouse-ear chickweed, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other economically important plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters, with hairy stems and small, alternate leaves that are often heart-shaped. Its flowers are white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round pods that contain several seeds. Capsella emarginata is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
