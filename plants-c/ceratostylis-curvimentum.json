It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil. The orchid's unique flowering pattern and compact growth make it a distinctive species within the Orchidaceae family."
