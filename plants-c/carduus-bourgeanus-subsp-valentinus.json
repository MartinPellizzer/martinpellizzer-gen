    "intro": "Carduus bourgeanus subsp. valentinus, commonly known as the Valentine's thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Its common name reflects its association with Valentine's Day, though it is not traditionally used in floral arrangements. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some historical use in herbal medicine."
