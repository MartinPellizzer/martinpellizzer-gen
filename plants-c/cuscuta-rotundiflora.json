    "intro": "Cuscuta rotundiflora, commonly known as the roundleaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true roots, leaves, and stems. It attaches itself to host plants using specialized haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its life cycle is entirely dependent on host plants for survival and reproduction. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
