    "intro": "Cyperus dentatus var. ctenostachys, commonly known as the hairy flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist or wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in aquatic and wetland habitats."
