    "intro": "Crataegus scabera, commonly known as the rough Hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white to pinkish flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries in the fall, which are edible but often have a sour taste. Crataegus scabera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
