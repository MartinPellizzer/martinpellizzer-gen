    "intro": "Carronia, commonly known as the mountain heather, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Carronia is typically shrub-like in habit, with evergreen foliage that remains dense throughout the year. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscaping."
