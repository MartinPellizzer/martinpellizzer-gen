    "intro": "Cheilophyllum micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered cheilophyllum, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its root system is fibrous and can contribute to soil stabilization in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare species in certain regions of Europe."
