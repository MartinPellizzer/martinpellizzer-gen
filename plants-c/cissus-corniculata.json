    "intro": "Cissus corniculata, commonly known as the stonecrop ivy, is a climbing plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its trailing stems and small, waxy leaves that are often succulent in texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. It is well adapted to arid environments and can thrive in poor soil conditions. Cissus corniculata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to trail from hanging baskets or trellises."
