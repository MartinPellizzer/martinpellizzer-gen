    "intro": "Chamaecrista ensiformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf burr legume, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and pairs of small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and disturbed areas. Due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal, it can become invasive in certain regions."
