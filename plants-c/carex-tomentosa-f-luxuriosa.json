    "intro": "Carex tomentosa f. luxuriosa, commonly known as the woolly sedge, is a variant of the common sedge species. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and soft, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. This ornamental sedge is valued for its ability to add texture and interest to water gardens and bog landscapes."
