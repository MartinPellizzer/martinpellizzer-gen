    "intro": "Coilantha sessei, commonly known as the Kauai coilantha, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky areas. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Coilantha sessei is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaii's Endangered Species Act."
