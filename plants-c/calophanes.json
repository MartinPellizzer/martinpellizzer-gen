    "intro": "Calophanes, commonly known as the \"beardtongue,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae. These plants are characterized by their attractive, tubular or bell-shaped flowers that often come in shades of purple, pink, or white. Calophanes species are native to various regions across the Americas, particularly in the United States and Mexico. They typically grow in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The leaves are usually opposite and lance-shaped, with a rough or hairy texture that aids in water conservation."
