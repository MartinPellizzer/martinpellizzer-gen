    "intro": "Conium nodosum, commonly known as hemlock, is a poisonous flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in umbrella-shaped clusters. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, particularly coniine, which can be lethal to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its toxicity, it is important to identify and avoid this plant in natural settings."
