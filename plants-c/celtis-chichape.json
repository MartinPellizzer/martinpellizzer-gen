    "intro": "Celtis chichape, commonly known as the Mexican hackberry, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Elaeocarpaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, round berries that are edible for some wildlife but not typically consumed by humans. Celtis chichape is often found in dry to moist forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local fauna."
