    "intro": "Calophyllum dasypodium, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a tropical tree native to Africa, particularly found in countries like Ghana and Nigeria. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and large, palmate leaves. The tree produces yellow flowers that are followed by woody, elliptical fruits containing a fatty seed kernel. The kernel is the primary source of shea butter, which is widely used in cosmetics and traditional medicine. Its ecological and economic importance makes it a significant species in both local and international markets."
