    "intro": "Carpinus putoensis, commonly known as the Puto's hornbeam, is a rare and lesser-known species of the Betulaceae family. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Its fruits are small, woody drupes that contain a single seed, and they mature in the fall. This species is native to a limited geographic region and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments."
