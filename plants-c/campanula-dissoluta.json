    "intro": "Campanula dissoluta, commonly known as the bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. Campanula dissoluta is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
