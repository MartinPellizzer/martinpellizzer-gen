    "intro": "Chlorophytum acaule, commonly known as the snake plant or mother-in-law's tongue, is a hardy, evergreen perennial plant native to South Africa. It features upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a white or yellowish stripe down the center. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires minimal water, making it an ideal choice for indoor gardening. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers on long, slender stalks, though it is more prized for its foliage than its blooms. Chlorophytum acaule is also noted for its air-purifying qualities, contributing to improved indoor air quality."
