    "intro": "Combretum meridionalis, commonly known as the southern flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its striking red or orange floral bracts that appear in late summer. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. The bark is typically smooth and may exude a sticky resin when damaged."
