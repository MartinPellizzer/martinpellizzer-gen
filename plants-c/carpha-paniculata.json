It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant features triangular, narrow leaves and produces inflorescences of small, clustered flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. Carpha paniculata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
