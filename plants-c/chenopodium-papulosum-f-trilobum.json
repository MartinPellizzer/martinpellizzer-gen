    "intro": "Chenopodium papulosum f. trilobum, commonly known as the three-lobed goosefoot, is a variant of the annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, three-lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, powdery hairs. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and are pollinated by wind. The plant is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
