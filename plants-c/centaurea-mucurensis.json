    "intro": "Centaurea mucurensis, commonly known as the Alborz centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Alborz Mountains in Iran. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces vibrant blue to violet flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, which are typical of the genus Centaurea. It thrives in rocky and mountainous environments, often found in open, sunny areas with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
