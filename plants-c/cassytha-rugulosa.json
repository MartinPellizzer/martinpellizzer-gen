    "intro": "Cassytha rugulosa, commonly known as the silky cassytha, is a parasitic vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often grow along the ground or through the foliage of other plants. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria that attach to host plants. Its small, opposite leaves are usually covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, greenish-white flowers and is often found in wet, shaded environments."
