    "intro": "Caltha palustris var. membranacea, commonly known as the membranous marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear large, showy yellow flowers with prominent yellow stamens. The leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a waxy, membranous texture, which is characteristic of the varietal form. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. This plant plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
