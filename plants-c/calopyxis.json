    "intro": "Calopyxis, commonly known as the sea hare, is a genus of sea slugs belonging to the family Anisophrimidae. These marine gastropod mollusks are characterized by their soft, often colorful bodies and lack of a shell. They are typically found in coastal waters and are known for their ability to change color for camouflage. Calopyxis species feed on algae and other microscopic organisms, playing a role in marine ecosystems. Their unique appearance and behavior make them interesting subjects for both scientific study and underwater observation."
