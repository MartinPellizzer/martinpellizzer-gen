    "intro": "Cuscuta boliviana var. paranensis, commonly known as the parasitic dodder, is a flowering plant in the family Convolvulaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it attaches to host plants and derives some of its nutrients from them while also performing photosynthesis. The plant is characterized by its yellow-orange, thread-like stems that coil around its host. It lacks true leaves and roots, relying instead on specialized structures called haustoria to extract water and nutrients. This species is often found in arid regions and can parasitize a variety of host plants, including shrubs and trees."
