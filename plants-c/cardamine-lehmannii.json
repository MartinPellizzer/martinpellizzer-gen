    "intro": "Cardamine lehmannii, commonly known as Lehmann's buttercup, is a small herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with showy, often yellow or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky slopes. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three parts, and the flowers are usually solitary with five petals. Cardamine lehmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
