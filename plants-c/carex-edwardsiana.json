    "intro": "Carex edwardsiana, commonly known as Edwards' sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, stream banks, and forested areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. Edwards' sedge plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
