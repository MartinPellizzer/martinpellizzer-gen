    "intro": "Celsia floccosa var. affinis, commonly known as the woolly celsia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly coating on its stems and leaves, which provides insulation and protection against harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, adding ornamental value. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
