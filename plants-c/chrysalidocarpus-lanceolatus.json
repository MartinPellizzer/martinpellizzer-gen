    "intro": "Chrysalidocarpus lanceolatus, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a tall, evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach lengths of up to 5 meters. The plant produces large, fibrous fruits called coconuts, which contain both water and a white, fleshy interior. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize coastal areas, making it important for erosion control. The coconut palm is also valued for its economic and cultural significance in many tropical countries."
