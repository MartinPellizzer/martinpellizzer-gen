    "intro": "Caralluma lugardii, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and potatoes, and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically yellow or orange when mature. Caralluma lugardii is also known for its traditional use in herbal medicine, particularly for its purported appetite-suppressing properties."
