    "intro": "Clidemia tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, four-angled leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its small, yellowish flowers are followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Clidemia tetragona is often found in disturbed habitats and can be invasive in certain regions."
