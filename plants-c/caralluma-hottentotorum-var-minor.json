It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
