    "intro": "Cirsium penicillatum var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, lobed leaves covered in a dense layer of white, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces purple to violet flower heads composed of numerous small florets, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves and stems are typically covered in a thick, woolly coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. This species is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
