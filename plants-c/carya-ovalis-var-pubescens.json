    "intro": "Carya ovalis var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent hickory, is a variant of the hickory tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its oval-shaped nuts enclosed in a thick, spiny husk. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by edible nuts that are highly valued for their flavor and nutritional content. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas."
