    "intro": "Cheilanthes culcita, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial plant that thrives in rocky, arid environments, often growing on limestone or sandstone. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form with closely spaced, lance-shaped leaves. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Cheilanthes culcita is well adapted to drought and is often found in crevices or on rock faces where it can access limited soil and water."
