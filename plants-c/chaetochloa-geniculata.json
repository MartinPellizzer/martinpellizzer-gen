    "intro": "Chaetochloa geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzag or helical arrangement of its leaf blades, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, often saline or brackish environments, such as coastal areas and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous structure that contributes to its resilience in harsh conditions. Chaetochloa geniculata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
