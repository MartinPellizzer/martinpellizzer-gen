    "intro": "Clematis anethifolia var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clematis, is a perennial vine native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, climbing stems that can reach lengths of up to 10 meters, supported by twining tendrils. The leaves are compound, with finely divided, anise-like foliage that gives the plant its common name. It produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne in clusters at the base of the stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
