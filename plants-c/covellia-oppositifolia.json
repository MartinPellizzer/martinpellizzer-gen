    "intro": "Covellia oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaved everlet, is a unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite leaf arrangement, where leaves grow directly across from each other on the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often a deep green with a slightly waxy texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Covellia oppositifolia is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional herbal medicine."
