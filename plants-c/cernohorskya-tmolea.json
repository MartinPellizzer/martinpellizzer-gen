It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus with pale green to bluish-gray stems that are covered in small, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Cernohorskya tmolea is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in providing habitat for various desert wildlife."
