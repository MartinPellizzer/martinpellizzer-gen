    "intro": "Calyptroon sumatranum, commonly known as the Sumatran calyptroon, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the tropical regions of Indonesia. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants such as philodendrons and peace lilies, and is characterized by its unique inflorescence structure. The plant features a striking, spadix-like flower cluster surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, which is often brightly colored. Its leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and have a waxy texture, adapted to thrive in humid, shady environments. Calyptroon sumatranum is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
