    "intro": "Crataegus flava var. pubescens, commonly known as the yellow hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and orange-red fruits, which are typical of the Crataegus genus. The leaves are usually oval-shaped with serrated edges and a hairy texture, especially on the underside, giving it the \"pubescens\" variety name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in woodland edges or open areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
