It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and is often found in moist, lowland forests. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers. It is valued for its timber but is also recognized for its ecological importance in its native habitat. Due to overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species in some regions."
