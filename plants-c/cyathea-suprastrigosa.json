    "intro": "Cyathea suprastrigosa, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, hairy layer. The plant produces large, compound fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Cyathea suprastrigosa is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions."
