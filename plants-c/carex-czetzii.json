    "intro": "Carex czetzii, commonly known as the Czetzii sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to parts of Europe and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers in the summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Carex czetzii is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
