It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, depending on the soil pH. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.
