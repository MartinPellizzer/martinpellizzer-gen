    "intro": "Calycobolus pulchellus, commonly known as the beautiful calycobolus, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its distinctive floral structure. The plant produces small, delicate flowers with a unique calyx that remains attached to the fruit, a feature that gives it its scientific name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
