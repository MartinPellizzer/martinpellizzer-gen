    "intro": "Calathea bicolor, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with contrasting green and silver patterns. The leaves are typically oval or lance-shaped and have a waxy texture. Calathea bicolor thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its vibrant appearance. Its unique leaf movement, where the leaves fold shut at night, adds to its ornamental appeal."
