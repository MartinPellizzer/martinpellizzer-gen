    "intro": "Castilleja linariifolia var. omnipubescens, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
