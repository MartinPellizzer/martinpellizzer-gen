    "intro": "Cassipourea paradoxa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and beauty. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
