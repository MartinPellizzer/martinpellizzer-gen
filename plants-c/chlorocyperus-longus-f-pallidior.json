The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in width. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist environments."
