    "intro": "Cyrtandra compressa, commonly known as the flat-stemmed heliconia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, including Hawaii, Tahiti, and the Marquesas Islands. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its clustered, often colorful bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial with smooth, compressed stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spiral arrangement of small, white to pale yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Cyrtandra compressa is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and coastal areas."
