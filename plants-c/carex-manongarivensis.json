    "intro": "Carex manongarivensis, commonly known as the Manongarivensis sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of New Zealand. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense clumps that help stabilize aquatic environments. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are usually wind-pollinated, and it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
