    "intro": "Croton laceratoglandulosus, commonly known as the glandular-leaf croton, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves with serrated edges and glandular hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
