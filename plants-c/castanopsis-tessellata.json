    "intro": "Castanopsis tessellata, commonly known as the tessellated tallowwood, is a species of evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically green or reddish in color, followed by spiny, cupule-like fruits containing one or two seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a textured, scaly surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Castanopsis tessellata is typically found in rainforest or sclerophyllous vegetation, growing in well-drained soils."
