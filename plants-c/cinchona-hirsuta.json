    "intro": "Cinchona hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy quinine tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly the Andes. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It produces small, fragrant flowers and red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. While not as well-known for its medicinal properties as other cinchona species, it still holds ecological and botanical significance in its native habitats."
