    "intro": "Coilocarpus, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Indian mulberry, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their palmate leaves, which are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. They typically grow in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shady environments. Coilocarpus species produce small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. The fruits are small, round, and edible, though they are not widely consumed by humans."
