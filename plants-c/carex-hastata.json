    "intro": "Carex hastata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like structures, and it produces three-sided, triangular seeds. Carex hastata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
