    "intro": "Celsia interrupta var. sudanica, commonly known as the Sudanese celsia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Sudan. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale blue. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in dry gardens and rockeries."
