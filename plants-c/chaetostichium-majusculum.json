    "intro": "Chaetostichium majusculum, commonly known as the giant hair fern, is a striking fern species characterized by its large, feathery fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features long, segmented stems with hairy, dark green leaves that give it its common name. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, typical of fern reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
