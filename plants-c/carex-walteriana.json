    "intro": "Carex walteriana, commonly known as Walter's sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spikelets, and it produces three-sided, boat-shaped seeds. Walter's sedge is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
