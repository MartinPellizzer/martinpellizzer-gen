    "intro": "Cyrtorchis praetermissa subsp. zuluensis, commonly known as the Zulu orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in woodland areas, thriving in semi-shade conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
