    "intro": "Calanthe discolor var. tokunoshimensis, commonly known as the Tokunoshima calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to Japan. It features elegant, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant produces showy, pale pink to white flowers with a distinctive yellow lip, which bloom in late spring. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
