    "intro": "Coelogyne fusca, commonly known as the black orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, flower spikes and its unique, fragrant blooms. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to white, contrasting with the dark foliage. Coelogyne fusca is prized in horticulture for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
