    "intro": "Caltha palustris subsp. asarifolia, commonly known as the slender marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively. It is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other damp environments where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
