    "intro": "Cotoneaster multiflorus subsp. granatensis, commonly known as the granate cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, bright red berries that are visually striking. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and it blooms with clusters of white to pink flowers in the spring. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its aggressive growth and seed dispersal capabilities."
