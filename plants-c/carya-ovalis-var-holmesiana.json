    "intro": "Carya ovalis var. holmesiana, commonly known as the Holmes' hickory, is a variant of the winged hickory native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by edible, sweet, edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomland hardwood forests. The species is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
