    "intro": "Corydalis brevicalcarata, commonly known as the short-spurred corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, tubular flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers partial shade and well-drained soil."
