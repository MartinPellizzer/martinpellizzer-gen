    "intro": "Cynosurus cristatus var. ciliatus, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive tufted inflorescence, which gives it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a component in native plant gardens."
