    "intro": "Callitris intermedia, commonly known as the coastal or narrow-leaf callitris, is a species of coniferous tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, and it is adapted to thrive in coastal and sandy environments. Callitris intermedia is often found in dunes and heathlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its hardy nature makes it a resilient plant in arid and saline conditions."
