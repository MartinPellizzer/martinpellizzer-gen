    "intro": "Cheiloplecton rigidum, commonly known as the rigid false hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is tuberous, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Cheiloplecton rigidum is typically found in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to sunny, well-drained environments."
