It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, pointed leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. This variant is notable for its compact growth habit and is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and ecological value."
