    "intro": "Centropogon llanganatensis, commonly known as the Llanganatensis grass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to cold, dry environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
