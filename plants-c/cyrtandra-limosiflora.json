    "intro": "Cyrtandra limosiflora, commonly known as the wetland cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
