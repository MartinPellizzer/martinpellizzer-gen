    "intro": "Cocculus sarmentosus, commonly known as the climbing quince, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. The plant is characterized by its trailing habit and hairy stems, which help it climb and spread along forest floors. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while the fruit turns orange when mature. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
