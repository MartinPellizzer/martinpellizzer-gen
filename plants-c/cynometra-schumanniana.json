    "intro": "Cynometra schumanniana, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing flat, bean-like seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
