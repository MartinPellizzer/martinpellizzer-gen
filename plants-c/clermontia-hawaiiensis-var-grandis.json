    "intro": "Clermontia hawaiiensis var. grandis, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 false flax, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, this endemic species is considered threatened and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
