    "intro": "Callipteris ferox, commonly known as the stiff panic grass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a perennial grass that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal plain habitats. The plant has tall, rigid stalks that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. Callipteris ferox is known for its resilience to salt spray and wind, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
