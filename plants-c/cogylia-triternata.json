    "intro": "Cogylia triternata, commonly known as the three-parted cogon grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a triangular pattern. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural areas."
