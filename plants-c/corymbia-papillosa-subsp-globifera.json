    "intro": "Corymbia papillosa subsp. globifera, commonly known as the globifera bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin layers, and its lance-shaped, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The tree produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, round, red or pink fruits. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and resilience to bushfires."
