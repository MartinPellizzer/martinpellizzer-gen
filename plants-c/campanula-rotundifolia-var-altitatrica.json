It is characterized by its rounded, broad leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, sky-blue to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine zones, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these ecosystems. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
