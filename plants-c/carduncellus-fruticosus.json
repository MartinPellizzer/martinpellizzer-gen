    "intro": "Carduncellus fruticosus, commonly known as the thorny burr or goat's beard, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, bract-like leaves that form a dense, woody structure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by distinctive, spiky fruits that persist into winter. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and scrublands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
