    "intro": "Campanula pseudocarpatica, commonly known as the false bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its botanical name reflects its resemblance to other campanula species, though it is botanically distinct."
