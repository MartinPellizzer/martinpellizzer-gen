    "intro": "Cinnamomum zeylanicum var. humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt cinnamon, is a rare variant of the cinnamon tree native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain aromatic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and perfumery. Its botanical features include lance-shaped leaves with a fragrant scent and a preference for warm, humid climates. Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
