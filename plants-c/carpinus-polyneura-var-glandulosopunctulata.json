    "intro": "Carpinus polyneura var. glandulosopunctulata, commonly known as the hairy-pointed hornbeam, is a variant of the hornbeam tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely toothed leaves that are often covered in small, glandular dots. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and adaptability to various soil types."
