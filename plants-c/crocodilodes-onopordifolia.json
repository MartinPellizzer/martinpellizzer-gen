    "intro": "Crocodilodes onopordifolia, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
