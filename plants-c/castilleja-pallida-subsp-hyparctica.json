    "intro": "Castilleja pallida subsp. hyparctica, commonly known as the pale castilleja, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on the roots of other plants for some of its nutrients. It is native to the western United States and parts of Canada, typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant has showy, red-orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Castilleja pallida subsp. hyparctica plays a role in its ecosystem by supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
