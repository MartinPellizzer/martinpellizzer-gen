    "intro": "Celastrus hypoleucus f. genuinus, commonly known as the white-flowered bittersweet, is a rare and distinctive variant of the bittersweet plant. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers, which contrast with the typical orange-red blooms of the species. This plant is native to specific regions in North America, particularly in the eastern United States. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its ecological role in forest understories."
