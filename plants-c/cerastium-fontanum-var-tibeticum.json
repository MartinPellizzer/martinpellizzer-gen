    "intro": "Cerastium fontanum var. tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Its compact growth habit and frost tolerance make it well adapted to high-altitude conditions. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in colder climates due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
