It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, broad leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces a fruit similar to the cupua\u00e7u, which is valued for its high nutritional content and aromatic properties. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
