    "intro": "Cyclosorus orientalis, commonly known as the oriental cyclosorus, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its submerged, branching stems and small, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by the development of small, globose fruits. It is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, and is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
