    "intro": "Ceanothus cuneatus var. rigidus, commonly known as the rigid ceanothus, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in coastal and foothill regions. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native landscaping."
