    "intro": "Clausia kasakhorum, commonly known as the Karakorum clausia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
