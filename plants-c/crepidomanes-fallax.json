It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disk. Crepidomanes fallax is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local pollinator populations."
