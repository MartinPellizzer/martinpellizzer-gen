    "intro": "Calamagrostis angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf grass or silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often silvery-blue in color. The plant produces feathery, plume-like inflorescences that add ornamental value, especially in late summer and autumn. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Botanically, it is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
