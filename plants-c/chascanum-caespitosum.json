    "intro": "Chascanum caespitosum, commonly known as the Andean spinach or quinoa relative, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its leaves are edible and have a mild, slightly nutty flavor, making it a valuable crop in traditional Andean agriculture. However, it is not as widely cultivated as other members of its family, such as quinoa."
