    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum leopardinum, commonly known as the leopard orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its intricate, leopard-like patterns on its petals, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in cloud forests or mountainous regions. Its flowers are usually small but highly ornate, with a complex arrangement of colors and textures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
