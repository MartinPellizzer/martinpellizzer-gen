    "intro": "Cerastium gracile subsp. bulgaricum, commonly known as the Bulgarian mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Balkan region. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky slopes. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust growth compared to other members of the Cerastium genus."
