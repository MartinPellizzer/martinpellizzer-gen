    "intro": "Cyperus longistolon, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along water edges, and can thrive in both freshwater and brackish environments. Its slender, grass-like stems are often found in dense clusters, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Cyperus longistolon is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
