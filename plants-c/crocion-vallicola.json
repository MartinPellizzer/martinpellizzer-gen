    "intro": "Crocion vallicola, commonly known as the mountain holly. It is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Crocion vallicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
