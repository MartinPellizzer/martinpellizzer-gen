It is characterized by its heart-shaped, brightly colored leaves that often display shades of red, pink, and white. The plant has a short, thick stem and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow. Its leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it the \"hairy\" appearance in its name. Caladium pubescens thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade."
