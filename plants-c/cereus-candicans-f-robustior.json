    "intro": "Cereus candicans f. robustior, commonly known as the robust candle cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that are covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming at night. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for collectors and desert gardeners."
