It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by follicle fruits containing toxic seeds. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is used in traditional medicine, though its toxic properties require caution."
