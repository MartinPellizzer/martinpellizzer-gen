It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds."
