    "intro": "Campomanesia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy campomanesia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. These berries are rich in vitamin C and are often consumed by both humans and wildlife. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and fruit."
