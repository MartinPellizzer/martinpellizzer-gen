It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom in the summer months. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking appearance and adaptability to various soil conditions."
