    "intro": "Carpacoce gigantea, commonly known as the giant carpacoce, is a rare and enigmatic plant species belonging to the family Carpacocaceae. It is characterized by its large, fleshy, and often brightly colored leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation and evolution. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Carpacoce gigantea is considered endangered in its native range."
