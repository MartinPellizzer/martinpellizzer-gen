    "intro": "Caladenia melanema, commonly known as the black-leafed spider orchid, is a striking terrestrial orchid native to southern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, spider-like flowers that are typically dark red or purple in color. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears a few flowers, each with a distinctive, elongated labellum. Caladenia melanema thrives in sandy soils and is often found in open forests or heathlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species."
