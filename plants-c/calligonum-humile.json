    "intro": "Calligonum humile, commonly known as the desert honeysuckle, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has woody stems and narrow, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall. Its resilience makes it an important plant in ecological restoration projects in desert ecosystems."
