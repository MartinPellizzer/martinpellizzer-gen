It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer. Carex wilfordii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
