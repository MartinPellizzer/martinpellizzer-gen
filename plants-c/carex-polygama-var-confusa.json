    "intro": "Carex polygama var. confusa, commonly known as the hairy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually hairy, giving it a distinctive texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife."
