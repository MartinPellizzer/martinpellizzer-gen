    "intro": "Carex latebrosa, commonly known as the broad-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its robust, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Carex latebrosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
