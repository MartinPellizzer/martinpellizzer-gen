    "intro": "Calamagrostis vicunarum var. tenuior, commonly known as slender marsh reed, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in Europe. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, arching stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its narrow leaves are grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences in late summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity."
