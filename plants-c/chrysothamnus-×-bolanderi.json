    "intro": "Chrysothamnus \u00d7 bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's goldenbush, is a hybrid plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in the summer, which are clustered in heads and attract various pollinators. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Chrysothamnus \u00d7 bolanderi is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
