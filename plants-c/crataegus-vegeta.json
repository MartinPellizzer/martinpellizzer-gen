    "intro": "Crataegus vegeta, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which are edible but typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. Crataegus vegeta is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It plays an important role in supporting biodiversity and is also valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
