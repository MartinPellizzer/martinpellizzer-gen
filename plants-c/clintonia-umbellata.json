    "intro": "Clintonia umbellata, commonly known as the white fringed gentian, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and has lance-shaped leaves with distinctive white veins. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dark berries that are dispersed by birds. Clintonia umbellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
