    "intro": "Cotoneaster cinerascens, commonly known as the ash cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters, featuring dense, upright growth with many branches. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a grayish-green upper surface and a lighter underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. Cotoneaster cinerascens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
