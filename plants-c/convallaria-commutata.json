    "intro": "Convallaria commutata, commonly known as the lesser lily of the valley, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Convallariaceae. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded woodland environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinct botanical appearance."
