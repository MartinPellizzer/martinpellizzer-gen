    "intro": "Curcuma longa, commonly known as turmeric, is a rhizomatous herbaceous plant native to South Asia. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, yellow-orange rhizomes. The rhizomes contain curcuminoids, which are responsible for its distinctive color and many of its medicinal properties. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, sword-shaped leaves and small, pale yellow flowers. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and high humidity."
