    "intro": "Chamaepeuce alpini, commonly known as alpine chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions. It typically features small, spoon-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tiny white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine zones. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in rocky or sandy soils. Chamaepeuce alpini is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in herbal medicine."
