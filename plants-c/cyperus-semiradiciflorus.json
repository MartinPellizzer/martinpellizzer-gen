    "intro": "Cyperus semiradiciflorus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has cylindrical, grass-like leaves that are often green or bluish-green in color. Its flowering stems bear small, clustered spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Cyperus semiradiciflorus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
