    "intro": "Cyclosorus laevis, commonly known as the smooth cyclosorus, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically four-lobed and have a smooth surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its reproductive structures include tiny, spore-producing organs called sporocarps, which are embedded in the leaf surfaces. Cyclosorus laevis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
