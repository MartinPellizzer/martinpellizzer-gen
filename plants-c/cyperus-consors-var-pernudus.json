    "intro": "Cyperus consors var. pernudus, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on elongated inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in wetland and aquatic environments. It is often found in marshy areas, along the edges of ponds, and in disturbed soils near water bodies."
