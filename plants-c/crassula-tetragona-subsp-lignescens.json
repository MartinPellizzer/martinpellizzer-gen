    "intro": "Crassula tetragona subsp. lignescens, commonly known as the Forest Crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and fleshy, dark green leaves that often develop a reddish tinge when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
