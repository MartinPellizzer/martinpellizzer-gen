    "intro": "Cerophyllum, commonly known as water shield, is a aquatic plant characterized by its distinctive rosette of floating leaves. The leaves are broad, waxy, and often have a shield-like shape, which helps them float on the water's surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, emerging from the water. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Cerophyllum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
