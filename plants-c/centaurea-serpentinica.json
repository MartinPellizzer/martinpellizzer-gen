    "intro": "Centaurea serpentinica, commonly known as the serpentine centaury, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. It is often found in soils rich in magnesium and poor in nutrients, such as serpentine soils. Centaurea serpentinica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging ecological niches."
