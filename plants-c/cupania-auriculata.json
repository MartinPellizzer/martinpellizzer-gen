    "intro": "Cupania auriculata, commonly known as the ear-shaped cupania, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often heart-shaped or auriculate at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a feature common in the Euphorbiaceae family. Cupania auriculata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
