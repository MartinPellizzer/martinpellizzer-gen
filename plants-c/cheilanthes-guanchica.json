    "intro": "Cheilanthes guanchica, commonly known as the Canary Island rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to the Canary Islands and is typically found growing on rocky substrates in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a compact, rhizomatous growth habit with small, leathery, evergreen leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Cheilanthes guanchica is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
