It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine, often found in woodland or shady areas. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely pointed leaf tips and slightly different floral structure compared to other Clematis species."
