    "intro": "Camellia transarisanensis, commonly known as the Transarisan camellia, is a rare and ornamental evergreen shrub native to the Transarisan Mountains in Indonesia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves and striking, showy flowers that range in color from red to pink. The plant produces elliptical, woody fruits that contain two to four seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
