It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with a slender stem that is often tinged with green or purple. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately divided, and emit a mild, parsley-like odor when crushed. The flowers are small and white, forming umbrella-shaped clusters at the top of the plant."
