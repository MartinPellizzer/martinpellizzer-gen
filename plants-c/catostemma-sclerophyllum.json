    "intro": "Catostemma sclerophyllum, commonly known as the hard-leaved catostemma, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in small, capsule-like fruits that split open to release the seeds. Catostemma sclerophyllum is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can withstand prolonged periods of drought."
