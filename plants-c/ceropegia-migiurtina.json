    "intro": "Ceropegia migiurtina, commonly known as the \"Bead Leaf\" or \"String of Hearts,\" is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a trailing or climbing succulent with fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale green, which are pollinated by specific insects. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Ceropegia migiurtina is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and ease of care."
