It features striking purple to violet flowers with a distinctive, recurved petal shape. The plant produces a single, showy bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its bulbs are adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrive in full sun. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit."
