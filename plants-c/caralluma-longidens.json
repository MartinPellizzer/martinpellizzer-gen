    "intro": "Caralluma longidens, commonly known as the long-spined devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red berries containing seeds. Its leaves are reduced to small spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration. Caralluma longidens is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
