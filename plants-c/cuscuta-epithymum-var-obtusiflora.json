    "intro": "Cuscuta epithymum var. obtusiflora, commonly known as the blunt-flowered dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish or reddish flowers and has a unique structure of slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to infest a variety of host species, including shrubs and herbs. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for many years, contributing to its persistence in ecosystems. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural and ornamental plants."
