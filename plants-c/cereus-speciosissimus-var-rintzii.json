    "intro": "Cereus speciosissimus var. rintzii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cacti species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and spiny ribs, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent nature allows it to store moisture efficiently, making it well-suited for dry climates. The flowers typically last only one night, adding to the plant's allure and rarity."
