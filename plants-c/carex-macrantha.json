    "intro": "Carex macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces tall, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, white to pale pink flowers. Carex macrantha typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
