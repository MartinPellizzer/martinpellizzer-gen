    "intro": "Cissus heptaphylla, commonly known as the seven-leaf cissus, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which are typically seven-lobed, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its stems are succulent and can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along surfaces. Cissus heptaphylla thrives in warm, humid environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage."
