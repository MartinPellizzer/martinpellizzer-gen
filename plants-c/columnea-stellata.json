    "intro": "Columnea stellata, commonly known as the star columnea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The flowers are typically red or orange with a white or yellow throat, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
