    "intro": "Cereus incrustatus, commonly known as the rock cactus or incrustation cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are often covered in a layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a feature typical of many desert cacti. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming make it a popular choice for desert gardens."
