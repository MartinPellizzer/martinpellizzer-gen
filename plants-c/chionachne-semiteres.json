    "intro": "Chionachne semiteres, commonly known as the woolly grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, soft hairs on its leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Chionachne semiteres plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
