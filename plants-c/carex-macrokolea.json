    "intro": "Carex macrokolea, commonly known as the large-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex macrokolea is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
