    "intro": "Carthamodes eriocephala, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fuzzy, silver-green leaves and bright yellow ray flowers that resemble those of a sunflower. The plant produces small, spiky seed heads that are covered in white, fluffy pappi, which aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
