    "intro": "Canidia magica, commonly known as the Moonflower of Eldoria, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty forests of the southern continent. It features delicate, white petals that open only under the light of the full moon, releasing a faint, intoxicating fragrance. The plant's leaves are broad and velvety, with a silvery sheen that reflects moonlight. Its root system is said to absorb lunar energy, contributing to its mystical properties. Botanists classify it as a unique member of the Noctiflorae family, known for its nocturnal blooming habits."
