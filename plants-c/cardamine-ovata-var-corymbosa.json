    "intro": "Cardamine ovata var. corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered water crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It features finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating on the surface of water. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in corymbs, typically blooming in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wetlands. This species is valued for its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in water gardens."
