It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces dark purple to black spikelets that are arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. It thrives in rich, organic soils and is often found in woodlands, streambanks, and wet meadows. Due to its striking appearance and ecological value, it is a popular choice for wetland restoration and ornamental gardening."
