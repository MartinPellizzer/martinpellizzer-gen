    "intro": "Commiphora mulelame, commonly known as Indian myrrh, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, aromatic resinous capsules. The resin, known as mukul myrrh, is harvested from the tree's bark and has been used traditionally for its medicinal and aromatic properties. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and forest edge habitats."
