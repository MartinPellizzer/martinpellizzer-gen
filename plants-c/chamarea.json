These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their bell-shaped, often brightly colored flowers. Chamarea species typically grow in grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. They are herbaceous perennials, often forming clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves. The flowers bloom in spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
