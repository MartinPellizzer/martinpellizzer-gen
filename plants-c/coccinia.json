    "intro": "Coccinia, commonly known as the \"bitter melon,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the Cucurbitaceae family. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Coccinia species are characterized by their trailing or climbing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The fruits are typically elongated, green, and covered with small warts, and they become orange-red when ripe. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their edible fruits, though many are used in traditional medicine."
