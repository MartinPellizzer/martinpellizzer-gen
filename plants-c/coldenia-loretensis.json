    "intro": "[WRONG START] Coldernia loretensis, commonly known as the Loretto coldenia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as montane forests, and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers are usually pink or white with prominent stamens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
