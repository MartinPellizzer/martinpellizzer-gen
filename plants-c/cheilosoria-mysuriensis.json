    "intro": "Cheilosoria mysuriensis, commonly known as the Indian rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, while its flowers are small, usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
