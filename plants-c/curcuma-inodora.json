    "intro": "Curcuma inodora, commonly known as the white turmeric, is a rhizomatous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, pale yellow to white rhizomes. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, pale yellow flowers. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, though they are less commonly used than those of Curcuma longa. Botanically, it is distinguished by its lack of a strong odor, hence its common name."
