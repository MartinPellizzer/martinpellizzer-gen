    "intro": "Copiapoa sarcoana, commonly known as the Puna cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is a columnar cactus with a greenish-gray stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically solitary and located at the top of the stem. It has a shallow root system adapted to the arid environment, allowing it to absorb moisture from brief rainfall. Copiapoa sarcoana is known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stem, making it well-suited for survival in extreme desert conditions."
