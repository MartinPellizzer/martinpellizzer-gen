    "intro": "Clerodendrum affine, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a flowering shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, papery bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are often brightly colored in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered within the bracts, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture."
