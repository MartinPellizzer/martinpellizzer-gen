    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nauseosus subsp. psilocarpus, commonly known as the yellow rabbitbrush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow-green foliage and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different flower structure and leaf morphology compared to other members of the species."
