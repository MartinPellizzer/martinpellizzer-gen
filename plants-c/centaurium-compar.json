    "intro": "Centaurium compar, commonly known as the lesser centaury, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, linear to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink to red, which bloom in early summer. Its flowers are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Centaurium compar is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses."
