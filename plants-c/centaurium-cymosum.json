It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple, with five petals and a distinctive central spur. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and woodland edges."
