    "intro": "Collania petraea, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga. It thrives in rocky, arid environments, often found on exposed limestone or granite surfaces. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the fungal and algal components. It plays a crucial role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in harsh environments. Due to its specialized habitat, it is often used as an indicator species for environmental health."
