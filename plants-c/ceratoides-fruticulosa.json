    "intro": "Ceratoides fruticulosa, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Ceratoides fruticulosa plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
