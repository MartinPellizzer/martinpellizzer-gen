    "intro": "Campanula scoparia, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. The plant produces bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense mat. Campanula scoparia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in rocky environments."
