    "intro": "Clidemia trichopoda, commonly known as velvetleaf or false chinchweed, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Clidemia trichopoda is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
