    "intro": "Crocodilodes grandifolia, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. Its leaves are typically a deep green with a waxy surface that helps repel water, while its flowers are showy, with white petals that bloom at night. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, and is native to tropical regions of South America. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration. Due to its size and beauty, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and large water features."
