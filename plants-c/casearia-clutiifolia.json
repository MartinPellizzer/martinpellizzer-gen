    "intro": "Casearia clutiifolia, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by spherical, red berries that contain a single seed. It thrives in coastal areas, often growing in brackish water or salt marshes, and is adapted to tolerate saline conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing shorelines."
