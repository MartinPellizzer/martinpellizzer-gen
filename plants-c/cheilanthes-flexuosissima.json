    "intro": "Cheilanthes flexuosissima, commonly known as the flexible rockcap, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizome and its ability to thrive in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its lanceolate, leathery fronds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. This fern is often found growing on limestone or shale, making it a common sight in desert and semi-desert regions."
