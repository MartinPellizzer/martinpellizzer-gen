It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads that resemble thistles. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it has been introduced to other regions, including North America. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and potentially invasive in certain environments."
