    "intro": "Chrysobalanus icaco subsp. atacorensis, commonly known as the Atacorian wax apple, is a tropical tree native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fleshy, orange-red fruits with a sweet, acidic pulp. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and different leaf and fruit morphology compared to the main species."
