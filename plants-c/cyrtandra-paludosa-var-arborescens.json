    "intro": "Cyrtandra paludosa var. arborescens, commonly known as the swamp cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It is a herbaceous or shrub-like species with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with showy white or pale pink petals, typically arranged in inflorescences at the ends of stems. It thrives in wetland or marshy habitats, preferring moist, well-drained soils. This variant is distinguished by its more upright growth habit compared to other Cyrtandra species."
