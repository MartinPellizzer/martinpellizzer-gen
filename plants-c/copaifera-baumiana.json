    "intro": "Copaifera baumiana, commonly known as the Brazilian copaiba, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, aromatic capsules containing numerous seeds. Its resin, known as copaiba balm, is widely used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. The tree plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
