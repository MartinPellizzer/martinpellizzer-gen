    "intro": "Chamaemelum tanacetifolium, commonly known as yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its feathery, aromatic leaves and flat, composite flower heads that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Yarrow produces small, yellow disk flowers surrounded by ray florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is also known for its medicinal properties, with a long history of use in traditional herbal remedies."
