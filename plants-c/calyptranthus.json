    "intro": "Calyptranthus, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plants are typically low-growing shrubs with dense, evergreen foliage that is adapted to survive in hot, dry conditions. Calyptranthus species have small, opposite leaves and produce showy inflorescences that bloom in spring or early summer. These plants are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
