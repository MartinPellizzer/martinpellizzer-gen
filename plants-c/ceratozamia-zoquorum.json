    "intro": "Ceratozamia zoquorum, commonly known as the Zoque cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a thick, fibrous root system and a distinctive, spiky appearance. It produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common among cycads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ceratozamia zoquorum is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical research."
