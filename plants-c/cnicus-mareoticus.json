    "intro": "Cnicus mareoticus, commonly known as the Egyptian carnation, is a flowering plant native to the Nile Delta region of Egypt. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces vibrant pink or red flowers. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found near water bodies. Due to its ornamental value and historical significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
