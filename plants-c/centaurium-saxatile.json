    "intro": "Centaurium saxatile, commonly known as mountain centaury, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, often hairy stems that typically reach heights of 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, adapting to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Centaurium saxatile is often found in rocky soils and is a characteristic component of alpine meadows and scree slopes."
