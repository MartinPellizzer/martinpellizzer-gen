    "intro": "Crataegus trachyphylla, commonly known as the rough-leaved hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thick, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red or orange berries that are edible for birds and mammals but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed areas. Crataegus trachyphylla is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting wildlife."
