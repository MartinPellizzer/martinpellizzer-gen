    "intro": "Celmisia clavata, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that resemble dandelion fluff. Celmisia clavata thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soil. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in alpine ecosystems."
