    "intro": "Chaenostoma leve, commonly known as the small water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its small, white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late summer. Chaenostoma leve plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
