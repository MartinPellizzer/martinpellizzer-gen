    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia subf. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers. The leaves are oval and slightly toothed, with a rounded base, distinguishing it from the typical form of Campanula rotundifolia. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
