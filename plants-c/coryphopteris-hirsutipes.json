    "intro": "Coryphopteris hirsutipes, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sori, are located on the underside of its leaves. Coryphopteris hirsutipes plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
