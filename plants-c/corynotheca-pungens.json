    "intro": "Corynotheca pungens, commonly known as the spiny rock cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Corynotheca pungens is often found growing on rocky substrates, showcasing its adaptability to extreme conditions."
