    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum ciliatum, commonly known as the silky petal orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with intricate patterns that attract pollinators like bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
