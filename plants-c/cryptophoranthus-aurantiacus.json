    "intro": "Cryptophoranthus aurantiacus, commonly known as the orange ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the humid tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. This epiphytic plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on the bark of trees. Its most distinctive feature is its vivid orange flowers, which bloom in late summer. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered a critically endangered species."
