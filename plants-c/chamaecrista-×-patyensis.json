    "intro": "Chamaecrista \u00d7 patyensis, commonly known as the yellow clusterbean, is a hybrid legume species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with small, elliptical leaflets and is often used as a forage crop due to its high protein content. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for cultivation in arid environments. The seed pods are typically hairy and contain small, elliptical seeds that are used in traditional medicine and as a food source."
