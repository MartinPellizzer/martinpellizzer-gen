    "intro": "Chytroma chartacea, commonly known as the parchment lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive, flat, leaf-like thallus with a leathery texture and a pale to dark green or brown coloration. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal partner, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the environment. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecological health."
