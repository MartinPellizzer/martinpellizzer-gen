It belongs to the Celastraceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including rainforests and dry sclerophyllous forests, and is often found in coastal regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural reserves."
