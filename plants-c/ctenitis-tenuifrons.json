    "intro": "Ctenitis tenuifrons, commonly known as the narrow-fronded shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Ctenitis tenuifrons is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid conditions."
