    "intro": "Cerastium spathulatum, commonly known as the broadleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are arranged in a raceme. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a ground cover plant."
