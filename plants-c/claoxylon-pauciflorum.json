    "intro": "Claoxylon pauciflorum, commonly known as the low-flowered claoxylon, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
