    "intro": "Cupania fulva, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and pinnately arranged, and its clusters of small, bright red berries that mature in the fall. The plant produces flowers in the spring, typically in clusters of five to seven, and is often found in moist, woodland habitats. Cupania fulva is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its berries, while attractive, are toxic if consumed raw."
