    "intro": "Ceanothus crassifolius var. planus, commonly known as the flat-leaf ceanothus, is a shrub native to California and parts of Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with thick, leathery leaves that are typically flat and elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, blue to violet flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to tolerate drought conditions."
