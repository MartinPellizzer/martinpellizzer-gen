    "intro": "Coffea paolia, commonly known as the Paolian coffee plant, is a species native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries containing two seeds, which are the coffee beans. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and have a slightly serrated edge. While it is less commercially cultivated than other coffee species, it is valued for its unique flavor profile and potential for sustainable farming."
