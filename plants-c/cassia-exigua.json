It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow, fragrant flowers that are clustered in panicles, typically blooming in the spring. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that turn from green to brown as they mature. Cassia exigua is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
