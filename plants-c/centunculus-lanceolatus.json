    "intro": "Centunculus lanceolatus, commonly known as the lanceleaf moss or narrowleaf centunculus, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in clusters, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Centunculus lanceolatus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect populations."
