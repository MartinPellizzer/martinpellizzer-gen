    "intro": "Caralluma furta, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss and deter herbivores. Caralluma furta is also known for its traditional use in herbal medicine, particularly for its purported appetite-suppressing properties."
