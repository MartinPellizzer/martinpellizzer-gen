    "intro": "Centaurea solstitialis subsp. schouwii, commonly known as the yellow star-thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves with a rough texture and produces small, hard seeds that are easily dispersed by wind. It is often considered an invasive species in North America, where it competes with native vegetation. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and sometimes problematic weed in agricultural and natural areas."
