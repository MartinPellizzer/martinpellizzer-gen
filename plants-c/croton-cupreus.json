    "intro": "Croton cupreus, commonly known as copperleaf, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features vibrant, variegated leaves with a coppery hue that adds visual interest to any garden or indoor space. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters in its natural habitat. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by capsule fruits. Croton cupreus thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
