    "intro": "Corylus avellana f. aurea, commonly known as the golden hazel, is a cultivar of the hazel tree characterized by its striking golden foliage. This ornamental plant is prized for its showy, vibrant leaves that turn a brilliant yellow in the autumn. It produces small, edible nuts similar to those of the common hazel, though its primary value lies in its aesthetic appeal. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. Its unique coloration makes it a popular choice for adding visual interest to parks and private gardens."
