    "intro": "Catasetum callosum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered catasetum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces a unique structure called a \"catacaustic\" which is used in pollination by specific wasps. It prefers warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
