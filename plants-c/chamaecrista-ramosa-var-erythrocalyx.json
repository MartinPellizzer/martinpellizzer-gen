    "intro": "Chamaecrista ramosa var. erythrocalyx, commonly known as the red-flowered ticktree, is a perennial legume native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and pairs of opposite, ovate leaves with a distinctive hairy texture. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, which bloom during the rainy season. Its small, lens-shaped seeds are encased in a hairy pod, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
