    "intro": "Chrysopogon echinulatus, commonly known as the spiny grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear sharp, spiny structures. The plant produces small, pale green to brownish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of certain ecosystems and a potential resource for forage or erosion control."
