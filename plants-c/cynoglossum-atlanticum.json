    "intro": "Cynoglossum atlanticum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant has a rosette-forming habit, with basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. Cynoglossum atlanticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
