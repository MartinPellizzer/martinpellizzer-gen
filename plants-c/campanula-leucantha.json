    "intro": "Campanula leucantha, commonly known as the white bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, white flowers with a delicate, waxy texture. The leaves are lanceolate, with a rough, hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its charming, early summer blooms."
