It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The leaves are typically lobed and have a hairy texture, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
