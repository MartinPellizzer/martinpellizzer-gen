    "intro": "Cestrum conglomeratum, commonly known as the clustered trumpetflower, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. These flowers are pollinated primarily by moths and bats, and the plant is known for its nocturnal blooming habit. Cestrum conglomeratum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
