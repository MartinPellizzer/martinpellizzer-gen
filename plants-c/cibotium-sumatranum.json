    "intro": "Cibotium sumatranum, commonly known as the Sumatran tree fern, is a distinctive member of the Dicksoniaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered with a dense layer of persistent, fibrous roots. The plant produces large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically green on the upper surface and pale underneath. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Cibotium sumatranum plays a crucial role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity."
