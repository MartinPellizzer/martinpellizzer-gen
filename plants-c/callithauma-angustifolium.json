    "intro": "Callithauma angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and windy environments. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters, and it is often found growing in dunes or along the shoreline. Callithauma angustifolium plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
