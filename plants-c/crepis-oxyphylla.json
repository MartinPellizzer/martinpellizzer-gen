    "intro": "Crepis oxyphylla, commonly known as the alpine hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is native to mountainous regions of Europe and is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and small yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are usually basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Crepis oxyphylla is often found in meadows and grasslands at high altitudes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
