    "intro": "Cyathea raciborskii, commonly known as the raciborskii tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the undersides of its fronds. Cyathea raciborskii plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various organisms."
