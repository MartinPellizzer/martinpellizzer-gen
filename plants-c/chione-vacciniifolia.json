    "intro": "Chione vacciniifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf vaccinium, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features small, elliptical leaves that are silver-white on the upper surface and glossy green underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its adaptability to coastal conditions makes it a hardy plant that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Chione vacciniifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to withstand salty air and wind."
