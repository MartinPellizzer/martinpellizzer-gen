    "intro": "Carex granifera, commonly known as the granulate sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and arranged in a dense, compact rosette. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, three-lobed flowers, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. Carex granifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
