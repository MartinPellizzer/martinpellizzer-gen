    "intro": "Cypripedium bulbosum var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow pouch-shaped flower with a distinctive red and yellow pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in rich, humus-filled soils. Its leaves are broad and leathery, and it produces a single, fragrant bloom each year. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered in many areas."
