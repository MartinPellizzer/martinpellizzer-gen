    "intro": "Camptosema tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly camptosema, is a small shrub native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its tactile appeal. Camptosema tomentosum is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or arid landscapes."
