    "intro": "Crotalaria malangensis var. capituliformis, commonly known as the Malang false flax, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that resemble a crown, giving it its varietal name. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven leaflets, and its seed pods are cylindrical and dehiscent. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
