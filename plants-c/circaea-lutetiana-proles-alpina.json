    "intro": "Circaea lutetiana proles alpina, commonly known as the alpine chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has opposite, hairy leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in alpine meadows, rocky slopes, and forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to cold climates and high-altitude conditions."
