It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or well-drained soils. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control. It is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
