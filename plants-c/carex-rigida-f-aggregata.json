    "intro": "Carex rigida f. aggregata, commonly known as the clustered sedge, is a variant of the rigid sedge native to North America. It is a perennial plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is typically found in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, bogs, and stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets that are usually found in clusters, giving it its \"aggregata\" designation. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in poorly drained soils."
