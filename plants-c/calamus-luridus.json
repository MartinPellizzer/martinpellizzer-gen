    "intro": "Calamus luridus, commonly known as the yellow flag or golden reed, is a perennial flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It belongs to the Aroid family (Araceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, arrow-shaped leaves. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe, which is typical of its family. Calamus luridus is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its ecological role in wetland ecosystems is significant."
