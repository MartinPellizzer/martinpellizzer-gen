    "intro": "Cymbachne guineensis subvar. achimotae, commonly known as the African grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and narrow, linear leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used for erosion control and as a forage crop."
