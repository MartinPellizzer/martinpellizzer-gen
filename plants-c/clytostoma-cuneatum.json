    "intro": "Clytostoma cuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed starling vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often clustered in umbels. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive if not managed properly."
