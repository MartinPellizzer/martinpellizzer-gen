    "intro": "Cyanotis adscendens, commonly known as the climbing water hyacinth, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, blue-violet flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typical of the Hydrocharitaceae family. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Cyanotis adscendens is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies."
