    "intro": "Chamaesyce floribunda, commonly known as the flowering sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils along dry streambeds and in desert regions."
