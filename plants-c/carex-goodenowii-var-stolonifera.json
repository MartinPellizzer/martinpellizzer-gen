    "intro": "Carex goodenowii var. stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is notable for its stolons, which allow it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats."
