    "intro": "Carduus nigrescens, commonly known as the blackthorn carduus, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and dark green, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are encased in a hard, prickly pome, which aids in seed dispersal. Carduus nigrescens is often found in dry grasslands and disturbed soils, and it has some medicinal uses in traditional herbal medicine."
