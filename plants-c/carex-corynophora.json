    "intro": "Carex corynophora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. Carex corynophora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
