    "intro": "Cyperus phaeocephalus, commonly known as the black-headed flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its slender, triangular stems are often covered in fine, soft hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. Cyperus phaeocephalus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in wetland ecosystems."
