    "intro": "Cissus serroniana, commonly known as the African dewberry, is a climbing plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often pubescent and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
