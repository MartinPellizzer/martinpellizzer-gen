It features heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are often variegated with white or cream markings. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, grape-like berries that are typically consumed fresh. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil with regular watering. Its rapid growth and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for vertical gardening and indoor spaces."
