    "intro": "Cytisus jankae var. viridis, commonly known as the greenleaf broom, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, bright green leaves that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage, which remains vibrant throughout the growing season."
