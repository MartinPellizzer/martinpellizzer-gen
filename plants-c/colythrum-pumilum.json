    "intro": "Colythrum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It typically reaches a height of only a few inches, with hairy, spreading stems that form dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in five-petaled blooms. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Colythrum pumilum thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
