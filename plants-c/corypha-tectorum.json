It is a tall, slender tree that can grow up to 20 meters in height, with a slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces a distinctive fruit known as the coconut, which contains both water and a white, fleshy interior. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in sandy or coastal soils. The coconut palm plays an important ecological and economic role in tropical regions."
