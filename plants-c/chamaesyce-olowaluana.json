    "intro": "Chamaesyce olowaluana, commonly known as the Olowalu ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
