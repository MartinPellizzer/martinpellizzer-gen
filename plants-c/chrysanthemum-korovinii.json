    "intro": "Chrysanthemum korovinii, commonly known as the Siberian chrysanthemum, is a herbaceous perennial native to the cold climates of eastern Siberia and northern Mongolia. It features a compact growth habit with finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers in the autumn, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
