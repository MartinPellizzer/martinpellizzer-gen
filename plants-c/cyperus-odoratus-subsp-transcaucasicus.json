    "intro": "Cyperus odoratus subsp. transcaucasicus, commonly known as the Caucasian flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as riverbanks and wetlands, and prefers moist, well-drained soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the broader Cyperus odoratus species."
