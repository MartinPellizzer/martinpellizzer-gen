It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has sticky, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid regions."
