    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis subvar. pleno-flore, commonly known as the full-flowered watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense, terminal inflorescences, and it is known for its peppery flavor when the leaves are harvested. This subspecies is distinct from the typical form due to its more abundant and showy floral display."
