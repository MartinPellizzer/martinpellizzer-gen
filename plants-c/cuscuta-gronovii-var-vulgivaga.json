    "intro": "Cuscuta gronovii var. vulgivaga, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hooked tendrils that help it attach to its host. The plant is widespread in temperate regions and can be found on a variety of agricultural and wild plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or mechanical means, allowing it to colonize new areas easily. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants."
