    "intro": "Croton quercetorum, commonly known as the red maple or Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that are followed by winged fruits called samaras. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Croton quercetorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to provide shade in urban landscapes."
