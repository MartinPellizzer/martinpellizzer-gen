    "intro": "Cremanthodium hookeri f. irregulare, commonly known as the irregular thimbleweed, is a rare and distinctive flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
