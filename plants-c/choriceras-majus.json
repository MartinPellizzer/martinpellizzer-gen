    "intro": "Choriceras majus, commonly known as the giant sea hare, is a species of sea slug found in tropical and subtropical marine environments. It belongs to the family Aplysiidae and is characterized by its large, soft body and distinctive coloration. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a gelatinous body covered in a layer of mucus. It feeds primarily on algae and other plant matter, playing a role in marine ecosystem dynamics. Its reproductive system involves external fertilization, with eggs laid in gelatinous masses in the water."
