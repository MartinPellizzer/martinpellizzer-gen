    "intro": "Chaenorhinum exile, commonly known as the slender horned vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and wastelands. It has small, ovate leaves and produces slender, curved pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species in many regions."
