    "intro": "Cerasus matsumurana, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or Matsumura cherry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to Japan and is closely related to other cherry species such as Prunus serrulata. The plant is characterized by its small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the emergence of leaves. Its fruits are small drupes, typically red or dark purple when mature, and are edible but less commonly consumed than other cherry varieties. Cerasus matsumurana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal."
