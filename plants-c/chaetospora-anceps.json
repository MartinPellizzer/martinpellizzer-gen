    "intro": "Chaetospora anceps, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches, where it can float or remain submerged. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the bladders are the primary photosynthetic organs. Chaetospora anceps is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by digesting trapped prey."
