It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, rushes, and grasses. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are wide and flat, with a grass-like appearance, and it produces small, clustered spikelets of brownish flowers. Carex accrescens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
