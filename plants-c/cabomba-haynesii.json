    "intro": "Cabomba haynesii, commonly known as the narrowleaf watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It has finely divided, feathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
