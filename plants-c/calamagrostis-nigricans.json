    "intro": "Calamagrostis nigricans, commonly known as black jointed grass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark purple to black stems, which give it its common name, and its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats. Calamagrostis nigricans is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
