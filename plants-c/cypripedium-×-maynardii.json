    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 maynardii, commonly known as the Maynard's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its large, showy, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white with a yellow or orange lip. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and produces erect, leafy stems that bear the floral spikes. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it thrives in shaded, moist woodland habitats. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
