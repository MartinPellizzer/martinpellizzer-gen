    "intro": "Curcuma thorelii, commonly known as the Thai turmeric or mountain turmeric, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to orange flowers, which are often borne on tall, leafy stems. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and can reach up to 1 meter in length. The rhizomes of Curcuma thorelii are used in traditional medicine and are similar in appearance to common turmeric (Curcuma longa)."
