    "intro": "Cassia glandulosa var. stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf cassia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and yellow, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces elongated, woody pods that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant."
