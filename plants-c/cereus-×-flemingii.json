    "intro": "Cereus \u00d7 flemingii, commonly known as the Queen of the Night, is a hybrid cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and striking, nocturnal flowers that bloom only during the night. The plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. Due to its unique blooming habit and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for collectors and gardeners interested in desert plants."
