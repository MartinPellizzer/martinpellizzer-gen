    "intro": "Crotalaria limosa, commonly known as the swamp crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and compound leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in moist soils. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Crotalaria limosa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in certain agricultural contexts."
