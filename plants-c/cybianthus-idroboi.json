It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a compact, disk-like structure. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
