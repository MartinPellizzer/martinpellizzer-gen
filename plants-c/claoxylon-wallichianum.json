    "intro": "Claoxylon wallichianum, commonly known as the Himalayan ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, dark brown to black bark and its ability to thrive in high-altitude, temperate climates. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, elongated fruits. Due to its hardiness and slow growth, it is valued for its timber and ecological role in mountainous regions."
