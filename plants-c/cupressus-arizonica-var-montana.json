It is characterized by its scale-like leaves and reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
