    "intro": "Crotalaria albida var. kangrensis, commonly known as the white spurred crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive white, spurred flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. The plant has palmate leaves with three to five leaflets, and it produces small, elongated seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
