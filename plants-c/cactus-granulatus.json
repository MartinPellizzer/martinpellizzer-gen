    "intro": "Cactus granulatus, commonly known as the granulate cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in small, rounded tubercles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. Cactus granulatus is well adapted to harsh desert environments, storing water in its succulent stems to survive prolonged dry periods."
