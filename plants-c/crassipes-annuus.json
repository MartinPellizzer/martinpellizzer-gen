It has dark green, waxy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern and produce showy purple flowers. The plant is highly adaptable and can thrive in a variety of water conditions, including stagnant and slow-moving waters. It is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to dense mats covering water surfaces. This growth can significantly impact water quality and aquatic ecosystems."
