It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its structure consists of triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, with small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Carpodinus barteri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
