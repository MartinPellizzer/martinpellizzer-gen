    "intro": "Crataegus abjecta, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which are edible but often used in jams and wines. Crataegus abjecta is valued for its ornamental qualities and also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
