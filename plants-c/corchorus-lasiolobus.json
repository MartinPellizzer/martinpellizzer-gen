It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, woolly, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and have been historically used in traditional medicine. The species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in challenging climates."
