    "intro": "Carex rostrata var. longipalea, commonly known as the long-pale sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. The varietal form longipalea is distinguished by its elongated, slender palea, which is a key feature in its taxonomic classification."
