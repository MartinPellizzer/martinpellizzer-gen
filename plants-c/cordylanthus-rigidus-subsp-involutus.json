    "intro": "Cordylanthus rigidus subsp. involutus, commonly known as the curledleaf woollypod, is a perennial herb native to California. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
