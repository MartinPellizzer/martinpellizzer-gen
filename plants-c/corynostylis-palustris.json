It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in waterlogged soils. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by insects. Corynostylis palustris plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of its wetland environment."
