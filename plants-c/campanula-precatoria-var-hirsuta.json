It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name \"hirsuta,\" meaning \"hairy\" in Latin. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and botanical collections."
