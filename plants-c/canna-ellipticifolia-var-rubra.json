    "intro": "Canna ellipticifolia var. rubra, commonly known as the red-leaf canna, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, elliptic-shaped leaves that are often a deep red or maroon color, providing a dramatic visual contrast to its bright yellow flowers. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences that consist of numerous small, clustered flowers, typical of the Cannaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and water features. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to both horticultural collections and ecological landscapes."
