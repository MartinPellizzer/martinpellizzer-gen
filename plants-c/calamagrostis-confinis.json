    "intro": "Calamagrostis confinis, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluejoint, is a grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. Calamagrostis confinis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
