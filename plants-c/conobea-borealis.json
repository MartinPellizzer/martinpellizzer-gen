    "intro": "Conobea borealis, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand the cold and short growing season of its habitat. Conobea borealis thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments."
