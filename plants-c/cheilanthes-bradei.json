    "intro": "Cheilanthes bradei, commonly known as the Brade's rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows on rocky substrates, often in crevices or on cliffs. The plant has a thick, leathery frond that helps it retain moisture in its dry habitat. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Cheilanthes bradei is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
