    "intro": "Centaurea glaphyrocephala, commonly known as the silverhead centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bristly seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
