It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale, translucent petals. The plant typically grows on tree branches in humid, shaded environments. It has small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
