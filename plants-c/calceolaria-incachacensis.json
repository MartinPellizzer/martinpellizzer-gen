    "intro": "Calceolaria incachacensis, commonly known as the Andean slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Its leaves are usually lanceolate and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Calceolaria incachacensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
