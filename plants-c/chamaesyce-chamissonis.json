    "intro": "Chamaesyce chamissonis, commonly known as the sand spurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal regions. It has small, fleshy, spiny leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It is often found in dunes and along the edges of salt marshes. Its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions makes it an important component of these ecosystems."
