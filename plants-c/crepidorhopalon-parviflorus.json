    "intro": "Crepidorhopalon parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered crepidorhopalon, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters along the stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided lobes that give it a feathery appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
