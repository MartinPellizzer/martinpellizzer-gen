    "intro": "Carex molestiformis, commonly known as the rough sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is native to North America and thrives in moist, often wet environments such as marshes and pond edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically rough to the touch, giving it its common name. Its flowering structure consists of dense, cylindrical spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex molestiformis plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
