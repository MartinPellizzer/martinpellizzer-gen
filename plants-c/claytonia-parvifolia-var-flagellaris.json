    "intro": "Claytonia parvifolia var. flagellaris, commonly known as the flagellate springbeauty, is a delicate flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its small, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its stems are usually hairy and can grow up to 15 centimeters in height, supporting the delicate flowers. This variant is distinguished by its elongated, flagellate-like leaves, which give it its common name and contribute to its unique botanical appearance."
