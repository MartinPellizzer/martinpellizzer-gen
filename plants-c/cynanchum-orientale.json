    "intro": "Cynanchum orientale, commonly known as the oriental milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by follicles that contain toxic, milky sap. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine. However, it is also considered a poisonous plant due to the presence of cardioactive compounds."
