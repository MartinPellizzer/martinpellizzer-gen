    "intro": "Calylophus hartwegii subsp. toumeyi, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss through transpiration. The species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer plant in ecological succession."
