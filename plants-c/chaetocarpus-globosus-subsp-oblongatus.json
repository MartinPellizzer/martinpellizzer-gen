    "intro": "Chaetocarpus globosus subsp. oblongatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive blue to violet flowers that appear in dense, spherical clusters. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in saline environments. This subspecies is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight along shorelines. Its unique floral structure and salt tolerance make it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
