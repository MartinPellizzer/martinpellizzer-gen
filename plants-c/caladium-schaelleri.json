    "intro": "Caladium schaelleri, commonly known as the Sch\u00e4ler's arrowleaf, is a tropical perennial plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that often display vibrant shades of red, pink, and white. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens and indoor spaces. Caladium schaelleri is typically propagated through tuberous roots, which can be planted in spring for optimal growth."
