It belongs to the Cornaceae family and is characterized by its unique leaf venation patterns, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous areas. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers appear in clusters and are accompanied by red bracts that enhance its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
