    "intro": "Carex echinata var. tenuior, commonly known as slender spike sedge, is a perennial plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Its flowers are usually small and greenish, and it produces triangular, three-angled berries. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more slender leaves compared to the typical form of Carex echinata."
