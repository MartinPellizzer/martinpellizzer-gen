    "intro": "Cochlearia cochlearioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cochlearia, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, white or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Cochlearia cochlearioides is an important species for studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
