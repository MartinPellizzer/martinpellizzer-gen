    "intro": "Callistemon lanceolatus var. pendulus, commonly known as the weeping bottlebrush, is a striking evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its pendulous, bright red flowers that resemble bottlebrushes, which bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are grey-green in color and remain throughout the year. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its unique appearance and ecological value make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
