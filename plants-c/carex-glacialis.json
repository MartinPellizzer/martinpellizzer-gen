    "intro": "Carex glacialis, commonly known as the glacial sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude and arctic regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Carex glacialis typically grows close to the ground, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in harsh climates. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce small, wind-pollinated flowers."
