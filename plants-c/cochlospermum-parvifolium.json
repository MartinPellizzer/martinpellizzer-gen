It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a heart-shaped base, while its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. Cochlospermum parvifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
