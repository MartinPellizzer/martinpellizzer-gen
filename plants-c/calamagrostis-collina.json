    "intro": "Calamagrostis collina, commonly known as the silvergrass or bluejoint grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, silver-blue foliage and tall, cylindrical inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and marshy areas. It has fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. Calamagrostis collina is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
