    "intro": "Centaurea lactucifolia var. lactucifolia, commonly known as the lettuce leaf star-thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, lettuce-like leaves and spiny, upright stems that bear blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny environments such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are edible when young, though they become bitter and fibrous with age. It is considered a weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to invade disturbed soils."
