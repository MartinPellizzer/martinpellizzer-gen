    "intro": "Cyathea allocota, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a long lifespan and can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a slow growth rate. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and enabling it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically bright green and can remain on the plant for several years before being replaced."
