    "intro": "Cystopteris montana, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, round groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Cystopteris montana is often found growing in clusters, with its rhizomes spreading horizontally through the soil."
