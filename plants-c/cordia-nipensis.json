It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and scrublands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
