    "intro": "Cerastium soleirolii subsp. soleirolii, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler climates."
