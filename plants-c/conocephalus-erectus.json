    "intro": "Conocephalus erectus, commonly known as the tall clubmoss, is a small evergreen herbaceous plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, scale-like leaves that form dense clusters. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of its branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Conocephalus erectus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
