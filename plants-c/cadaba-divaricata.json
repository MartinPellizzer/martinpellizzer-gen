    "intro": "Cadaba divaricata, commonly known as the African bellflower, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for gardens in arid regions."
