    "intro": "Cacalia suffruticosa, commonly known as the common thimbleweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features a woody base, which gives it its suffruticous classification. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Cacalia suffruticosa is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
