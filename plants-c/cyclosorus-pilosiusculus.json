    "intro": "Cyclosorus pilosiusculus, commonly known as the hairy cyclosorus, is a small, aquatic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is often found in humid, shaded areas where it can thrive without direct sunlight."
