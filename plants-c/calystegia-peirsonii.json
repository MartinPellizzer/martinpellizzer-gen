    "intro": "Calystegia peirsonii, commonly known as the Peirson's morning glory, is a climbing vine native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning. The plant produces showy, pale blue to violet flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, orange-red capsule that splits open when mature. Calystegia peirsonii is often found in disturbed habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
