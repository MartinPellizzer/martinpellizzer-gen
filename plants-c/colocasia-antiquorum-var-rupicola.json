    "intro": "Colocasia antiquorum var. rupicola, commonly known as the rock colocasia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, often with a deep green to almost black coloration. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden areas or indoor cultivation. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its dramatic visual impact. Despite its ornamental value, it is important to note that the plant contains calcium oxalate crystals, which can be toxic if ingested."
