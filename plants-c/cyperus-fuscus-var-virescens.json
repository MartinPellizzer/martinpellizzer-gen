    "intro": "Cyperus fuscus var. virescens, commonly known as the green tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways, preferring moist to aquatic conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. Botanically, it is characterized by its triangular stems and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
