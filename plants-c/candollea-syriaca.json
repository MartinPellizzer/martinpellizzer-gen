    "intro": "Candollea syriaca, commonly known as the Syrian candollea, is a rare and endangered plant native to the mountainous regions of Syria and Turkey. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
