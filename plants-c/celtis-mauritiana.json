    "intro": "Celtis mauritiana, commonly known as the white-fruited hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Cannabaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, white or yellowish fruits that are edible for some animals but not typically for humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in dry woodlands and along riverbanks. Celtis mauritiana is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in agroforestry systems."
