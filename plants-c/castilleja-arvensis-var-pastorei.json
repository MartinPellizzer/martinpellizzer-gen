    "intro": "Castilleja arvensis var. pastorei, commonly known as the pasture milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces bright orange to red flowers, typically in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found in disturbed soils, including agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its presence can indicate soil disturbance or degradation, making it an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
