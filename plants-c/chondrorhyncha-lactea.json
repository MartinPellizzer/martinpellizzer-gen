    "intro": "Chondrorhyncha lactea, commonly known as the milkweed vine, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that are typically arranged in racemes. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, a feature shared with other members of the milkweed family. Chondrorhyncha lactea thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories."
