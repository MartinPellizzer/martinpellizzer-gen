    "intro": "Centaurea arenaria subsp. sophiae, commonly known as the coastal centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its blue to purple flowers and bristly leaves. The plant thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its small, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit help it conserve water and resist wind. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local insect populations."
