    "intro": "Cuscuta boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It has a slender, yellowish stem covered in small, scale-like structures called haustoria, which attach to the host plant and extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and is often found growing on various species of shrubs and trees in South America. It is an annual plant that completes its life cycle within a single growing season. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to its host plants, particularly in agricultural settings."
