    "intro": "Colymbada ebenoides, commonly known as the ebony wood fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that resemble the texture of ebony wood. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, contributing to its structural stability. The fronds are bi-directionally pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily recognizable in its natural habitat."
