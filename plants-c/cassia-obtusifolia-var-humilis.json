    "intro": "Cassia obtusifolia var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf cassia, is a low-growing shrub native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the spring and summer. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that turn brown as they mature. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its compact growth habit and seasonal flowering."
