    "intro": "Chamaecrista rigidifolia, commonly known as rigid thornapple, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its rigid, thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
