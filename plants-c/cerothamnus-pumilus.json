    "intro": "Cerothamnus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf rabbitbrush, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Cerothamnus pumilus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
