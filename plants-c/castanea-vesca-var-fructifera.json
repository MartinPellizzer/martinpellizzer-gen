    "intro": "Castanea vesca var. fructifera, commonly known as the common horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven leaflets and produces large, showy white flowers in early spring. The tree bears spiny, prickly fruits called burrs, each containing one or two smooth, glossy nuts. These nuts are edible when mature but are often used ornamentally due to their aesthetic appeal. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
