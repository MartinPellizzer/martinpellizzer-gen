    "intro": "Ctenitis distans var. isabellina, commonly known as the Isabelline Ctenitis, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, pale green fronds that give it a soft, ethereal appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical forests or on rocky outcrops. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
