    "intro": "Cupania arborea, commonly known as the tree of heaven, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often trifoliate or pinnate, and its small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically covered in a dense layer of hairs. It is often found in moist, tropical or subtropical regions and is known for its rapid growth. Cupania arborea is also notable for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it an invasive species in some areas."
