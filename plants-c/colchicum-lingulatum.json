    "intro": "Colchicum lingulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in woodland areas and shaded rocky habitats, preferring moist, well-drained soils. The plant features basal leaves that are narrow and strap-like, with showy, purple to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its bulbs are toxic and contain colchicine, a compound used in medicine. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
