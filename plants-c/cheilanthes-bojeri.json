It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features thick, leathery leaves that are adapted to arid environments, allowing it to retain moisture efficiently. Its rhizomes are robust and often grow close to the ground, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils. Cheilanthes bojeri is typically found in dry, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental appearance and resilience."
