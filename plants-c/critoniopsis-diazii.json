    "intro": "Critoniopsis diazii, commonly known as the Diazii spurge, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its unique floral structures and milky sap. The plant typically grows as a low, cushion-like shrub with small, fleshy leaves. Its flowers are clustered in cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the spurge family. Due to its adaptability to harsh environments, it is often found in rocky soils and is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic plants."
