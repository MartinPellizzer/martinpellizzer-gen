    "intro": "Cyclosorus sanduensis, commonly known as the Sandu's cyclosorus, is a rare fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in the understory of dense forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive circular pattern on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus sanduensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
