    "intro": "Calonemorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and striking, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many areas. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of both scientific interest and conservation concern."
