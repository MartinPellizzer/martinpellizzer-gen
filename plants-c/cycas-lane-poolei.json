    "intro": "Cycas lane-poolei, commonly known as the Lane-Poole cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the island of New Caledonia and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces both male and female cones, which are essential for its reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts. Its morphology and ecological role make it a significant species in the study of plant evolution and biodiversity."
