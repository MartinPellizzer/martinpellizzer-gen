    "intro": "Cyrtopodium saintlegerianum, commonly known as the Saint Leger's corynephorum, is a species of orchid native to South America. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and undergrowth. The plant features a pseudobulb with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fragrant, yellow-green flowers in late summer. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, and it is often found in rocky or forested areas. The orchid's unique floral structure and growth habits make it a distinctive member of the Cyrtopodium genus."
