    "intro": "Castilleja altorum, commonly known as the tall Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bright red to orange tubular flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for nutrients, often growing on grasses or shrubs. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Castilleja altorum typically thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils."
