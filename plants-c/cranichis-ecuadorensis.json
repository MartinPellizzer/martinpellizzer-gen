    "intro": "Cranichis ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive greenish-yellow coloration and intricate patterns. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
