It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native region."
