    "intro": "Callitris neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonian cedar, is a coniferous tree native to the island of New Caledonia. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves arranged in flat sprays, and its cones are typically woody and globose. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable component of New Caledonia's endemic flora."
