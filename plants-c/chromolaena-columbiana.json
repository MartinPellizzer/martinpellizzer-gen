    "intro": "Chromolaena columbiana, commonly known as the Hawaiian tridax, is a perennial shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in full sun and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open woodlands. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in several regions."
