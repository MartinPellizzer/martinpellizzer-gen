    "intro": "Crucianella angustifolia subsp. oxyloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea bean, is a flowering plant species native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of the Middle East. It is a small shrub characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments and along rocky shores. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release small, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions and its role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
