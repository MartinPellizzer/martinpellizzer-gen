    "intro": "Croton apicifolius, commonly known as the spike-leaved croton, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often sharply pointed leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, spiky fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in some regions for both horticultural and traditional use."
