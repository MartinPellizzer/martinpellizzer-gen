    "intro": "Cotyledon orbiculata var. dactylopsis, commonly known as the elephant's foot or tree of life, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, and often branching stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It blooms with clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged foliage. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for succulent collections."
