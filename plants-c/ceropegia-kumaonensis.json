It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its trailing stems and tubular flowers. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
