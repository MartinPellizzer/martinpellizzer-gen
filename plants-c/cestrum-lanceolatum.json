    "intro": "Cestrum lanceolatum, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a species of flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant is notable for its fragrant, tubular flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white and purple. Its flowers are pollinated by moths and bats, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but somewhat tart. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and nocturnal blooming habit."
