    "intro": "Crinum arenarium var. blandum, commonly known as the sand crinum. It is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa, characterized by its strap-like, aromatic leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in dune environments. It produces an underground bulb that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, arid conditions. The flowers typically bloom in late summer or early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths."
