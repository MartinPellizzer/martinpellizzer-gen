    "intro": "Callitriche antarctica, commonly known as Antarctic starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to cold regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as lakes, streams, and wetlands. The plant has tiny, star-shaped leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually white or pale blue, and it reproduces both sexually and through vegetative propagation. This species is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate low light conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
