    "intro": "Cleome trachysperma, commonly known as spider flower, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range from white to pink or red. The plant produces distinctive, inflated seed pods that split open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Cleome trachysperma is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
