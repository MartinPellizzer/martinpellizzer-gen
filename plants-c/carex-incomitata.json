    "intro": "Carex incomitata, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. Carex incomitata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability."
