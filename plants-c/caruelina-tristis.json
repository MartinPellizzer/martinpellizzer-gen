    "intro": "Caruelina tristis, commonly known as the weeping brookweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Hydrocharitaceae family, which includes aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often near streams and ponds. Its leaves are elongated and ribbon-like, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Caruelina tristis produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer."
