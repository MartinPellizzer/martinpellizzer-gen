It features compound leaves with a distinctive stinging hair structure, which can cause irritation upon contact. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are covered in fine, sticky hairs, and it thrives in partial to full sun with well-drained soil. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a naturalizer in woodland areas."
