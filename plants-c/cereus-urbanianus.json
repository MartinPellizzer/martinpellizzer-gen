    "intro": "Cereus urbanianus, commonly known as the Urbanian candleplant, is a species of cactus native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces large, white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, a trait common among many cacti adapted to nocturnal pollination. Its spines are relatively short and sparse, giving it a more delicate appearance compared to other cereus species. Cereus urbanianus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with minimal water."
