    "intro": "Cypripedium franchetii, commonly known as the Franchet's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-shaped lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its botanical features include a pseudobulb and long, strap-like leaves, which help it survive in its cool, humid environment. Due to its rarity and beauty, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
