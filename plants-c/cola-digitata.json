    "intro": "Cola digitata, commonly known as the African cola tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to West Africa. It belongs to the Sterculiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, compound leaves. The plant is notable for its fruit, which contains seeds surrounded by a pulp that is used to produce caffeine-containing beverages. Cola digitata thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Its ecological and economic importance is significant, particularly in regions where it is harvested for its seeds and medicinal properties."
