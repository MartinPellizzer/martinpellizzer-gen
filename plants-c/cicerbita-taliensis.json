    "intro": "Cicerbita taliensis, commonly known as the Taliensian cicerbit, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often found in rocky or forested habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
