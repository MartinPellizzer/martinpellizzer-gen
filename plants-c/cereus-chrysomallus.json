    "intro": "Cereus chrysomallus, commonly known as the yellow night bloomer, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically yellow or white, which open at night. These flowers emit a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Cereus chrysomallus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique blooming habit."
