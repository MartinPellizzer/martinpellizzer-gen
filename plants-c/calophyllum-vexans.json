    "intro": "Calophyllum vexans, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and exudes a fragrant resin when cut. The plant thrives in saline environments, often forming dense thickets in mangrove swamps. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a waxy texture to reduce water loss. Calophyllum vexans plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
