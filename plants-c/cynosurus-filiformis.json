    "intro": "Cynosurus filiformis, commonly known as slender hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats on moist soils, often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has fine, thread-like leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in width, giving it a delicate appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. Cynosurus filiformis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
