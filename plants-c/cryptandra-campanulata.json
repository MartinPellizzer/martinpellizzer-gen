    "intro": "Cryptandra campanulata, commonly known as the bell-shaped cryptandra, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water conservation. Cryptandra campanulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
