    "intro": "Conchium corniculatum, commonly known as the horned lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched thallus with a yellowish to orange-brown coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is typically found on rocks, tree bark, and soil in temperate regions. Conchium corniculatum is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
