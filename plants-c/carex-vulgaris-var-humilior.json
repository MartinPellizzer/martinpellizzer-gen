    "intro": "Carex vulgaris var. humilior, commonly known as the low sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, temperate regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that form dense clumps, and its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-ranked spikes. It produces wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
