    "intro": "Caryochloa setifolia, commonly known as the silky blue grass, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, blue-gray foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a soft, silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Caryochloa setifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
