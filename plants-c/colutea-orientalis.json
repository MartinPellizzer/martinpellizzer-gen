    "intro": "Colutea orientalis, commonly known as the oriental broomrape, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true stems. Colutea orientalis is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants."
