    "intro": "Crocus praecox, commonly known as the early crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, white, and orange, typically blooming in early spring before many other flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky soils or open woodlands. Its bulbs are adapted for storage and can remain dormant for extended periods. Crocus praecox is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
