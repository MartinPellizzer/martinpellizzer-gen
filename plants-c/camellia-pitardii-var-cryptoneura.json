    "intro": "Camellia pitardii var. cryptoneura, commonly known as the narrow-leaf camellia, is a rare and ornamental evergreen shrub native to southern China. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often narrower than those of other camellia species. The plant produces showy, camellia-like flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It prefers well-drained, acidic soil and partial shade, making it suitable for garden cultivation in temperate climates. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often sought after by botanists and horticulturists."
