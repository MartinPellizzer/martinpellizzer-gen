    "intro": "Chenopodina microsperma, commonly known as the dwarf goosefoot, is a small annual herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with succulent, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, followed by tiny, spherical seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are usually glaucous, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Chenopodina microsperma is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry fields."
