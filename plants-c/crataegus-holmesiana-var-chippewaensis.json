    "intro": "Crataegus holmesiana var. chippewaensis, commonly known as the Chippewa hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pink flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and the plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
