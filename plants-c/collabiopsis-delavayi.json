    "intro": "Collabiopsis delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, adherent layer on rock surfaces, typically in montane or alpine environments. The thallus is usually pale yellow to orange in color, with a granular texture and distinct isidiate and sorediate structures. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found on siliceous substrates such as granite or limestone. This lichen is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in soil formation and its sensitivity to environmental changes."
