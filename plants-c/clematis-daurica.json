The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, moist soil. Clematis daurica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens and as a climbing plant."
