    "intro": "Citrus combara var. macroptera, commonly known as the large-fruited citron. It is a variant of the citron species native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its large, fragrant fruits that can weigh up to several kilograms. The plant is a small to medium-sized tree with thick, dark green leaves and thorn-like branches. Its flowers are pale yellow and produce a high quantity of nectar, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent, though it is not typically consumed raw due to its high acidity."
