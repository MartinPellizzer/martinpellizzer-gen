It produces vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and purple. The plant has a trailing growth habit and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. It is adapted to withstand drought and can regrow after fires, hence its common name. Its botanical features include hairy stems, alternate leaves, and capsule fruits that release seeds explosively."
