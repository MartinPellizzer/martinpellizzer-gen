    "intro": "Cotyledon platyphylla, commonly known as the flatleaf cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a waxy texture to store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in arid environments. Cotyledon platyphylla is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
