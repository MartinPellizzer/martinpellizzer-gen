    "intro": "Cerasus pallida, commonly known as the pale cherry or Japanese white cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its fruits are small, red drupes that mature in summer. Cerasus pallida is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and is also used in traditional Japanese culture."
