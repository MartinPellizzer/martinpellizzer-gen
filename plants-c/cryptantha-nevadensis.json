    "intro": "Cryptantha nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in high elevation areas of California and Nevada. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, such as meadows and slopes, where it thrives in full sun. Cryptantha nevadensis has small, narrow leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is an indicator species for alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
