    "intro": "Chamaecrista seticrenata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf burr legume, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and compound leaves with small, opposite leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, followed by elongated, spiny pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dry forests. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
