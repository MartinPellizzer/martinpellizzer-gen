    "intro": "Caesalpinia myabensis var. hermeliae, commonly known as the Hermelie's flame tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange pods that resemble flames, which are a distinctive botanical feature. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its vibrant foliage and showy blooms. The leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, adding to its complex and attractive appearance."
