It consists of several species, most notably Clarionia falcata, which is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Clarionia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and vibrant blooms."
