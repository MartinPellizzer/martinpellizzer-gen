    "intro": "Calanticaria oligantha, commonly known as the spiny dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features rough, hairy stems and lobed, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring, and it produces small, spiky seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Calanticaria oligantha is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
