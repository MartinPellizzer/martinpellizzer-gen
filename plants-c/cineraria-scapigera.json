    "intro": "Cineraria scapigera, commonly known as the rock cineraria, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring, adding a splash of color to rocky landscapes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses."
