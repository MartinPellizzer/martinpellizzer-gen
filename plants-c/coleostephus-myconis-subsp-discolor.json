    "intro": "Coleostephus myconis subsp. discolor, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically features dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions."
