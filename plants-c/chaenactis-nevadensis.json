    "intro": "Chaenactis nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada painted scale, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a small, herbaceous annual with a compact rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves. The plant produces delicate, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, alpine environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
