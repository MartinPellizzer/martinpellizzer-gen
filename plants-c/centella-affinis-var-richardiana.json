    "intro": "Centella affinis var. richardiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf centella, is a creeping perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense mats. It is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing effects."
