    "intro": "Clavija lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's clavija, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. It produces small, often yellow or greenish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Clavija lehmannii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
