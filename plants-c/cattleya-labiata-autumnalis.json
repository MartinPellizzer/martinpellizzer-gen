    "intro": "Cattleya labiata autumnalis, commonly known as the Autumn Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in the autumn season, hence its common name. The plant features broad, waxy leaves and produces fragrant, pendulous blossoms in shades of pink, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is popular among horticulturists for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
