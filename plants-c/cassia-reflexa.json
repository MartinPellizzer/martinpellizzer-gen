    "intro": "Cassia reflexa, commonly known as the weeping cassia, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its long, pendulous leaves that give it a distinctive weeping appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, spiny pod that splits open when mature. Cassia reflexa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun."
