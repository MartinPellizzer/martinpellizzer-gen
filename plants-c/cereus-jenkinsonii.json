    "intro": "Cereus jenkinsonii, commonly known as the Jenkinson's candleplant, is a succulent cactus native to South America. It features a tall, unbranched stem with a cylindrical shape and a spiny, ribbed surface. The plant produces large, white, funnel-shaped flowers at the apex during the night. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for collectors and xerophytic gardens."
