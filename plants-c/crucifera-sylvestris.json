    "intro": "Crucifera sylvestris, commonly known as wild mustard, is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its four-petaled flowers and pods that split open to release seeds. It is a herbaceous plant typically found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. The plant has serrated leaves and produces small, yellow or white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily across various habitats. Due to its hardy nature, Crucifera sylvestris is often considered an invasive species in some regions."
