    "intro": "Cordia corylifolia, commonly known as Chinese tallowtree or sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed surrounded by a fleshy, orange-red aril. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions for its rapid growth and ecological benefits. However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
