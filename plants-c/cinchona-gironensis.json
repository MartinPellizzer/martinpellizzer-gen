    "intro": "Cinchona gironensis, commonly known as the Colombian quina, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of Colombia and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces bright red, elliptical berries that contain the seeds. It is closely related to other cinchona species, which are the source of quinine, a compound used in malaria treatment. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, Cinchona gironensis is cultivated in some botanical gardens and conservation programs."
