    "intro": "Cordia setigera, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has distinctive, opposite, oval-shaped leaves and develops red, fleshy berries that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often forming dense thickets in mangrove ecosystems. Its roots play a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion."
