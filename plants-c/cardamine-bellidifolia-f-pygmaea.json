    "intro": "Cardamine bellidifolia f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its foliage is often finely dissected, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. This ferny form is a distinguishing trait of the pygmaea form, which is smaller than the typical species."
