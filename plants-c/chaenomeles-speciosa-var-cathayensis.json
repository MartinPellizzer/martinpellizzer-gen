It is characterized by its showy, rose-like flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces red or orange fruits in the fall, which are edible but often used in traditional Chinese medicine. Its leaves are simple and ovate, with a smooth texture, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its seasonal blooms."
