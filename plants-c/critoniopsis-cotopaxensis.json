    "intro": "Critoniopsis cotopaxensis, commonly known as the Cotopaxi orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers that bloom in the cool, humid climate of its native habitat. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes or in forested areas, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its morphology includes slender stems and lance-shaped leaves adapted to its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
