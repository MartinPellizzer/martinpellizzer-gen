    "intro": "Cyathea petiolata, commonly known as the long-stemmed tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots and a crown of large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its fronds are typically dark green and can reach lengths of up to several meters. Cyathea petiolata plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various organisms."
