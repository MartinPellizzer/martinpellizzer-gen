It is characterized by its thorny stems and pinnate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by fleshy, orange-red fruits resembling dates. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. The fruit is edible, though typically consumed when fully ripe, and has a sweet, tangy flavor."
