    "intro": "Cyclosorus praetervisus, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique circular pattern along the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus praetervisus is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
