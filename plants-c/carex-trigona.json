    "intro": "Carex trigona, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like flower clusters. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it often grows in wet or moist soils, such as marshes and along stream banks. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Carex trigona is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
