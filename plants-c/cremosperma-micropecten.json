    "intro": "Cremosperma micropecten, commonly known as the small-pinnate cremosperma, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by pods that contain several seeds. Native to South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
