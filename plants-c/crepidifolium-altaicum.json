    "intro": "Crepidifolium altaicum, commonly known as the Alaska mountain fern, is a perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically biennial, with the first year producing only leaves and the second year bearing spores. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forested areas or along streams. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The spores are released from small, round structures called sorus, which are located on the undersides of the fronds."
