    "intro": "Carex limosa var. oblonga, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually brown or reddish, arranged in spikelets along the stem. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. This variant is distinguished by its elongated, narrow leaves compared to the typical form of Carex limosa."
