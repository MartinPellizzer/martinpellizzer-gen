    "intro": "Cyclosorus berroi, commonly known as the yellow stinkhorn, is a unique fungal plant that belongs to the Phallales order. It is characterized by its distinctive, foul-smelling spore sac, which attracts flies for spore dispersal. The fungus typically grows on decaying organic matter, such as wood or leaf litter, in moist environments. Its life cycle involves a basidiomycete structure with a club-shaped basidium that produces spores. The plant's morphology includes a short, thick stalk and a cup-like structure that develops into the spore-producing organ."
