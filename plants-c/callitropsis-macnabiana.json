    "intro": "Callitropsis macnabiana, commonly known as the Macnab's cypress, is a rare and unique conifer native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and scale-like leaves that are tightly packed along its branches. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of conifers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
