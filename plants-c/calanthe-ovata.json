It is characterized by its broad, ovate-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often epiphytic on tree trunks or stones. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. Calanthe ovata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
