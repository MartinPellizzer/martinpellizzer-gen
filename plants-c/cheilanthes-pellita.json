    "intro": "Cheilanthes pellita, commonly known as the rock fern or slender rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows on rocky outcrops and in arid environments. The plant has a compact, upright growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a thick, waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. Cheilanthes pellita is valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
