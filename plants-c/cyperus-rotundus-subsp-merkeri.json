    "intro": "Cyperus rotundus subsp. merkeri, commonly known as purple flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green color, while the flowers are typically brown or purple in hue. This subspecies is often found in wetland environments, including marshes and along the edges of water bodies. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction."
