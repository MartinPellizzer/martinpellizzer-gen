    "intro": "Cynara hortensis, commonly known as globe artichoke, is a thistle-like plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, spiny leaves that form a dense rosette around the central stem. The plant produces a unique flower head composed of many small, scale-like bracts that enclose the true flowers. The edible part of the plant is the immature flower head, which is harvested before it fully opens. It is valued for its nutritional content and is widely cultivated for culinary use."
