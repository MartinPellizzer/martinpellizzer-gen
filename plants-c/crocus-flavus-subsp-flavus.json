    "intro": "Crocus flavus subsp. flavus, commonly known as the yellow crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and vibrant yellow flowers with six petals. The flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, often before the leaves emerge, making it one of the earliest flowering plants in the crocus genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for centuries in gardens and botanical collections."
