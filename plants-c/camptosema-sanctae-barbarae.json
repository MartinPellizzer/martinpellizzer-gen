    "intro": "Camptosema sanctae-barbarae, commonly known as the sacred mountain bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant found in high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies."
