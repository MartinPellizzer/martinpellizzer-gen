    "intro": "Campanula napuligera f. longisepala, commonly known as the long-sepaled bellflower, is a rare and striking variant of the campanula genus. It is characterized by its elongated, showy sepals that give it a distinctive appearance compared to typical campanula species. The plant produces bell-shaped, violet to blue flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a unique visual element to its habitat. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, often found in mountainous regions of Europe. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species."
