    "intro": "Calorophus exsulcus, commonly known as the desert flamebush, is a shrub native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, ribbed leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its small, woody stems are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss. Calorophus exsulcus plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
