    "intro": "Cynorkis breviplectra, commonly known as the short-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to certain regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting it to its often arid or semi-arid environment. Its leaves are usually short and broad, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. The flowers are often fragrant and come in shades of white, pink, or purple, making it a visually striking addition to botanical collections."
