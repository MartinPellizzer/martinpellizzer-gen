    "intro": "Calanthe succedanea, commonly known as the evergreen calanthe, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant features broad, leathery leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Calanthe succedanea is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouse settings."
