    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 andrewsii var. landonii, commonly known as the Landon's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a pinkish or reddish lip with a yellow or white throat. The plant grows in shaded, moist habitats, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
