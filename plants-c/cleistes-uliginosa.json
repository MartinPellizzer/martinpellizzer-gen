    "intro": "Cleistes uliginosa, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, hooded flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and requires consistent moisture, often found in bogs or marshes. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, such as flies and beetles, due to their unique shape and scent. Cleistes uliginosa is a rare and endangered species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
