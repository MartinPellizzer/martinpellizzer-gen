    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nauseosus subsp. arenarius, commonly known as the desert sneezeweed, is a member of the Compositae family and is native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and sandy soils. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces yellow flowers in composite heads, which are characteristic of the daisy family. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. The subspecies areniarius is distinguished by its more compact growth form and smaller, more densely packed foliage compared to other subspecies."
