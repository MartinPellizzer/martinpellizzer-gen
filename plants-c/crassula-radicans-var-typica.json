    "intro": "Crassula radicans var. typica, commonly known as the creeping crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, upright stems that often trail or cascade when grown in hanging baskets. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are thick and succulent, adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
