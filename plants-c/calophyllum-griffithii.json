    "intro": "Calophyllum griffithii, commonly known as the yellow sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, glossy green leaves. The tree produces yellowish flowers followed by woody, spiny capsules containing aromatic seeds. It is valued for its timber, which is used in furniture and traditional crafts, and for its essential oils. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
