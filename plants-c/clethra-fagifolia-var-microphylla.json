    "intro": "Clethra fagifolia var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved sweet pepperbush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
