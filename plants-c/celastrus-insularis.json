    "intro": "Celastrus insularis, commonly known as the island bindweed, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It is a member of the Celastraceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain areas."
