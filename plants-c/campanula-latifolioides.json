    "intro": "Campanula latifolioides, commonly known as the broad-leaf bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features broad, ovate leaves with a hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Campanula latifolioides is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
