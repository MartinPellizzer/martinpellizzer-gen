    "intro": "Cerasus kulabensis, commonly known as the Kulab cherry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and the fruit is a small, red cherry-like berry. Cerasus kulabensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in local traditional medicine."
