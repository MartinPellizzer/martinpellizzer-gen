    "intro": "Copiapoa echinata var. pulla, commonly known as the Puna cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring. It is adapted to extreme aridity, storing water in its thick stems and having a slow growth rate. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in arid gardens as an ornamental plant."
