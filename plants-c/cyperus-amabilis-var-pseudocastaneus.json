    "intro": "Cyperus amabilis var. pseudocastaneus, commonly known as the golden bulb sedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, thriving in areas with standing water. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a useful wetland plant and a potential weed. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats."
