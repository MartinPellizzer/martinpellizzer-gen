    "intro": "Cenchrus pauciflorus var. longispinus, commonly known as the long-spined sand couch, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in poor, sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with spikelets bearing bristle-like awns. Its drought tolerance and rapid establishment make it a valuable forage species in harsh environments. The long, stiff spines on its seeds aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing."
