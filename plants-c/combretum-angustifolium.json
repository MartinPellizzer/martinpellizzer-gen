    "intro": "Combretum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf combretum, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a distinctive reddish or brownish underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
