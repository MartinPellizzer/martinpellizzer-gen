    "intro": "Crassula cultrata var. typica, commonly known as the Shingle Plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa. It features compact, rounded rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid conditions and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
