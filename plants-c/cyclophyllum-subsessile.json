    "intro": "Cyclophyllum subsessile, commonly known as the sessile cyclophyllum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green fruits that mature in the summer months. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female blooms, and it relies on insect pollination for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cyclophyllum subsessile is considered a species of conservation concern."
