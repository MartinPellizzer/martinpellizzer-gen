    "intro": "Columnea scandens var. vicentina, commonly known as the silver vine, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a vigorous climber with opposite, ovate leaves that have a distinctive silvery-blue underside. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract hummingbirds and other pollinators. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and vibrant blooms."
