    "intro": "Cedrus alternifolia, commonly known as the Atlas cedar, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown. The tree has scale-like leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches, giving it its scientific name. Its cones are woody and contain small, winged seeds. The bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions."
