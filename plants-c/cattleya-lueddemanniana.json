    "intro": "Cattleya lueddemanniana, commonly known as the Lueddemanniana Cattleya, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, fragrant, and showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant has thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water, allowing it to thrive in drier conditions. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. This species is highly prized by orchid growers for its beauty and fragrance."
