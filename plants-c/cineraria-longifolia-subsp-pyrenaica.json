    "intro": "Cineraria longifolia subsp. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean cineraria, is a perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves and showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, often in mountainous regions. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ornamental value in gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some areas."
