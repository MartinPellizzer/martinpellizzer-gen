    "intro": "Carex buxbaumii var. mutica, commonly known as the Buxbaum's sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes, which are usually borne on short, leafy stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
