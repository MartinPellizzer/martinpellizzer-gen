    "intro": "Chiloglottis platyptera, commonly known as the broad-leaved duckbill, is an epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and distinctive, fleshy, duckbill-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, relying on its host for support rather than soil. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a prominent, fleshy spur. Chiloglottis platyptera is adapted to humid, shaded environments and plays a role in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators."
