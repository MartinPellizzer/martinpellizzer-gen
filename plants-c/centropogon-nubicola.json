    "intro": "Centropogon nubicola, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a herbaceous annual that thrives in hot, dry environments with minimal water availability. The plant features hairy, branching stems and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine pubescence, aiding in water retention. Centropogon nubicola is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
