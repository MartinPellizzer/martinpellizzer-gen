    "intro": "Casuarina cristata subsp. pauper, commonly known as the slender bottlebrush, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of feathery flowers that resemble bottle brushes, typically blooming in spring. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or sandy soils. The subspecies pauper is distinguished by its smaller size and more sparse foliage compared to other forms of Casuarina cristata."
