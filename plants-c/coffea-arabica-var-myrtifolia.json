    "intro": "Coffea arabica var. myrtifolia, commonly known as the myrtle-leaved coffee, is a variant of the arabica coffee species characterized by its distinctive myrtle-like foliage. It is native to Ethiopia and grows at high altitudes, typically between 1,500 and 2,000 meters above sea level. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds used for coffee production. Its leaves are elongated and have a leathery texture, often with a slightly serrated edge. This variety is less commonly cultivated than other coffee types but is valued for its unique flavor profile and aromatic qualities."
