    "intro": "Carex lasiocarpa var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the hairy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable environments."
