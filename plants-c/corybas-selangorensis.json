It is characterized by its unique, hood-shaped flower that resembles a cup, typically ranging in color from green to brown. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces a single, erect stem with a few leaves. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a specialized structure that aids in pollination by specific insects. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky areas."
