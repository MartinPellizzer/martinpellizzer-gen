    "intro": "Cordia faulknerae, commonly known as the Falkner's cordia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features simple, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, fleshy, orange-red berries. These berries are an important food source for local wildlife, including birds and small mammals. Cordia faulknerae is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments."
