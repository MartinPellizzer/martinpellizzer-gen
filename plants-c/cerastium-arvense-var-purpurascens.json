    "intro": "Cerastium arvense var. purpurascens, commonly known as purple sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters and features basal rosettes of fleshy, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are usually rounded and covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along fence rows."
