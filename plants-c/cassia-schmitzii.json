    "intro": "Cassia schmitzii, commonly known as Schmitz's cassia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and are accompanied by narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Cassia schmitzii is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps it survive in drought conditions. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and can be used for ornamental purposes or in traditional medicine."
