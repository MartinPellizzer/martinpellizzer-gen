    "intro": "Convolvulus arvensis var. crassifolius, commonly known as broadleaf field bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are broader and more robust compared to the typical variety of Convolvulus arvensis. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and extensive root system make it an invasive species in many regions."
