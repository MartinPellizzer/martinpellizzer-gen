    "intro": "Cylindropuntia \u00d7 cardenche, commonly known as the Cardenche cholla, is a hybrid cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, segmented stems that are covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. Its growth habit is clump-forming, with each segment capable of producing new shoots. Cylindropuntia \u00d7 cardenche is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
