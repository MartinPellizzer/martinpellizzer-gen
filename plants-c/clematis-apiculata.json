    "intro": "Clematis apiculata, commonly known as the woolly clematis, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It is a perennial vine that produces showy, blue to purple flowers with a distinctive woolly covering on its stems and leaves. The plant thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its foliage is often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps to retain moisture and protect against harsh weather conditions. Clematis apiculata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and unique texture."
