    "intro": "Crepis macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are broad, hairy, and often have a distinctive heart-shaped base. The showy yellow flowers appear in late summer and are followed by small, prickly achenes that aid in seed dispersal."
