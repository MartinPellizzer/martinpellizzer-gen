    "intro": "Ctenodon chicocesarianus, commonly known as the Chicocesian feather fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to the humid forests of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble soft, flowing hair, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures are specialized, with spores produced in small, clustered sporangia along the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ctenodon chicocesarianus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
