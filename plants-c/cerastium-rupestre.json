    "intro": "Cerastium rupestre, commonly known as rock chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. It has a mat-forming growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, wind-swept conditions. Cerastium rupestre is also known for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
