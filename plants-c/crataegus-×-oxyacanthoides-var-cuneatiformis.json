    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 oxyacanthoides var. cuneatiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hawthorn, is a hybrid shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are often reddish or bronze in color during the growing season. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in spring, which are followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage color changes and fruit display, though it is less commonly cultivated than other hawthorn species."
