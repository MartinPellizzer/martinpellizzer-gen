    "intro": "Cyrtorchis helicocalcar, commonly known as the spiral-lip orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its unique spiral-shaped lip, which is a distinguishing botanical feature. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and pale, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cyrtorchis helicocalcar is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
