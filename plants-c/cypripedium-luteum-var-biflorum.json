    "intro": "Cypripedium luteum var. biflorum, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow pouch-like flower with a distinctive red and yellow pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single or two flowers per stem. This orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also of interest in botanical research due to its unique pollination mechanisms."
