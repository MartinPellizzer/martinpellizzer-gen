    "intro": "Colchicum amphigaripense, commonly known as the Armenian colchicum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Colchicaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has basal leaves that are broad and often have a waxy texture, and it produces a single flower stalk that rises from the base. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
