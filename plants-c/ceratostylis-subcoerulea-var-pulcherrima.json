    "intro": "Ceratostylis subcoerulea var. pulcherrima, commonly known as the Blue Orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. This orchid is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers with a white center, which are often adorned with intricate patterns. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-draining soil. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less-than-ideal conditions."
