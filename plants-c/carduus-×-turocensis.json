    "intro": "Carduus \u00d7 turocensis, commonly known as the Hungarian thistle, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Carduus maximus and Carduus acanthoides. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. The plant is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, purple to pinkish composite flower heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many regions."
