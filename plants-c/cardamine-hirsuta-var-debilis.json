    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta var. debilis, commonly known as the slender watercress, is a herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, alternate leaves that resemble those of its parent species. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically borne on slender stems. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing a distinctive texture. This variety is less robust than the typical Cardamine hirsuta and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
