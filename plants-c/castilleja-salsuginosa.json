    "intro": "Castilleja salsuginosa, commonly known as the saltbush castilleja, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually small, linear, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Castilleja salsuginosa thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils."
