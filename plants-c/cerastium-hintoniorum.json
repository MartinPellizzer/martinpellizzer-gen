    "intro": "Cerastium hintoniorum, commonly known as Hinton's chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically oval to ovate in shape. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer, which are followed by small, rounded capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Cerastium hintoniorum is often found in temperate regions of Europe and is noted for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting insect life."
