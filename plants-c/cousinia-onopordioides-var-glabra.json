    "intro": "Cousinia onopordioides var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. It has a compact growth habit and can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters. The smooth, hairless stems and leaves distinguish this variety from other members of the genus."
