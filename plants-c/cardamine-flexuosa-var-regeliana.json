    "intro": "Cardamine flexuosa var. regeliana, commonly known as the Regel's watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a serrated margin and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to other members of the Brassicaceae family."
