It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring four prominent ridges on its petals and sepals, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive yellow or orange lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species in botanical research and conservation efforts."
