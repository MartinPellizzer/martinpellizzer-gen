It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated as a forage crop or ornamental plant."
