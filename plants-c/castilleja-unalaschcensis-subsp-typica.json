    "intro": "Castilleja unalaschcensis subsp. typica, commonly known as the Alaska paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the subarctic and alpine regions of North America. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a slender, branching stem and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It forms symbiotic relationships with certain root fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil. This species is adapted to nutrient-poor environments and is often found in open, rocky habitats."
