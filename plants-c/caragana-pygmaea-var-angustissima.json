    "intro": "Caragana pygmaea var. angustissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf burr sage, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
