    "intro": "Canthium lycioides, commonly known as the redroot false nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, clustered white to pale yellow flowers that are often followed by distinctive, spiny, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Canthium lycioides is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
