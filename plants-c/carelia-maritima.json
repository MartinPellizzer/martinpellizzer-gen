    "intro": "Carelia maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray leaves that are adapted to salty, windy environments. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its leaves have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss, and its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Carelia maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting coastal biodiversity."
