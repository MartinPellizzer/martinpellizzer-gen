    "intro": "Coryphopteris vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Tonga and Fiji. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests or on rocky outcrops. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor soils. The Vitiensis fern plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various organisms."
