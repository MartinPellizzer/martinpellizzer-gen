    "intro": "Carex tomentosa f. nordmannii, commonly known as the Nordmann's tufted sedge, is a variant of the tufted sedge native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit. The plant features narrow, cylindrical leaves covered in a fine, woolly layer of hair, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky slopes. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological adaptation to high-altitude habitats."
