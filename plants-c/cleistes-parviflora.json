It is characterized by its unique, closed flowers that remain concealed for most of the plant's life cycle. The plant produces a single, fleshy, berry-like fruit that contains a single seed. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. Cleistes parviflora is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps."
