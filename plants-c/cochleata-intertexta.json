    "intro": "Cochleata intertexta, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique spiral-shaped inflorescence, which consists of tightly coiled, overlapping flower clusters. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom sequentially along the spiral structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Cochleata intertexta is considered a conservation concern in its natural range."
