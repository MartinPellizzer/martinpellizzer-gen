    "intro": "Centaurea paniculata subsp. micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved globemallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, and it produces dense, spherical clusters of yellow flowers with red-brown bracts. The leaves are lanceolate, often with a hairy texture, and are arranged alternately along the stem. This subspecies is characterized by its smaller, more compact flower heads compared to other members of the species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
