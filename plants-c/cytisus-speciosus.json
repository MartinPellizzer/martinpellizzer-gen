    "intro": "Cytisus speciosus, commonly known as the sweet pea shrub, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, often thorny stems. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which are rich in nectar and attract various pollinators. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant has a woody structure with a strong, aromatic scent. Cytisus speciosus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
