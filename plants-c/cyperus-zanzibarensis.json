It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces three-sided, boat-shaped seeds. Cyperus zanzibarensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
