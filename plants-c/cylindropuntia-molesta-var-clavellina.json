The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in desert ecosystems."
