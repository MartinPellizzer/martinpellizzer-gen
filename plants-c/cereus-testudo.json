    "intro": "Cereus testudo, commonly known as the testudine cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming at night. Its stems are covered in a thick layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant is well adapted to desert conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems and having a shallow root system."
