    "intro": "Caltha palustris var. minor, commonly known as the lesser marsh marigold, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has lance-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with wet conditions."
