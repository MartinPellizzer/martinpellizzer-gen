It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and along water bodies. Its inflorescence consists of dense clusters of small, three-lobed flowers, which are often reddish in color. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
