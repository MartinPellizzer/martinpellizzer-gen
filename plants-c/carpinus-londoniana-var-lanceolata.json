    "intro": "Carpinus londoniana var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf hornbeam, is a variant of the hornbeam tree native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are typically dark green and have a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens. Its hardy nature and ability to tolerate urban environments make it a popular choice for landscaping."
