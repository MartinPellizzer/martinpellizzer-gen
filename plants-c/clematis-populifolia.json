    "intro": "Clematis populifolia, commonly known as the mapleleaf clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped, maple-like leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in diameter, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, usually in shades of white or pale blue. It thrives in partial to full sun and prefers well-drained, fertile soil. Clematis populifolia is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often used in gardens for its vertical growth habit."
