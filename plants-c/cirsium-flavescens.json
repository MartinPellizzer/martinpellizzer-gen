    "intro": "Cirsium flavescens, commonly known as the yellow thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, leafy stems and striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets. Cirsium flavescens is valued for its ornamental qualities and plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
