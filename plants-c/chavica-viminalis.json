    "intro": "Chavica viminalis, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial herb native to wetland areas in Europe, Asia, and North America. It features long, narrow leaves that grow in dense clusters, often with a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomes are commonly used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Sweet flag thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies such as ponds and marshes."
