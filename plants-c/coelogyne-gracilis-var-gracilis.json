    "intro": "Coelogyne gracilis var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pendant-like inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are strap-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its tropical environment. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its elegant appearance and long-lasting blooms."
