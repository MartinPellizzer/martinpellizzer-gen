    "intro": "Cayaponia latebrosa var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth cayaponia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other varieties of the species. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
