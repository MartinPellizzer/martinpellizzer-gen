    "intro": "Coccineorchis sneidernii, commonly known as the red orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its vivid red petals and a distinctive, intricate floral structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, often in clusters along the stem. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils of its high-altitude habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
