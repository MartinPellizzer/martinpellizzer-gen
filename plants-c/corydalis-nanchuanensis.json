It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds enclosed in a capsule, which is a common feature among members of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
