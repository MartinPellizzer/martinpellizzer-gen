    "intro": "Christella \u00d7 incesta, commonly known as the hybrid Christella, is a flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is a natural hybrid between Christella monogyna and Christella tetrandra, both native to the Mediterranean region. The plant typically grows as a shrub with evergreen leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though its natural distribution is limited."
