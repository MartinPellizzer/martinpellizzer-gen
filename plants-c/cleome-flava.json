It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom throughout the summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cleome flava is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun. Its foliage is typically covered in fine, hairy textures, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
