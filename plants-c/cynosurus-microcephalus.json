    "intro": "Cynosurus microcephalus, commonly known as the small-headed bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, often reddish stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Cynosurus microcephalus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
