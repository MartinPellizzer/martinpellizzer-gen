    "intro": "Cirsium virginense, commonly known as the Virgin's thistle, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in stiff, prickly hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The showy purple to pink flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
