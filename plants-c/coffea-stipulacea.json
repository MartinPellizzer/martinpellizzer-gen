The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red berries containing seeds used for coffee production. Due to its unique botanical features and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species within the Coffea genus."
