    "intro": "Cerastium mutabile var. caespitosum, commonly known as the mossy chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine, moss-like coating. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for ground cover in damp, temperate climates."
