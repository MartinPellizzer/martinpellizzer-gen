    "intro": "Cecropia adenopus var. lata, commonly known as the broad-leafed ceibapalm, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, providing dense shade. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. It is often found in moist, lowland areas and is adapted to thrive in disturbed habitats. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with ants, which protect it from herbivores in exchange for shelter and food."
