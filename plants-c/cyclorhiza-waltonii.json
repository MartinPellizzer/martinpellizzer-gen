    "intro": "Cyclorhiza waltonii, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique golden-yellow flowers that resemble small bells, typically blooming in late summer. The plant grows in wet, shaded habitats such as swamps and pine flatwoods, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cyclorhiza waltonii is considered endangered and is protected in many states."
