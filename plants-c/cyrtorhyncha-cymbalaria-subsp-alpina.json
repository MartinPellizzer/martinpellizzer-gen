It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features slender stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand harsh alpine environments. It plays an important role in alpine ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
