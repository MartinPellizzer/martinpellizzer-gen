    "intro": "Cachrys pabularia, commonly known as the common wintergreen, is a small evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in acidic, sandy soils. The plant produces tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves remain green throughout the winter, giving it its common name. Cachrys pabularia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness in cold climates."
