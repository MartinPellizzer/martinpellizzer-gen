    "intro": "Clidemia leptoclades, commonly known as velvetleaf or creeping goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the family Euphorbiaceae, characterized by its milky sap and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and disturbed soils. Its leaves are usually alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and covered with a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. Clidemia leptoclades is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
