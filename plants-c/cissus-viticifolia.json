    "intro": "Cissus viticifolia, commonly known as the grape ivy, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in tiny, translucent bumps. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, grape-like berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in ornamental landscaping. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for trellises and walls."
