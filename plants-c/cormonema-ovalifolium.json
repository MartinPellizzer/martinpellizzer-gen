    "intro": "Cormonema ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaved corm plant, is a unique species characterized by its corm-like underground storage structures. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in wet meadows. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and its flowers are small, greenish-white blooms that appear in clusters. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
