    "intro": "Cuscuta strobilacea var. pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on various herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can sometimes negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
