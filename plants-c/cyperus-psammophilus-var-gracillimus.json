    "intro": "Cyperus psammophilus var. gracillimus, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in disturbed or open habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system and reduced leaf surface area. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects in sandy environments."
