    "intro": "Colpodium pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered colpodium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
