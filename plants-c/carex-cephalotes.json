    "intro": "Carex cephalotes, commonly known as the helmet sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, a common reproductive strategy among sedges. Carex cephalotes thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
