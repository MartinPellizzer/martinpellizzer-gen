    "intro": "Cassiope fastigiata, commonly known as the dwarf mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the rocky coastal areas of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine, white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in crevices and on rocky outcrops. Cassiope fastigiata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in coastal landscapes."
