    "intro": "Carex incisa, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and a dense cluster of spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in a cylindrical spike, and it produces small, three-angled berries. Carex incisa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
