    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. arcuata, commonly known as the weeping hazel, is a variant of the common hazel that exhibits a distinctive cascading growth habit. This ornamental shrub features long, arching branches that droop gracefully, creating a soft, flowing appearance. Its leaves are typically oval with a slightly serrated margin, and they turn a vibrant yellow in the autumn. The plant produces small, edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks, which ripen in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
