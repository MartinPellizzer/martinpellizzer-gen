    "intro": "Cyperus iria f. flavescens, commonly known as the golden flatsedge, is a variant of the Cyperus iria species, which belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or golden in color. This plant is often found in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are densely packed, contributing to its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens. It is also sometimes used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated soils."
