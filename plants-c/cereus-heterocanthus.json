    "intro": "Cereus heterocanthus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its spiny, columnar stems and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. These flowers emit a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its slow growth rate and ability to store water in its stems make it a popular choice for desert gardens."
