    "intro": "Carpinus betulus f. quercifolia, commonly known as the European hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, smooth, grey bark and oval-shaped leaves that are finely toothed and often turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, round, brown nuts enclosed in spiny husks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to provide habitat for various wildlife species."
