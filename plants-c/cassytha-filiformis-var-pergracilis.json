    "intro": "Cassytha filiformis var. pergracilis, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using haustoria, which penetrate the host's tissues to absorb nutrients. The plant has thin, thread-like stems that can grow up to several meters in length. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish-yellow and appear in clusters. It is often found on a variety of woody plants, including trees and shrubs, in shaded, moist environments."
