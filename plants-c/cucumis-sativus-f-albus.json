    "intro": "Cucumis sativus f. albus, commonly known as the white cucumber, is a botanical variant of the common cucumber. It is characterized by its pale green to almost white fruit, which lacks the typical green pigmentation seen in standard cucumbers. The plant retains the same growth habits as the common cucumber, including trailing vines and palmate leaves. It is often cultivated for its unique appearance and mild flavor. This variety is valued in ornamental gardening and specialty markets."
