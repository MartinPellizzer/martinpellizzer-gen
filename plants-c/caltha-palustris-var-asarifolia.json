    "intro": "Caltha palustris var. asarifolia, commonly known as the fernleaf marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The leaves are deeply lobed and resemble fern fronds, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in wet soils along streambanks, marshes, and woodland edges. This variant is distinguished by its finely divided foliage, which sets it apart from the typical form of Caltha palustris."
