    "intro": "Cuscuta globiflora, commonly known as the globeflower dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, giving it its common name. The plant's stems are thread-like and often twist around its host, forming a dense network. It is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host, affecting both the growth and survival of the host plant."
