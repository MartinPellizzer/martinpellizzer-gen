    "intro": "Clinopodium maritimum, commonly known as sea coleus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, clustered in spikes, and bloom during the summer months. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its salt tolerance and hardiness."
