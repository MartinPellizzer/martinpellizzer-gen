    "intro": "Carallia brachiata, commonly known as the red hibiscus or the flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or orange bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often overlooked due to the showy bracts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Carallia brachiata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant foliage."
