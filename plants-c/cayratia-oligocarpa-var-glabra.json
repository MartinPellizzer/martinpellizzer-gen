    "intro": "Cayratia oligocarpa var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth cayratia, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) stems and heart-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
