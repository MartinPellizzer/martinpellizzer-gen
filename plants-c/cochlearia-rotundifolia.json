It is characterized by its rosette of rounded, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or coastal areas. Cochlearia rotundifolia is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar structural features."
