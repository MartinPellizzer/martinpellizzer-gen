    "intro": "Cereus virens, commonly known as the green night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems for survival in arid conditions. Cereus virens thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for desert gardens."
