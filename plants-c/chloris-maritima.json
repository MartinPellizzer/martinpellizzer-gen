    "intro": "Chloris maritima, commonly known as sea barley, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and southern Europe. It is a perennial grass that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions. Its flowers are spike-like, with tiny, wind-pollinated florets that contribute to its reproductive success in coastal environments. Chloris maritima plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion due to its extensive root system."
