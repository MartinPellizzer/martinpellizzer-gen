It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and is typically found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting moths for pollination. It has spiny areoles and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
