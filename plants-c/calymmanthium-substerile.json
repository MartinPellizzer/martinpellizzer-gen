    "intro": "Calymmanthium substerile, commonly known as the sterile calymmanthium, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, a common trait among members of its family. However, it is notable for its reduced fertility, with the flowers often failing to develop viable seeds. This botanical curiosity is typically found in moist, shaded environments, making it a challenging species to locate in the wild."
