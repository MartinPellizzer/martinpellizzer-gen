    "intro": "Cola acuminata var. ballayi, commonly known as the Ballayi cola, is a species of the Sterculiaceae family native to West Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its elliptical leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces hard, woody pods that contain stimulant-rich seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of caffeine. Its botanical features make it distinct from other cola species, particularly in its leaf shape and seed structure. The Ballayi cola is also valued for its ecological role in tropical forests."
