    "intro": "Circaea mollis var. maximowiczii, commonly known as the Maximowicz's whitebeard, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its classification within the Primulaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar morphological traits."
