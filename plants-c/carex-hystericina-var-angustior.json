    "intro": "Carex hystericina var. angustior, commonly known as narrowleaf marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and dark green, with a waxy coating that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in a cylindrical inflorescence. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Carex hystericina."
