    "intro": "Cenolophium aspergillifolium, commonly known as the rough-leafed cenolophium, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
