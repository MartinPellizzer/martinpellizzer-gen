    "intro": "Cusparia silvestris, commonly known as the wild spiky grass, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and distinctive, spiky seed heads that resemble small, elongated cones. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed soils and thrives in full sun conditions. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Cusparia silvestris is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges."
