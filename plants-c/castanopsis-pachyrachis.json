    "intro": "Castanopsis pachyrachis, commonly known as the thick-shelled talaud, is a species of evergreen tree native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, edible nuts enclosed in a thick, woody husk, which is a key feature of its botanical structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in primary rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
