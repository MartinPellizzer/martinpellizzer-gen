    "intro": "Craspedia uniflora var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine starburry, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its compact rosette of silvery-gray, woolly leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it a star-like appearance. It thrives in cool, dry climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular subject in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
