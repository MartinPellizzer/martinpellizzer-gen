    "intro": "Cynanchum martinicense, commonly known as Martin's milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by follicles containing seeds with silky pappi for wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, disturbed habitats such as swamps and stream banks. Botanically, it is part of the Asclepiadaceae family, known for its milkweed relatives and their ecological importance to pollinators."
