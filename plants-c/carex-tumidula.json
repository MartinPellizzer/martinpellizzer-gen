    "intro": "Carex tumidula, commonly known as the inflated sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes over 5,000 species of grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in wetland environments. Carex tumidula is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils."
