    "intro": "Cerasus padus var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered wild cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters, featuring slender branches and lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators like bees. Its fruit is a small, yellowish drupe that ripens in late summer, and the plant is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
