It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-white flowers. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
