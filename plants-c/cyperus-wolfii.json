    "intro": "Cyperus wolfii, commonly known as the wolf's grass or swamp spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that rise above narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as along riverbanks, lakeshores, and wetlands. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Cyperus wolfii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
