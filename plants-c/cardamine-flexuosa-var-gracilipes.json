    "intro": "Cardamine flexuosa var. gracilipes, commonly known as the slender water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a waxy coating, and its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in umbels. It has a fibrous root system and produces achenes as its reproductive structures. Due to its preference for wet habitats, it is often found in association with other moisture-loving flora."
