    "intro": "Centaurea tougourensis, commonly known as the Tougouren's thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are composed of numerous small, ray-like florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a compact, bushy growth habit. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Centaurea tougourensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and resilience."
