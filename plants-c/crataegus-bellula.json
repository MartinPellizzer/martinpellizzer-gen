    "intro": "Crataegus bellula, commonly known as the dwarf hawthorn, is a small deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it thrives in a variety of soil types as long as they are well-drained. Crataegus bellula is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partially shaded environments."
