    "intro": "Calocephalus aervoides, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial with a rosette of fleshy, silver-green leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Calocephalus aervoides is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
