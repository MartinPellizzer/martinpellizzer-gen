    "intro": "Crepis taraxacifolia subsp. myriocephala, commonly known as the hairy groundsel, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in dry, sunny habitats. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. The subspecies is distinguished by its larger, more rounded flower heads compared to other Crepis species."
