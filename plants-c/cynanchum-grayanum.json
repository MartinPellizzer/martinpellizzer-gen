    "intro": "Cynanchum grayanum, commonly known as the grayanum milkweed, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots contain a milky sap, which is toxic and has been used in traditional medicine. Cynanchum grayanum is adapted to grow in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
