    "intro": "Cerastium gracile proles carpetanum, commonly known as the carpet cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its prostrate habit, producing small, white or pink flowers. The plant features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to ovate leaflets, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in soil, while its dense growth forms a mat-like carpet, making it suitable for ground cover in gardens. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in woodland areas."
