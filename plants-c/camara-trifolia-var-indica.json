    "intro": "Camara trifolia var. indica, commonly known as Indian nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three ovate to elliptic leaflets, with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to violet, followed by berries that transition from green to bright red. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
