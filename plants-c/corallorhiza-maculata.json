    "intro": "Corallorhiza maculata, commonly known as the spotted coralroot, is an herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungal networks for nutrients. The plant produces a tall, unbranched stem with whorled, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with specific fungi. Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
