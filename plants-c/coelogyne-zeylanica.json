It features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often with intricate patterns. Its leaves are strap-like and arranged in a rosette, aiding in photosynthesis. Coelogyne zeylanica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
