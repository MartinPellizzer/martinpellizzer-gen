    "intro": "Cereus tominensis, commonly known as the night bloomer or desert night flower, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking, white, tubular flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it is drought-tolerant, adapted to arid environments. The flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a single night, making it a rare and spectacular sight in the desert."
