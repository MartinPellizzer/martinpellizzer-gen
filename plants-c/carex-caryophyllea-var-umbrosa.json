    "intro": "Carex caryophyllea var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the eastern United States. It features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are typically clustered in spikelets. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an effective ground cover in wetland habitats."
