    "intro": "Cyathochaeta, commonly known as the \"butterfly flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, butterfly-like flowers that often display vibrant colors such as red, yellow, and orange. The inflorescence is typically a cyathium, which is a cup-like structure that holds the flowers and is often mistaken for a single bloom. Cyathochaeta species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and the Americas. They have hairy stems and leaves, and their flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, especially bees and butterflies."
