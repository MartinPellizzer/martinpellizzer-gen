    "intro": "Chamaenerion angustifolium var. canescens, commonly known as the silver willow or white fireweed, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. This variant is distinguished by its more pronounced silvering of the foliage compared to the typical form of Chamaenerion angustifolium."
