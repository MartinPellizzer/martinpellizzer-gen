    "intro": "Crotalaria tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow or orange flowers. The plant produces underground tubers, which are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb. Crotalaria tuberosa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
