    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe pennelliana, commonly known as the Penell's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, giving it a dramatic appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Crocodeilanthe pennelliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
