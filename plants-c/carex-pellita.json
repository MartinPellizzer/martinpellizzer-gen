    "intro": "Carex pellita, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Carex pellita is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse ecosystems."
