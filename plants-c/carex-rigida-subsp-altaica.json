    "intro": "Carex rigida subsp. altaica, commonly known as the tall sedge, is a perennial plant native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are typically found in clusters. This subspecies is often found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
