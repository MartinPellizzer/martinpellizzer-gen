    "intro": "Cephaloschefflera panayensis, commonly known as the Panay umbrella tree, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Panay in the Philippines. It belongs to the family Sarcandraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like crown formed by its branching structure. The plant features large, palmate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland to montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
