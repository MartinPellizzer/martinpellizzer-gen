    "intro": "Cordia subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cordia, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters and has simple, elliptic to ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy upper surface. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange to red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
