    "intro": "Cistanche allochroa, commonly known as the yellow parasitic wormwood, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western China. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a branched, yellowish stem covered in fine, hair-like structures. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to extreme temperatures and low moisture conditions. Due to its unique ecological role and medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and herbalists alike."
