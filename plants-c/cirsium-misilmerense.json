    "intro": "Cirsium misilmerense, commonly known as the Misilmeri thistle, is a rare and endemic species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flower heads, which are typical of the Cirsium genus. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often in mountainous areas, and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cirsium misilmerense is considered a vulnerable species."
