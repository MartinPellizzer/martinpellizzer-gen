    "intro": "Cola ballayi, commonly known as the African cola nut, is a member of the Sterculiaceae family and is native to tropical West Africa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, with thick, rough bark and elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers followed by oval, woody pods containing the characteristic cola nuts. These nuts contain caffeine and are used in traditional medicine and as a stimulant. The plant's botanical features make it well adapted to the humid, tropical environments of its native region."
