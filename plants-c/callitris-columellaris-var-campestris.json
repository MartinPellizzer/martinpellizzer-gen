    "intro": "Callitris columellaris var. campestris, commonly known as the coastal or beach callitris, is a variant of the coastal mountain pine. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen conifer that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant has needle-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain the plant's seeds. This variant is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
