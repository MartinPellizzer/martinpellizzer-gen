    "intro": "Caulanthus lasiophyllus, commonly known as the woolly silversword, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal areas of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces a tall, flowering stem that bears small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a spike. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
