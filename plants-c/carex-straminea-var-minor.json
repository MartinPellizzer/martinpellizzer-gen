    "intro": "Carex straminea var. minor, commonly known as the slender flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically light green to yellowish in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in late summer, which are borne on spikes that are often hidden among the foliage. It prefers moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
