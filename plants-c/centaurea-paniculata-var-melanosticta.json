    "intro": "Centaurea paniculata var. melanosticta, commonly known as the black-stained centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of bright yellow to orange-red flowers. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This variety is notable for its dark purple or black markings on the calyx, which give it its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
