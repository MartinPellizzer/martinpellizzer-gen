    "intro": "Callitriche connata, commonly known as small waterstar, is a small aquatic herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. Its small, white flowers are borne on short stalks and bloom in the summer months. Callitriche connata is often found in shallow water and can form dense mats on the water surface."
