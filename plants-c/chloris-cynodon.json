    "intro": "Chloris cynodon, commonly known as common grass or African couchgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Australia, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, flat leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are borne on slender stalks. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its hardy nature, Chloris cynodon is sometimes used for erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
