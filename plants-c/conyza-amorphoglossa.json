    "intro": "Conyza amorphoglossa, commonly known as the white cocklebur, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features opposite, hairy leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, often with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, spiky fruits called burs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along streambanks. Conyza amorphoglossa is known for its wind-dispersed seeds, which have hooked bracts that attach to animals or clothing."
