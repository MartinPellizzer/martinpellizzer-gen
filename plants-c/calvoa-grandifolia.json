    "intro": "Calvoa grandifolia, commonly known as the grandiflorous calvoa, is a rare and unique plant species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with dense, leathery foliage that helps it thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and hummingbirds, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to habitat loss, Calvoa grandifolia is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
