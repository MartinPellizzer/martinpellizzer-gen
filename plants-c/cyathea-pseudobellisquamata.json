It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its large, robust trunk and pinnately compound fronds. The plant exhibits a distinctive trunk with a fibrous, spongy texture that resembles bark. Its fronds are typically broad and can reach lengths of up to several meters, contributing to its dramatic appearance. Cyathea pseudobellisquamata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
