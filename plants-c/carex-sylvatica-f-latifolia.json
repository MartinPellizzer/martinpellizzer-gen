    "intro": "Carex sylvatica f. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sedge, is a variant of the common sedge native to temperate regions of Europe. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are broader than the typical form of Carex sylvatica. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, wet meadows, and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes and naturalistic plantings."
