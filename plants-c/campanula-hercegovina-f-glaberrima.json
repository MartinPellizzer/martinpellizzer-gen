    "intro": "Campanula hercegovina f. glaberrima, commonly known as the Hercegova\u0144sk campanula, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant characterized by its smooth, glabrous foliage. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is native to specific regions in the Balkans. The plant features bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in late summer. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a sought-after species in horticulture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
