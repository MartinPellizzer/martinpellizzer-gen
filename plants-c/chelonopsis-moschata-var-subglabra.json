    "intro": "Chelonopsis moschata var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth-fruited chelonopsis, is a lesser-known member of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its smooth, pale green fruit surface, distinguishing it from other varieties in the species. The plant typically grows as a trailing vine, with heart-shaped leaves that are slightly lobed. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The fruit, while not commonly cultivated for consumption, is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and genetic traits."
