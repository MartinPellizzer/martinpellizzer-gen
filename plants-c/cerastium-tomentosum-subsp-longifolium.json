It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically hairy and elongated, giving the plant its subspecies name. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and streambanks. This species is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its compact growth and ornamental appeal."
