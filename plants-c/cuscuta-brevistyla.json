    "intro": "Cuscuta brevistyla, commonly known as the short-styled dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid growth habit, often forming dense mats on its host. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through contact with the host plant. It is found in various regions of North America and is considered an invasive species in some areas. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it can significantly weaken or kill the plants it parasitizes."
