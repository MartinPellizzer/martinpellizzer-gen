It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive arrow-shaped leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with poor soil conditions. Cousinia sagittata subsp. iranica is often found in rocky slopes and gravelly plains, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
