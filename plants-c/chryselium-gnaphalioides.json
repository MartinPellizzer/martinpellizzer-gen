    "intro": "Chryselium gnaphalioides, commonly known as the silverleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodland edges and wetlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silvery hairs, which give it its distinctive appearance. Chryselium gnaphalioides is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native range."
