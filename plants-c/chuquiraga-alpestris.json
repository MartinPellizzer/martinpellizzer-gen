    "intro": "Chuquiraga alpestris, commonly known as the alpine chuquiraga, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool and dry conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Chuquiraga alpestris produces small yellow to orange flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
