    "intro": "Cerasus juliana var. alba, commonly known as the white Japanese cherry, is a variety of the Prunus species native to Japan. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The tree has a compact, rounded shape with dark green, oval leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, sour tasting fruits that are not typically eaten by humans but are used in traditional Japanese medicine. This ornamental plant is highly valued for its aesthetic appeal and is commonly planted in gardens and public spaces."
