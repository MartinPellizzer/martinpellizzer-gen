    "intro": "Collinsonia cuneata, commonly known as redroot germander, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a reddish hue on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and long-lasting blooms, making it a popular choice for native gardens."
