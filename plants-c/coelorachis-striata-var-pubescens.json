    "intro": "Coelorachis striata var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy leaf fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its fronds are pinnate, with a soft, velvety texture due to the fine pubescence on the leaves. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal in both indoor and outdoor gardens."
