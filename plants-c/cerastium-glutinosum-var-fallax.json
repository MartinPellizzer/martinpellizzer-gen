It features prostrate stems that produce small, white or pinkish flowers clustered in umbels. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a sticky, glandular coating. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's morphology and growth habit make it well adapted to wet, temperate climates."
