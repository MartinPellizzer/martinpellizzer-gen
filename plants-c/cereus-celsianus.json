It is a small, spiny cactus that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features a short, cylindrical stem with prominent, white spines and produces pale yellow flowers at night. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming make it a striking addition to desert gardens."
