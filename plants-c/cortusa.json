    "intro": "Cortusa, commonly known as the goat's beard, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Saxifragaceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a textured surface, contributing to the plant's ornamental appeal. Cortusa species are often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. These plants are valued in gardens for their delicate appearance and ability to thrive in partial to full shade."
