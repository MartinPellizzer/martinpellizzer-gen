    "intro": "Cyathea polystichoides, commonly known as the broad-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizome system supports the growth of the trunk and anchors the plant in moist, shaded environments. Cyathea polystichoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in horticulture and landscaping."
