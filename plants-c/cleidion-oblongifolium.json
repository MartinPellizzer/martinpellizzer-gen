    "intro": "Cleidion oblongifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a distinctive white or pale waxy coating. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in catkins, typically blooming in the spring. Its bark is thick and flaky, providing a rugged appearance, and it is often found in moist, lowland areas. The plant is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
