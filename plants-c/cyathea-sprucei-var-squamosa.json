    "intro": "Cyathea sprucei var. squamosa, commonly known as the squamosa tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the trunk, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing cones, are located at the base of the fronds, typical of the Cyathea genus."
