    "intro": "Centradenia, commonly known as the African star of Bethlehem, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. The plants are characterized by their opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. They produce small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, fleshy fruits. Centradenia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
