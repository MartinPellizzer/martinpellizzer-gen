It typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm and features opposite, hairy leaves that are lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that are surrounded by pale green bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Conyza thapsoides is known for its ability to spread rapidly through wind-dispersed seeds, making it a common weed in many regions."
