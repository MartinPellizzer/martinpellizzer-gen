    "intro": "Cedrela febrifuga f. ternatensis, commonly known as the Ternate cedar, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes many valuable hardwood species. The plant is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits. Its wood is highly prized for its strength and durability, making it a sought-after material in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
