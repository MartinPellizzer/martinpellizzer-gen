It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds. The plant typically grows on damp, shaded rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid environments. Its leaves are small, leathery, and covered with minute, scale-like structures that give it its distinctive appearance.
