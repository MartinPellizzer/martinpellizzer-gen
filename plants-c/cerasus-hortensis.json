    "intro": "Cerasus hortensis, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or dwarf cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the Prunus genus and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 2\u20134 meters and features oval, serrated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its fruits are small, sweet cherries that are edible but not as commonly cultivated as other cherry varieties. Cerasus hortensis is often grown for ornamental purposes due to its showy blossoms and graceful form."
