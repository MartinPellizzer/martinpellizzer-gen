It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color, blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous underground stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. The flowers are often visited by early pollinators such as bees and hoverflies."
