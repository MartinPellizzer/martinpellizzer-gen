It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the cool, arid conditions of its habitat. This variety is notable for its resilience and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 3,000 meters."
